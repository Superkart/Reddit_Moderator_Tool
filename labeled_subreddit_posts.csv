###How to Contribute:

Write a story or poem, **no more than 800 words** in the comments using **at least two** things from the three categories below.  The more you use, the more points you get.  Because yes!

After you are done writing, please be sure to take some time to read through the stories before the next SEUS is posted, and tell me which stories you liked the best. You can give me just a number one, or a top 5, and I’ll enter them in with appropriate weighting. Feel free to DM me on Reddit or Discord (Alyxbee on Discord)!

WritingPrompts,"[PI] The hero, normally jovial and humorous in their interactions, steps into a watering hole for villains, shaking with rage, tears running down their face, and with as much patience and calm as they can muster, simply asks ""Who did it?""","Original Post [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1g5kua3/wp_the_hero_normally_jovial_and_humorous_in_their/)

I left my costume’s mask in the alley beside the bar, and went over the plan in my head one more time.

This would be the end of my career. I knew this with certainty. I weighed the value of that career against the burning rage within. The scale flashed melted, leaving me with only a core of hatred and an unalterable purpose.

As I walked into the entrance of the bar, the bouncer tried to stop me. I recognised him, a low-level criminal member of an organized crime family. Wanted. Two counts aggravated assault, three counts robbery.

I didn’t hear the challenge he issued me as I strode past him, but I felt his hand grab my shoulder. I flexed, and sent energy coursing along his arm, across his chest, and into his heart. Two hundred thousand volts, or near enough.

His crispening and smoking corpse went into immediate rictus, and he collapsed to the floor, fidgeting and spasming with post-mortem muscle contraction.

*They don’t understand*, I realized, *They don’t know what I’m capable of.*

Through my career, I had never killed. The bouncer was an underwhelming first. Confident in my restraint, my code of ethics, he’d overestimated his ability to stop me.

I turned the corner into the main room of the bar. 

Loud conversations and laughter slowly died away, as I stood alone and still, in the center of the room.

A man across the room stood up and called out to me.

“What are you doing here pretty boy? Gonna do some tricks with a light bulb?”

Laughter rippled around the bar, and from somewhere behind me, a glass of beer was thrown. The glass bounced off my shoulder, showering me with sticky, pungent ale.

The laughter howled in approval and several people turned to resume their drinking.

I pointed at the man who had called out to me, one finger extended in a direct line at his forehead.

Two million volts.

The arcing flash of lightning didn’t deviate from its path. It impacted the villain in between his eyes. The bar rattled as the report of the discharge boomed in the confined space. David Wellis, also known as Hurricane, fell to the floor in a slump. Twelve arrest warrants in seven countries. Murder. Extortion. Arms dealing.

The rest of the bar went deathly silent. I couldn’t be the hero they thought I was. That man would never kill. He would restrain with electricity, sure, but none of them had ever come to harm. That hero had a perfect arrest record.

Slowly, they realized that hero no longer existed. Their eyes widened. Some slowly reached for concealed weapons or stood, preparing to flee.

In a quiet whisper, I asked the room.

“Who did it?”

Three of them from the nearest table rushed me.

Twelve-Hundred volts. Into the floor, walls and ceiling throughout the entire bar.

Every person in the room screamed, collapsed, and writhed. I kept the voltage going, fueled by my anger and rage. Tears began to stream from my eyes.

I walked to the nearest man, who had fallen to the floor still clasping the knife he had been intent on wounding me with.

I knelt beside his head. I looked him in the eye and asked him.

“Who did it?”

I abated the voltage, just to him, just for a moment.

He took a ragged breath, “I-I-I don’t-”

Two million volts, my palm against his forehead. The smell of burnt flesh filled my nostrils. It smelled like the beginnings of justice.

I stood again, and walked to the next.

TrueOffMyChest,Want to fulfill all your wildest dreams? Become a Reddit mod!,"Picture this: You're soul searching in between jobs, enjoying the single life to discover your inner self and allowing your mother to live above you and all you ask her for in exchange is a daily delivery of dino chicken nuggies and a refreshing bottle of mountain dew. It all sounds perfect, right? So why does it feel like something's missing? Well look no further because we have the solution for you...

**Reddit Moderation!**

What could more perfectly complement your fulfilling lifestyle than playing internet cop on Reddit? See a post you disagree with? You can delete it! User making valid points and hurting your feelings in modmail? Mute them! Having a bad day? Just ban a random, unsuspecting individual!

`**Disclaimer for Mod Code of Conduct purposes: you can't actually do any of this`

On to more serious matters,

We are in need of more moderators to help maintain the subreddit. No experience is needed. All we ask is that you have the time, patience and a good sense of humor. Our team will be available to train you and answer any questions you have. Communication is a *must* and really, why wouldn't you want to talk to us? You'll be placed on a probationary period to start and we fully understand that mistakes will be made and activity may fluctuate. Please note that being selected as a mod does not guarantee you will be a permanent addition. Not everyone is a good fit and that's okay.

So what does moderating actually entail?

* Clearing the queue will be your #1 task. The queue is where you'll see any content that has been reported or our automod has flagged for review. All you have to do is go through it, read the content and decide whether to remove it, approve it and sometimes report or ban a user. The queue fills up *fast* and needs a lot of attention. Seriously, some of you need to lay off the spam reports.
* Modmail is your next task. It's mostly users asking why their post is missing (automod ate it 99% of the time) and asking that you fix it. We also recieve ban appeals here. If you're lucky, you'll get a death threat every now and then. Hooray! If any modmails are uncomfortable, too personal or upsetting to you, you can delegate it to another mod.
* Sometimes a post will come up that's especially spicy or attracting a lot of attention. When this happens, one of our mods likes to comb through the comments for violations or sit on it to monitor incoming comments for violations. If it gets too much to handle, or someone isn't available, you can lock it.
* Communicating with the team is one of the most important tasks in your role as a moderator. As a team, we discuss moderation actions, rule changes, sub events and the direction of the subreddit. That all sounds very boring but rest assured, there's a lot more casual talk than anything else so feel free to chime in on Beaver's dislike of garlic bread (encouraged), Tim sharing new sanrio drops or my Call of Duty K/D ratio.
* Lastly, let's talk about the meta. Sometimes things need doing on the sub, like this recruitment post I was supposed to make months ago. While the day to day is important, we also need to keep the sub up to date with new features and tools and update it to fit the growing userbase.

If you managed to get through all that, congrats! You made it to the actual app, which is also long and annoying. Here's a tip for applying: there is a short quiz portion to the app. We don't care if you get everything right, we just want to see your line of reasoning and understanding of the rules and subreddit culture.

[APPLY HERE](https://forms.gle/RwSTF7VQbPE4Djta9)

These apps are open indefinitely, and we will be doing staggered recruitment, so feel free to take your time.",108,0.9,74,BvbblegvmBitch,2023-12-27 00:24:23,18rtwhw,182,High

No, your hot takes about the election, whether celebratory or gloomy, are not what this subreddit is for.

No, making a post titled ""WWIII"" to bypass the filter (which includes both Trump and Harris) won't convince us to leave your post up.

There are many, many places to talk about the election on and off of reddit.  This is not one of them.  We've had dozens, possibly hundreds of posts removed.  Given that nobody reads these pinned posts or the rules on the side, I expect we'll have dozens to hundreds more!

TrueOffMyChest,I ended my relationship and my pregnancy in the span of a week,"I don't have any family to talk to about this. I haven't told anyone about it and I can't. I know they'd disapprove at the very least, and at worse, disown me.

My (now ex) boyfriend had become increasingly abusive throughout the course of our relationship, but it really escalated once we moved in together. It was just verbal for a while, and I stayed because I thought I loved him. I thought that if I helped him and gave him the support he needed then he could be a good person. He could be the person I fell for in the first place. I know that was just an act now, but I really believed it then.

He choked me during an argument. I don't think I've ever been that scared in my life. He was someone I didn't even recognize. He apologized afterwards, he cried, he got me flowers and said he didn't mean it. He said he was just angry at me because I wouldn't stop ""pushing"" him to have a conversation about his drinking. He said he'd never do it again.

He didn't know that I was pregnant. I hadn't told him yet because I wasn't sure what I wanted.

For about a week after that first incident, he was that charming and kind and considerate person I fell for to begin with. He was so gentle with me, he kept telling me he loved me, that he would give me the world. I received more flowers that week that I had in the course of our 4yr relationship.

I secretly made an appointment both to confirm the pregnancy and to terminate. It broke my heart. I want children, I want to be a mother, but I couldn't have his baby. I grew up watching my mother be hurt by a man who said he loved her, and it took me so long to heal from that trauma. I couldn't do that to my child. I couldn't bring them into this world just to raise them in an environment like that.

I considered continuing the pregnancy and just trying to get full custody after I left him, but I didn't want to take that chance. If I had a child with him I would have never gotten away from him. He would have been a part of our lives forever. I never would have been free or safe. I was afraid that child never would have been safe with him either. I just kept thinking that if he wasn't afraid to hurt me, what would stop him from hurting them?

So I terminated the pregnancy, I secured a job and an apartment in a different city. I packed all the important things up while he was held up at work one night and I left before he got back home.

I'm working on getting a protective order, and I just changed my number. I just feel so overwhelmed with all of this. It's like my life is some sort of awful movie and I'm watching it from the outside.",1089,0.96,86,Lucky_Leadership2630,2024-11-13 11:23:46,1gqi7k7,1175,High
TrueOffMyChest,Husband abandoned me and our kids,"3 weeks ago, my husband of 11 years decided to abandon me and our kids. I’m the primary provider and only asked that he pays for the electricity bill since he only works part time. We got into an argument, because I found out that he hasn’t paid the electric bill in months  and our power is getting shut off in 8 days. I have always paid for all of our living expenses, family outings, kids expenses, etc. so I don’t understand how my husband claims he never has any money, but he doesn’t pay any bills nor does he provide any money towards our kids expenses. When I questioned him about where his money is going he decided to abandon us and move out of state to go back with his parents. We have 4 kids, (10 year old twins, 7, 4). I can’t afford bills plus childcare for 4 kids. I’ve been going to work late and leaving on my lunch to drop off/pick up my kids.

TrueOffMyChest,"I (37,M) cannot take the endless unhappiness of my Girlfriend (33,F) anymore. ","My girlfriend and I are travelling the world, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Korea, Japan. 4 months. Once in a lifetime stuff. 

The entire way around, something has always been wrong, as it has been for the past 5 years. Whether it’s work, her family, her weight, our living situation: always sad. 

Last night, we had arrived in a beautiful, and I mean beautiful, hostel in Cambodia. Huge whole house among dorms. But because it wasn’t what she thought, part of a bigger complex, and she was ill, she was super negative. This place is paradise. By anyone’s standards. By *anyone’s standards*. Then she said “I really regret booking this place” because she found some bugs in the shower. (We are in the jungle). 

Anyway. 2 days earlier she had told me I was causing her to spend too much by eating meals out (we had mainly stayed in hotels) and that she was over budget. I had created a spreadsheet for her detailing all of her finances. How much she owes before the trip. During. And after. She only did it when I pressed her. And it was always emotional. Money was always emotional. Is always emotional. Turns out after doing the spreadsheet, again with my assistance. She is actually fine. 

I feel like I am constantly waiting to be told that the thing I’m enjoying. The life that I am enjoying. Is awful. 

But I love her. She’s attentive. We have the same sense of humor. I understand the way she is because of her depressive mother. She does lovely things for me and takes interest in things I love.

But it’s like a lead weight around my neck. Yes shes had therapy. But it just simply never seems to end. No matter how many times I ask her to stop being so negative. It doesn’t stop. 

I’m tired man. I’m so tired. But life without her, our things, it doesn’t seem like I’ll be happy without it. But I can’t live with it.

TrueOffMyChest,Wanted to be the best wife now I don’t care ,"My husband and I have been together for 11 years. We’ve gone through the ups and the downs , having kids and a house and both work. For the last year I have felt pushed away and place on the back burner from him, I’ve brought it up, I’ve planned dates gotten sitters for the kids surprise gifts , and he doesn’t care. If we cuddle at all he just wants sex and if he doesn’t get it or once we are done it’s back to a screen whether it’s the phone or TV. I noticed our sex life becoming predictable and honestly something I no longer looked forward too. If he hugged and kissed me I knew it wasn’t out of love it was for lust. 100% of the time never just loving on me to make me feel loved. A while ago I informed him that I felt it was best for our relationship him To stop using porn. He was constantly trying to film us or trying to force me to do things I didn’t enjoy feel comfortable, being more controlling ect. He said he’d try and we’d be honest about it. Well that was another lie and he just downloaded different apps and search engines to hide his use. If I refuse sex he now goes “ you can do it or I can go watch someone else” which of you haven’t been in that position makes you feel like trash. 
I thought I could be a better wife and work out more put out more sexually shower him with more love but I get even less from him when I do. I wanted to surprise him in a few years with a bike and have been secretly saving but after the more recent fights, I’ve decided to be an asshole and use this money for myself on things I want. Since you know he could probably just watch someone else buy their husband a bike.  ",187,0.96,25,JobRepresentative251,2024-11-13 15:10:40,1gqnodr,212,High
TrueOffMyChest,I turned down being a bridesmaid and it ended with cops being called,"My friend Mary has been with her on-again, off-again boyfriend for 5yrs or so. They made plans to get married before but the wedding never happened. Now she was engaged to the same guy for a second time and asked me to be a bridesmaid. I told her I'd love that but I didn't know for sure if I'd be able to since I'd be only a couple months postpartum. Her and her fiancé said that baby care will be up to my husband and I will be expected to do my duties as a bridesmaid. To them that meant no babies allowed for most of the day and drinking alcohol would be required. I didn't have the $200 to spend on a bridesmaid dress and the bride refused to let anyone try to find cheaper options. I was told I was expected to pay $200 for the first bridal shower and another $400 for the second bridal shower. I couldn't afford any of it. Also I was having a tough time with postpartum. I was diagnosed with postpartum depression and anxiety. I tried to talk to the bride about it multiple times and she always said something like, ""that sucks...so for my wedding I'd like these flowers but they're so spendy."" I was getting more and more scared to tell her I couldn't be a bridesmaid so I held off on it until almost 2 months before the wedding. I tried to tell her multiple times before that but she always spoke over me and would guilt bomb me.

Almost 2 months before the wedding I sent Mary a message. I said I was very sorry and explained why I held off on backing out of being a bridesmaid and all the reasons why I couldn't be a bridesmaid. She said nothing and blocked me. Then her fiancé started messaging me and my husband. He called us a lot of names, threatened us with physical harm, etc. He was acting like a complete violent lunatic. At first I tried to calm him down saying I didn't want this to ruin our friendship but then after he said what he did about my baby I told him that he and Mary are dead to me now. He called my baby horrible names, said she will grow up to be a dumb slut and how he hoped she will be assaulted some day, and he even threatened my baby with violence. I called the cops to report it and ask about trespassing orders, protection orders, etc.

Mary unblocked me and said it wasn't her fault that her fiancé said what he did and that I'm the only one who was in the wrong because I waited so long to turn down being a bridesmaid. She also said I was horrible for trying to talk about postpartem because it was depressing and she was trying to be happy and plan her wedding. She said it was my fault she wasn't going to get the wedding of her dreams, that I caused her so much stress that she was going to be hospitalized for a few weeks, etc. I told her basically enough with the lies. ""I tried to tell you multiple times over the last 6 months or so that I couldn't be a bridesmaid but you would either talk over me or guilt bomb me. And if you're not getting the wedding of your dreams then that's because you guys have been stupid with money."" Mutual friends said she partied like crazy at her wedding and that she told them she never saw a doctor so her saying she was going to be hospitalized for a few weeks was a lie.

Now up to today: I still get backlash from this from time to time. I just want to ask everyone who's still clinging to this situation, ""Aren't you tired? Aren't you tired of clinging to so much negativity? Aren't you exhausted from all the effort?"" I feel like a weathered rock being worn away by the elements little by little. I'm tired. A few days ago a neighbor asked me, ""I heard you tried to ruin Mary's wedding?"" I'm not perfect, I should have just came out and told her a long time ago that I wouldn't be in the wedding. I know. But the backlash has been insane. I'm tired of the negativity, tired of being called names, etc. Just wanted to get it off my chest and also ask is it really normal to have 2 bridal showers? Is this a new thing or has it always been a pretty normal thing? For context: one bridal shower was for the small town we live in and the second bridal shower for a big city.",2214,0.98,101,RuKittenMe5585,2024-11-13 01:09:51,1gq7b5y,2315,High

TrueOffMyChest,I'VE JUST GOT MY DREAM JOB BUT I'M WORKING NIGHT SHIFT SO NO ONE IS AWAKE AAAAGGGHH ,"I actually might vomit. 

I'm going to work on a high ropes course on a cruise ship

I have 3 weeks til I leave

It's still conditional on me passing the medical which there's no reason I shouldn't

My friend also applied and I feel like they spoke even more positively to her than they did me so it might even be more of a dream cos we might actually be joining together and will share a room AAAGAGGGAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH

We used to share a room at our old work and so I know we live very happily together and we get along like sisters, we will have now lived and worked in England, the arctic and now in international waters together 😱🤩

I can't believe it

There is so much stressful stuff to do in the meantime

Tell my friend who's house I'm house sitting while he's travelling that I will continue to pay him the tent we agreed because that's a commitment I'm going to continue to commit to.

But I will give the house key to his mum/our other friend to pick up his mail every now and again.

I have to tell my job I need to leave in less time than the notice period actually is, hopefully the holiday I have left over will make it okay 

But I think I've been a good enough member of staff they will understand when I say it's been a job I've wanted for 10, TEN YEARS, and I just so happen to have got it and it will mean I have to give 3 instead of 4 weeks notice.

TrueOffMyChest,"I’m 18 and about to receive $120,000 from my grandpa. Obviously this is amazing but I have mixed feelings.","
FYI my grandpa is still alive (he’s 101) but I guess he’s giving me and my sister $120k each? My dad emailed me this morning that 120k was transferred to my sister and the same will be done for me soon.

But idk. This is huge money, and I feel bad that it’s not really my money. I didn’t earn it. Like my friends work hard to get $15 an hour working fast food, meanwhile I’m sitting here getting 6 digits for free lmao. 

But basically my grandpa has done stocks for like 80 years and the money my sis and I are getting is in the stock market, which is fine because I have been trading stocks since I was 15. I’ve actually been doing really well, I have more than doubled my portfolio this year and am at almost 100k, it’s only a matter of time. But I feel good about that money, because it’s mine. I earned it. 

The process of trading my way to the 100k milestone was so fulfilling, and now I wake up to news that I’m gonna be getting more than double what I have now for doing absolutely nothing. It’s kinda anticlimactic if that makes sense. Like, I worked hard for something and took risks, and now I’m about to hit my goal, only for it to be handed to me without me having to do anything.

I’m probably gonna keep it, because as much as I don’t like the idea of being handed such charity I would feel worse if I got rid of it. I know I sound like some stuck up prick for not being elated at this news, but I come from a pretty well-off family. My dad owns a big real estate company, and he wanted me to take it over once I was old enough, but I decided last year that I wanted to build my own empire by myself, which I know is dumb, but I don’t get anything out of being well-off if it’s not from my own hard work. Living a cushy life with money that isn’t really mine just doesn’t appeal to me. And getting 120k for free feels like it’s kinda defeating that point.

But idk. This is just a pointless rant basically. I don’t know what my objective with this post was other than to tell someone how I really feel about it.",285,0.69,370,delt-man,2024-11-13 10:34:39,1gqh0fg,655,High
TrueOffMyChest,GF’s Strength Was Awesome,"A few years ago my wife (gf at the time) (21F) and I (22M) were walking down the beach late one summer night. To put things in perspective I’m about 140 pounds & she’s about 120 pounds so we’re both smaller people.

I started giving her a piggyback ride down the beach & carried her a decent way. When she hopped off & continued walking she then said she wanted to give me a piggyback ride…I remembered thinking “yeah she probably can carry me since I’m not a big guy but probably just for a few seconds”. 

So I agreed & hopped on. As soon as I hopped on & she started walking she goes “oh wow this is easy peasy!” and just starts carrying me down the beach without a problem. She walks a little ways and then says “Haha I could run with you like this” and right when I was about to be like “yeah right, I kinda doubt that”…she takes off RUNNING down the beach with me on her back!! I was in awe that she not only was doing that but she was making it seem so easy & effortless! She also didn’t even seem surprised, like she knew she’d be able to run while carrying me like this. I don’t think I’ve ever felt so weightless in my life and I’ve gotta say I would be embarrassed to admit this to anyone but having my GF do this to me was an AMAZING feeling!!",161,0.95,17,Camp0019,2024-11-13 10:45:01,1gqh9dw,178,High
TrueOffMyChest,I'm done,"Hi reddit, long time lurker first time-ish poster. I don't really know why I'm writing this here but I need to get this off my chest and this is about the only place I can get my thoughts out. I'm currently sitting on my couch crying my eyes out because I just feel so done with everything.  March of 2023 my wife (of only 5 days) and love of my life for 18 years died after a short battle with cancer. She was my love, my best friend and my entire world. We were childhood sweethearts met when we were 16 and 17 outside my local church that funne enough my dad helped to build and was the reason my parents met and eventually had me. We had our first son young at 20 and 21 it was the best thing that ever happened to either of us. It brought us closer together as a couple and gave us our little man Cillian the funniest most gentle and caring, yet super energetic kid in the world
For a time life was great we were your typical young happy family but when Cillian was 4 my dad got cancer and passed away after a short battle. After that we moved in with my mam for a while and actually went fantastic. My mother was the most laid back cool person you could meet and if I'm being honest i think she liked Shell more than me, if you knew her you wouldn't be surprised.  She was 5'4"" petite with the most beautiful green eyes and a smile that could light up a room, always happy and joking absolutely Stone mad about kids, people and life in general. She was also one of those people who could eat and eat and eat and not put on a pick, she used to make me get up at stupid o'clock to make her a toasties while calling ""Feed me"" down the stairs. She also used to end phone calls imitating Meme from animaniacs saying ""OK I love you, bye bye"" . We eventually moved our when mam was OK to be on her own and had another 3 good years until my mam was diagnosed with lung cancer then her mam died of a brain aneurysm then 3 months after her dad had a stroke and we found out he was also riddled with cancer then passed 3 months after that. Two years later my mams cancer which she had previously beaten came back and after putting our lives on hold to look after her mam also passed away a week before Christmas.  We found out a few days later that Shell was pregnant but we lost him to fatal fetal abnormalities in Apil 2020. For the guts of 7 years it was funeral after funeral, loss after loss but we always had one another no matter how dark life got I'd wake up in the morning and she would be there and that was enough. Then after so much shite and heartache we found out Shell was pregnant again (this wouod have been her 7th) we were so scared but the care she got was absolutely exemplary and in January of 2022 we Welcomed baby Oisín (usheen) our little bubs. We finally thought this was it now its our time,after nearly a decade of putting our lives and Cillians on hold to care for everyone else we were gonna be happy but fat fucking chance. When Oisín was 6 months old Shell found a lump and in the space of 2 months she developed an 8 centimetre tumour and was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of breast cancer.  Chemo didn't work, surgery didn't work and in 6 months she was gone. Not once, not one single time did she ever complain or wallow or feel sorry for herself, she carried herself with such poise and class she worried more about everyone else around her than herself.  True to Michelle fashion when she was lying on her death bed my friends mam came to say her goodbyes and she whispered  ""Marion, I'm sorry for being so much trouble "" . We gave her a beautiful send off and the dust cleared here I am a single Dad widowed at 35 . Apart from my two boys o have absolutely nothing to live for if it wasn't for them I wouldn't get out of bed in the mornings and most likely wouldn't be here. I would never in a million years do anything stupid and leave them on their own, I made promise that  I would take care of them and I keep my promises.  Cillian is the most amazing kid in the world and I would be genuinely lost without him but the fact he lost his mam so young and that Oisín won't know her kills me. Life doesn't feel the same without her, food has lost its flavour,  things that used to bring us joy feel tainted and I wake up everyday thinking ""here we fucking go again"" I spend most days counting down the hours until bed time. I go between being numb and closed off to not being able to think straight to having moments of Clarity where the reality of it all hits so hard it takes the wind out of my lungs. With a the shit we had to deal with we always had each others backs and I fucking hate my new reality.  I'm doing everything I'm supposed to, I go to work give the lads as normal a childhood as possible but I hate absolutely everything about it. I was lucky to have found love,  true actual love with the most amazing beautiful person on the face of the planet and now I'll never see her again. The pain is indescribable its a hurt hollowed out feeling I wouldn't wish on my own worst enemy. I just needed to get this off my chest, if you've read this far thank you and give your significant other a hug the things we fight and argue over are so asinine and unimportant. What I miss most is that  cuddle and kiss as I came home from work everyday or how she'd hold my hand when we were in the car. At the end of the day that's the shit that matters . I love you so much pet I hope we will see each other again some day💜",61,0.97,4,Daveballs87,2024-11-13 15:25:03,1gqo0me,65,High
TrueOffMyChest,Dad's new girlfriend saw him mask off for the first time,"My dad has always been kind of a dick, but he's good at playing nice at the start of a relationship. He can be charming, witty, self sacrificing... for a little while. Until he gets comfortable. Then he becomes how he is with my mom and my siblings: Demanding, irritable, lashing out over tiny things, guilt trippy, all the good stuff. He's not physically abusive or anything but there is a damn good reason my mom divorced him and all of his three kids are distant to him.

Recently, he got a new girlfriend. She's honestly really lovely, and I like her a lot, but I always feel a sense of dread. Like, should I try to warn her? Would she even believe me? Like I said, he's very charming in the beginning and is good at playing the logical, level headed person in every situation he might look bad. 

Until a week or so ago.

He invited myself and my brother to go to an event with him and we agreed. (This kind of ties back into the 'trying to be a proper dad now that we're all nearly adults' thing in previous posts. It feels like too little too late, but I didn't want my brother to be alone with him because I know how he gets, especially towards my younger brother, so I agreed to go.) It was early in the morning and he offered to stop at a diner for breakfast, and I know my brother really likes the diner even if I wasn't personally hungry, and so I said yes.

We get there, and it turns out that only my brother is hungry. Apparently my dad didn't want to go in the first place. My bet is that he asked to be courteous and look good for his girlfriend and wasn't expecting a yes. We sit down and my brother is checking the menu while my dad continuously presses him to pick faster, making him panic more and more.

He starts talking about how we're taking up a table, how other customers must be mad at us, how we're wasting the waitress' time, etc. Mind you, we had been there for maybe a few minutes tops. His girlfriend is looking more and more uncomfortable and concerned as he continues to get more angry at my brother, who at this point I can see is freezing up and looking like he's going to cry. He even takes his menu at some point and snaps at him to 'JUST CHOOSE!'

This is exactly why I chose to go. My brother needs time to process things and make decisions, and my dad ALWAYS loses patience with him. He ordered blueberry pancakes and then got up to go step outside to get some fresh air, clearly shaken. My dad starts griping and grumbling and is shocked when the second my brother is gone, his girlfriend and I start grilling him. I had already been trying to tell him to chill out, that there was no rush, the event didn't have a time limit and no one cared that we were taking extra time. He argued with me, but the second his girlfriend spoke up, he instantly backpedaled. 

I ask him why the opinions of strangers that he can't confirm are more important to him than his son's comfort, and he starts to talk about how other people's time is important until his girlfriend also joins in to back me up. He gets all quiet and frustrated, because he clearly doesn't want to look like an asshole in front of his girlfriend, but he also doesn't want to admit he was wrong.

He gives a non-apology when my brother gets back (Y'know, 'i'm sorry you felt that way', a million excuses as to why he was still kind of justified, etc), and my brother is just quiet. We still ended up going to the event because my dad would be too distracted by friends to be a dick, and we had a good time away from him. But it was SO SATISFYING knowing that his girlfriend Saw. She saw a glimpse of what he's really like around 'loved ones'. 

I almost let it go, but today made me want to post about it. My brother, who has had time to process how he felt about it and what happened, is still hurt and upset with my dad, and is thus a little less responsive. My dad decided to complain to me about how my brother still hasn't forgiven him and how it's so unfair, despite never giving a proper apology. The entitlement astounds me. He has some timer on forgiveness but never sees a need to just say 'I'm sorry' without tacking on a million reasons why he wasn't actually at fault. 

Told my brother he was complaining because frankly, I don't think you're very sorry if you're going to be so demanding about forgiveness. ",4088,0.99,89,Draglitch,2024-11-12 15:50:11,1gpwjnj,4177,High
TrueOffMyChest,My fiance cheated on me and everyone in his family knew,"Just found out that my (25M) fiance (22M) cheated on me yesterday, and worst the guy who cheated on me was the one who told me everything. 
My now ex and I have been together for 4 years now, everything was going alright. Approximately by July a situation came up where my mom was having financial problems and I decided to help her, this caused a fight with my fiance as they didn't think it was our responsibility to help her but I did it any ways, after that he was very cold and bitter at me and later found some guy he called his friend.
He managed to convince me that they were just friends and all, yet we constantly got into fights as his so called friend crossed many times the line of friendship, and he always gaslighted me into believing everything was OK.
Fast forward Monday we had a huge argument in which he admitted he said he loved me without feeling anything for the past months, this broke me very much and a few hours later he once again manipulated me with apologies and so on.
Out of nowhere this guy invited me over to his place and when I arrived lord and behold my ex was there, we all sat down and explained to me everything. Turns out my fiance after our fight about my mom met him, they dated but only recently he found out about me and our engagement, my ex told him we were in an open relationship which he believed until our argument of this Monday.
My ex couldn't even se me at the face and I, without a word just left. 
I haven't heard from them since last night and I haven't stopped crying. All these years, all these promises, all these dreams simply gone.
I don't know how to move on nor what to do, I've actually thought to try to simply die, to just gut my self or throw myself of a bridge. Never had these thoughts but I simply don't know what to think nor what to do.",178,0.94,24,Luizoon34,2024-11-13 08:16:43,1gqdurf,202,High

It’s in the back of the fridge and he’s never seen it, so it’s what I use to convince him that he can’t make me mad or my anger makes food taste different.

We were watching the newest season of Love is Blind, and I mentioned that everyone kept describing their partners as “providing them with a feeling of safety”. Our middle daughter asked my wife if she would describe me as making her feel safe? My wife’s reply was “absolutely not. He can’t hear anything. If someone breaks in here at night, we’re all dead”.  My wife is very open and says what she is thinking most all the time.

I’m so devastated by this comment. 😞

Thanks for all the supportive comments so far. 
1. We do have dogs, they bark, I don’t hear them. I swear a mouse fart in the basement wakes her up! (Our room is on the second floor). 
2. When talking about our kids as babies she quickly brings up that I never got up in the middle of the night because I slept through their crying. I did get up, although I constantly told her to wake me up, it wasn’t an issue, and she repeatedly said “no, you have to get up for work and I don’t”. 
3. Pretty sure it wasn’t a joke. There was no smile, grin, sly look, chuckle, like when she is usually being sarcastic or joking. Plus she responded very quickly, which is normal when she says whatever she is thinking. ",6699,0.96,557,NS_6920,2024-11-12 10:39:31,1gpoymj,7256,High
TrueOffMyChest,I’ve had a horrible life,"Growing up as a middle child I was prioritized less. The younger sibling is neurodivergent and the older was insanely intelligent so I was constantly compared. I was insanely emotional and would always cry. CPS was constantly called because of all my crying. This caused me to put in therapy for almost all my life.

At the age of 10, I gained access to the internet. I got groomed almost immediately. The only person to give me genuine attention was a horrible older man. They were disgusting. I didn’t know any better. Thus began the negative chain of events.

At 12, I had gotten manipulated by a schoolmate. I was assaulted by them on my birthday. I was told it was my present. They used my innocence and naivety to their advantage. I never reported it. Went to the psych ward twice and still kept my mouth shut. I was always told nobody would believe me. After this I had dropped out of school. Their harassment didn’t end till I was 15. I got a final message from them on an alternate number. Immediately blocked. 

From then on till I was 16, I had refused to date or interact with people in-person. I had given up on life. I went on spending my years online playing video games waiting for the day I could end my life. I never mustered up the courage to go through with it. I had constantly “e-dated” and consistently been used for my body. Rebound after rebound. I craved love and attention. I just kept getting hurt and digging myself a deeper hole. 

Around my mid 16’s I had decided I was going to end it. I wrote degrading words on my body with a sharpie, wore my favorite hoodie, and laid my suicide note on my bed. I left my home at 2 am to make sure I wasn’t caught. I walked to the nearest bridge and was planning on jumping. I failed to realize that it wasn’t actually high up so I decided to go to the main road to try and jump in front of a car. I sat near a lamp post and cried my heart out while staring at the road waiting for a car. After a few minutes of nothing a homeless man crossed the street. He asked me if I was alright and I lied and said “yes.” He started to walk away before he took a step back and spoke to me again. He asked “are you sure?” I balled even harder and confessed how I was trying to commit suicide. He made a light hearted joke “I thought you were some old woman.” It wasn’t that funny but I was just glad to be talking to someone. He began to talk about his life and how he went to prison and was betrayed by those closest to him. I sympathized with him. He kept going on and giving me motivating advice. From then on I chose to get better. We said our goodbyes and I walked back home. When I got inside I tore up the note and went to bed. (Washing off all that sharpie was a pain)

I stopped e-dating. I got an emotional support dog. I made slow progress. I continued to game. I continued to be a hobbit, but at least I was feeling better. I learned how to communicate and everything from that point on got better for me.

I fucked up my life by dropping out and wasting so many years, but it got better. It gets better. Slowly but surely I’m coming back to reality. Slowly but surely my life will be better. I’m trusting life will have a lot of good things in store for me.

TrueOffMyChest,I faked losing my virginity... and it worked out way better than I expected,"Here's a thing I want to share. Just want to get this off my chest because it's kinda funny and a bit embarrassing.

Back when I was a senior in university, I was living in this shared house with three other guys and one girl. We’d all become friends after I moved to the city for school, and the place we rented was old and... very thin-walled. Privacy was Nonexistent. Especially when it came sex.

The others were pretty active in the dating scene. Wednesdays and weekends? Total chaos They where having the time of their life compared to me. The soundproofing was so bad, you could practically hear every move they made. Banging chicks on a weekly basis. Meanwhile, I was absolutely not  there. I was still a virgin, and it was starting to bothering me, and apparently it started to bother *them*. They noticed I was never bringing anyone home, and eventually, the comments started rolling in.

Even the girl in our group called me out on it once at a party. I joked about maybe she could introduce me to one of her friends, but her look made it very clear: not happening. So I decided to get creative.

One Saturday night, I went out with everyone to a club, but at around 1 a.m., I bailed without telling anyone. Headed back to the house, went to my room, and set up my “props” — my Fleshlight and lube. Locked the door to my room, waited a bit, and then started making small sounds, claping my stomach softly with the palm. (I thought about playing some porn in the background, but figured that’d be overkill). Just some mild, believable noises, breathing heavenly. Thrusting my Fleshlight hard to make it make the sqooch sound of wet pounding.

Eventually, I heard one of the guys come home. I could tell he paused outside my door for a second. Mission accomplished. To really sell it, I jizzed into a condom, tied it up, and tossed it in the bathroom trash without hiding it.

Next morning, I woke up late, went out of my room, and was instantly greeted by high fives and fist bumps by a hungover grop of my friends. The girl was super curious, asking all about who “she” was and what she looked like. I played it cool, acted hungover, told them she was a redhead (I like redheads). One of the guys threw in a dumb “ginger” joke, which I didn’t like, but I went with it. 

Anyway, this apparently became a “thing” – ""everyone"" now thought I had a thing for redheads. Fast forward two months, and guess what? The girl in the house introduced me to one of her new friend wich was a redhead. Pretty. Liked very much. We get together that night and she ended up being my accual first!. (We even dated for a year and a half)

So yeah, my whole “first time” happened because I faked it with a Fleshlight. But it worked out very vell, I lost my virginity.

**TL;DR:**  
I faked losing my virginity in college by pretending to hook up with a girl in my room, using a Fleshlight and some strategic noises. My housemates totally bought it. And the joke that I was into redheads led to my female roommate introducing me to her redheaded friend, who became my actual first girlfriend.",4036,0.97,62,Chicken_Of_The_Year,2024-11-12 11:39:27,1gpqfcz,4098,High
TrueOffMyChest,I had a miscarriage,"I'm 21, been in a relationship for 5 years, and honestly, I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. Even if I did, I’m not sure I’d want to share it with them. I don’t want people to think I’m just looking for attention or pity. 

I’ve always practiced safe sex, but there was a part of me that secretly hoped it would come back positive during one of those scary moments. Even though I was young, I’ve always felt like my role was meant to be a mother. To be the mom I never had, to give my child everything I didn't have growing up. I know this probably sounds silly to a lot of people, but it just felt right to me.

It all started with unbearable pain. I was at work and spent an hour in the bathroom, bleeding more heavily than I ever had before. I’ve always had heavy periods—sometimes so bad that when I’d get out of the bathtub, blood would be dripping down my legs. But this time felt different. I told my boss I was having another episode of an UTI and ordered three pregnancy tests saying I was ordering some pain relief medication. They arrived in half an hour. In that time, I bled through a tampon, a pad, my underwear, and my pants. I took the tests, and all three came back positive. In that moment, I knew exactly what was happening. 

I wanted to cry and go home, but I had four more hours of work to get through. Thankfully, I always keep an extra pair of pants with me for situations like this, thanks to my history with UTIs. I texted my boyfriend, and he was kind and supportive, patient and loving. He reassured me, I know this isn’t the right time for me to be a mom. Emotionally, because I’ve got some trauma to deal with, and financially, because we don’t even live together. We cant afford rent, let alone a baby.

Part of me feels empty, while another part of me feels a sense of relief. I’ve always longed to be a mother, to give my future child what I didn’t have growing up—to be the kind of mom who is present, loving, and caring. I always promised myself that my kids would have a different life than I did, and I set the bar really high. I can’t help but feel so sad about all of this. 

I’ve been diagnosed with E. coli, and the doctor told me the fetus wouldn’t survive anyway due to dehydration. They said no baby could survive in my uterus as long as I have this illness. Knowing that it’s harder for me, always harder, just makes it feel even more unbearable. My head is filled with ""what ifs."" What if I can’t get pregnant again? What if this happens again and I have to go through all of this? What if I’ll never be a mom? What if my boyfriend really wants a child and decides to leave me because of this? He says he’d never do that, but after five years? Ten? Fifteen? Who knows? Certainly not me, and not him either.

I can’t help but feel a certain jealousy when I see other moms with their babies. I feel empty and bitter. Why can they have what they want and I can’t? I try to distract myself—watch movies, read books, cook, bake—but in the end, it’s just me and my thoughts, and they won’t shut up.

I will keep trying to think positive. To think that in a year or so, everything will be healed and I will have my chance, whenever I want, whenever we are ready to start our family. I can't keep blaming myself for this. It was not my fault.

Sorry for this long rant. I just needed to get this out.",24,0.81,20,Longjumping_Put_1326,2024-11-13 13:40:45,1gqljcf,44,High

I have a male work friend and earlier he came over. This was a huge mistake on my part and I think I shouldn't have done it. But nothing happened. He was just passing by and stopped to give me the charger I left at the office. So I invited him for a coffee. My husband returned home, as he was out with friends too. My coworker left and he started asking me questions and telling me I disrespected him by bringing the guy here. But in front of him he didn't act weird. He was friendly, they talked and joked around.

 The conflict between us got worse, we both raised our voices. In the end he slapped me so hard that I had marks on my cheek for more than one hour. All his fingers. I got genuinely terrified and simply stormed out the house and went to my father.

I didn't tell him what happened, just that we had a big fight. My father never liked him and tried to talk me out of this relationship.

My parents divorced two years ago, and after that, my dad completely cut off contact with us—no calls, no messages, nothing.

I realized this because each time one of my siblings reached adulthood, he would immediately stop paying their support.

Then recently, something unexpected happened: my aunt (my dad’s sister) who lives in the same country suddenly reached out to me after all this time, just to check on us and ask about my siblings. But when I told my mom, she was furious. She accused my aunt of being a hypocrite and manipulative, and she almost took my phone away to prevent me from talking to her again.

I (20M) had been dating this girl (20F) for a couple months since the beginning of the semester. We both are German with her being from Hamburg and my family being originally from Frankfurt. We both go to school in the United States. We both sat next to each other in our German class and instantly took a liking to each other. I was hesitant at first since I have had my heartbroken numerous times since coming to college but decided to give it a shot. We went out numerous times on study dates, dinner, and to some college parties together. We both loved hanging out with each other. After Halloween, she decided she want to have the ""what are we"" talk and I agreed.

We went to dinner the Thursday after Halloween and had a great time. I was making her laugh, she was making me laugh. We had a great time.

The next day we were texting non-stop throughout the day and had plans to meetup that night at my place to watch a movie, hang out, or just do stupid couples stuff. Then a few hours before I was supposed to go pick her up she sent me a text stating that she was thinking about our conversation yesterday and how she really doesn't think she can be a good girlfriend with her busy schedule because she is rushing a sorority and she is changing majors. I said that we can work through that and the semester is almost over anyways and I asked if we can discuss this in person. She came over, we discussed it for a few minutes but she ultimately decided to end things. I am honestly devastated. She had been completely honest with me throughout the whole time of us dating and we both loved hanging out with each other. She even spent the night over at my apartment. I am honestly just shocked that she ended things so abruptly and I am extremely disappointed. This was last Friday.

TrueOffMyChest,"As the holidays near, I wish I had a dad now more than ever...","I have gone no contact from my parents and it's only been about a year... a short summary (the full post can be found on my profile):

My dad groomed and raped my aunt which resulted in my sister. I never got to meet this side of my family but understood my sister to be my ""cousin"". I was 30 when I found out the truth. My mom knew about it and covered for him. In addition I found she lied for him when he would physically abuse me by choking or hitting me by telling family that could help that I was the aggressor. She actively prevented people from helping me in childhood to make sure he wouldn't get in trouble. 

Anyways, flashing forward to today and they are not in my life but live 30min away. I see posts of people loving their moms and dads so passionately... I make jokes like ""must be nice"" but really, it must be incredible to be loved like that. It took me a year to get to this point of grief and I assume it's because of the holidays. 

Let me be very clear. I do not wish my dad was back in my life whatsoever. I've never felt so free. I mourn the idea of what a dad is supposed to be knowing I will never get that and never have those memories in my childhood. I'd be lying if I didn't say I was jealous/envious of my friends that reach to their dad for hugs and kisses and protection. They fully trust their dads in a way that is just so fucking foreign to me. I don't even like being hugged because of my parents. 

I am in therapy sort of. I'm too poor to do it as regularly as I'd like but I'm trying my best. I feel so alone and abandoned. 

My other sister does still talk to him and my nieces and nephews love him... I don't think they know and they wouldn't believe me if I told them anyways. Hell they'd probably justify it based on his age and how I should let it go. 

I'll never let it go. He could die anyday now. He has poor health and is 82... I always imagined I wouldn't cry when he died to be honest but now... I think I'd scream cry at the fact that he lived and died a monster instead of doing the one fucking thing I needed him to do, which was to be my fucking dad. My protector, my ride or die, my bud, my confidant. Ugh, so emotional tonight. I just wanted to call him dad and fucking mean it, ya know?

TrueOffMyChest,Sister expects normal relationship after years of traumatizing me ,"TW: addiction, alcoholism, abuse

My sister is a recovered alcoholic. When she was drinking, she did a lot of horrible things that traumatized me. Lots of verbal abuse as well as physical abuse. She is better now and expects a “normal sibling relationship” (her words), and that I need to “calm down” because “I’ve changed” (her words). But I’m not quite where she is yet. I don’t think she understands the magnitude of the damages she’s done to me. It’s great that she’s recovered and moved on living a better life than before, but to expect me to just forget what happened and have a “normal sibling relationship” feels almost impossible for me. At least not for now. I’m tired of having to explain to her why I’m distant and don’t see her often. I already told her I’m not ready, and I need time. But she does not hear me. Just venting.

My girlfriend has been nothing but supportive this entire time. She believes in me so much, that I'll find another great job, that I'm smart, that I'm worth it. She believes in me way more than I believe in myself. 

Yet I can't even look at her. I feel like a loser who squandered a great opportunity. I lost faith in my ability to both get and maintain another comparable job. I feel doomed. When I look at her, I feel like it's only a matter of time before she gets sick of or disappointed in me. That she'll resent me, the same way that I resent myself right now. Sick of having an unemployed, unconfident boyfriend. 

If this keeps up, I'll probably break up with her soon. I'm a sinking ship, and I don't wanna drag her down with me, so to speak. She'll be hurt, but I love her enough to know that she deserves better and can get better. 

Thankfully we don't live together and she's not dependent on me for anything.

I did not do this thing, this was the first time I'd heard them say I'd done this thing, and I had screenshots to show that they had NEVER brought this up to me as a problem in our friendship. There have been instances in the past where Apple has told people I did something that I didn't do and I've given my perspective of events and they are very very different than Apple's.

That maybe I did do that fucked up thing and I just don't remember it or I didn't think it came across that way but it did. I've worked hard to get to a better place

Fast forward several months. My ex (Orange) comes into town. We ended things on decent terms like a year and a half ago, but haven't seen each other. So, we're going to get coffee as friends and catch up. 

The day we're to get coffee, I check in to make sure it's still happening and Orange let's me know that she wants to but isn't in a good place mentally as she just found out she was cheated on. Apple and Orange dated years before Orange and I dated. They broke up, remained good friends, and about a year after Orange and I split up, she started dating Apple again. 

During their first relationship, Apple cheated on Orange and then lied about it and has kept it a secret for literal years. They came clean to Orange recently and that's why I know about all of it. The friends who had no reason to doubt Apple? They are all now aware that Apple was lying for years. 

I'm not fucking crazy! Apple is a God damn liar and I feel so validated! I doubt any of my former friends will apologize or own up to the mistake, but I don't care. I don't need them in my life. Obviously, I feel bad that Orange is going through all of this, but I feel so validated!",782,0.97,22,OceanBlues28,2024-11-12 13:53:30,1gptq82,804,High
TrueOffMyChest,Today my aide cooked what should not be cooked,"I have to get this out, because today feels like an actual nightmare I keep expecting to wake up from. 

I'm disabled, and need help with stuff around the house. Today was the second day with a new agency and new home health aide, ""Tina."" I set it up so she would come by in the morning while I'm sleeping (insomnia is killer), and I texted her last night what I would need done today. 

One of those things was to roast some precut squash I'd gotten so I could have it with my salads and pasta. I was very clear in my instructions: what it looked like, where it was in the fridge, how to use the oven, how to cook it. I also have a roommate who was up and told her she could ask them for help if she couldn't find anything. Or come get me if truly necessary. 

Now, I have three pet ball pythons. They eat rats that I thaw from frozen in the fridge in a reusable plastic bag. Yes, that's where I'm going with this.

Tina couldn't find the squash, and so, obviously, that meant she should roast the first other thing she could see that was technically also encased in plastic, in a completely different area of the fridge. The FUCKING RATS. In butter and salt, in my nice baking dish. 

And like, that's insane all on its own, but if you're going to cook any animal, you should at least clean and skin it first, right??? Like, do the crazy, disgusting thing properly so I can respect the effort, instead of sticking them in as is. Fur and guts and all.

And the smell. Good God baby Jesus the SMELL. It woke me up and had me gagging the moment I opened my bedroom door. Definitely not squash. Or food-smelling for that matter. At first I thought the squash had spontaneously rotted overnight and she'd tried to cook it anyway. That would have been slightly less insane and much preferable. 

I had to pull it out of her what she was cooking instead when she said she couldn't find it (it was in plain sight), had to open the oven and see my snakes' dinners in place of my own and still couldn't process what the fuck was happening, what I was looking at and smelling. I don't like yelling at people and generally avoid it. Today was a day for exceptions. And at the end of my half-crazed, dissociative rant, I told her to get the whole dish and its contents and herself out of the fucking house. And to not come back.

Suffice to say, I've contacted the agency to report it and am requesting a new aide. Now I'm sitting at a cafe trying to calm down and eat something despite the scent memory that's taken up permanent residence and turning my stomach. The whole house reeks like musty, sewage-dipped pork that had been left out for a whole day before being cooked in rancid oil, and I'm not sure Febreeze is gonna cut it. I don't want to go home. 🫠😭",1097,0.98,141,CptnSpaceCase,2024-11-12 11:44:33,1gpqjs6,1238,High
TrueOffMyChest,Working with kids makes me extremely depressed now that I know I’m infertile.,"I really thought this was going to be my career. I love working with young kids. It’s so fulfilling to watch them grow and play and turn into (largely) kind, empathetic human beings. I’ve had several students where I’ve just sat back and gone, wow, their parents are doing something right. I hope I do well enough so that my kid grows up to be as polite, or thoughtful, or confident as they are. 

And then I got the news that I have endometriosis. 
It’s not always a guarantee that a person with endo is infertile, but the odds aren’t stellar (50/50 or so I’ve seen). And I’m not even concretely sure how bad mine is yet, but it went untreated for a very, very long time, and I just have this feeling it’s probably ravaged my reproductive organs. If the pain is anything to go by, that is. 

And now I’m just so fucking depressed every time I go to work. It’s like this cloud that follows me — every milestone they make, every bad and good day, every time I send them off with mom or dad, I think, that’s never going to be me. I am never going to share that moment with my own child. I will never tie their shoes or hi-five them after they draw a frankly very awful picture of Spiderman. I will never pick them up from school and get to ask them about their day.

I know adoption is a thing. I’m not saying it’s not a good option for some people, but for several reasons I’m just not comfortable with it.

So I just sit. And I watch these wonderful little people grow and it feels like this huge empty hole in me is getting bigger every day. Like a sinkhole. ",4,0.7,6,girlthingpet,2024-11-13 19:28:35,1gqtdev,10,High
TrueOffMyChest,It feels impossible to believe that things will actually work out for me(f28),"I was in a relationship for 10 years. I started a degree, had a full social life, and the support of my ex-partner’s family. I generally felt like my life was on the right path… heading towards family, kids, a good career. I come from a broken family (divorced parents, and I don’t have a close relationship with my brother), so it meant a lot to me that I connected with my ex’s family and felt at home with them. They filled my life, and my partner was also an amazing person.

Two years ago, I decided to end the relationship because I realized I was in it mainly out of comfort, and the love we once had had faded a lot over the last few years. He deserved so much more than I could give him—he deserved to be loved as a partner, not just as a person. We had neglected our quality time together so much that, unfortunately, I felt it was impossible to restore the lost love.

Now, at 28, I feel stuck in my life. I feel like I’ll never find the right person to be my life partner. I feel stuck in my degree, unemployed, living with my mom. My friends have moved abroad, and my studies are currently remote. I feel lonely, unsuccessful, and stupid for choosing to leave instead of working on the relationship.

Thank you to anyone who read this far—I just needed a moment to let this out and release it ",31,0.88,9,Ok-Lobster-1409,2024-11-13 07:04:42,1gqceno,40,High
TrueOffMyChest,I’m ashamed of myself for letting my 13yo actions upset me ,"I had my son 3 days after I turned 20. I was married to his dad. We got divorced when our son was 4 and have been peacefully coparenting (for the most part) for the past 8 years. I’ve tried to be the best single mom I could be during that time. 

I can’t even begin to express what a special child I grew inside me. He has never gone without yet he has so much empathy for everyone, especially those less fortunate than himself. I don’t believe in god or reincarnation, but if I did, I would think he had been here before. 

I have been in a relationship with a great man for 3.5 years now. My son loves him and I feel very grateful I found someone we both love. However, I sometimes feel jealous and insecure because the men in my son’s life can do the bare minimum and get his praise and attention.

He loves Home Alone so tonight I planned for us to watch it and I made him 2 cups of hot chocolate. In the middle of the movie, he takes his blanket and covered up my partner with it. I was also uncovered but he didn’t bother covering me. I’m ashamed to say I cried. I planned this nice night for us and he still shows others more consideration than me. It stings but I feel guilty for feeling that way because he’s my child. 


TLDR: my sons behavior towards others makes me feel jealous since I’ve always done my best to give him a great life as a single mom",2,1.0,1,alienkoala,2024-11-13 21:20:30,1gqvk4c,3,Medium
TrueOffMyChest,I'm tired of being everyone's Pillar- I wanna be weak for once ,"I am so burned out and exhausted by my family I don't know what to do anymore- 

I'm only 23 almost 24 and I feel like all I am is the emotional punching bag of my family and there support system to help with their own problems. Trying to cheer up my littld brother and get him motivated to live his life, helping my Mom with her ptsd and manic episodes were she screams at everyone, then my Dad who is a depressed and self destructive person and relies heavily on me emotionally. 

It's so exhausting and mentally it's eating at me- I feel like I can't escape, If I leave they would shatter especially my Dad since I'm scared he's gonna hurt himself. I feel like I can't live my life since I have to hold up everyone else in theirs. I can't even get sick cause I will still be called to take care of everyone else- 

There are times I fantasize about being the 'weak' one in a relationship. Someone I can lean onto and cry, or take care of me. I've had fantasies of a quiet home and being a stay at home wife, even if I don't believe fully in that system I've seen the appeal and honestly- it's so much nicer then my day to day. 

The idea of opening up to someone to tell them I'm sad, or that I'm worried without it being turned into a comparison game or a attack, just getting to slow down and enjoy time with another, having someone to dote on me like Id do to them. Hell just time to sit in silence would be nice- Or a hug would be amazing..

I have no job prospects. Sinking in credit card debt. Still paying back student loans. I can just not seem to do the right thing. My last hope was to possibly study for web development and I fail at that too. I’ve been telling myself for the past 4 years that I would do it. I ended up pissing these last 4 years for nothing. And now the job market is even worse. Everything that I do or touch just goes to shit. No assets to my name. I don’t know what to do anymore. Everyday just goes by and I don’t seem to realize it. One blink and I lose a month. I’ve constantly failed the people around me. Disappointed them every single time. My whole life seems to be built on a lie that I created.

TrueOffMyChest,My boyfriend keeps speaking (flirting?) with his ex,"my boyfriend and i have been friends going on a decade and started dating in early june of this year. this was right after (im talking days) he broke it off with his ex. i know that they occasionally talk, but i assumed it was only in a group setting as they share the same friends. 

however, i noticed that they had called a day after our last monthly anniversary for no reason i can think of. i asked around and apparently at the start of our relationship (less than 3 weeks after we started dating), he had texted things like:

him: “im still fond of us”

him: “i want to go to sleep but i keep thinking about eating”
her: “eating what”
him: “you”

him: “i still think you’re evil every time you bend over”

him: “i wanna see 😭” in response to her saying shes laying alone in bed

they also called for two hours at the start of august and i know they used to or do talk on snapchat, although i was told he deleted it recently. 

is this as big a deal as i think it is? i feel so hurt and sick to my stomach to think he may have been unfaithful, especially since ive made sure to cut off a guy that i was having relations with prior to us getting together. at the time of these texts, i was also suffering major health issues as a result of our first time together and i still feel these effects. should i talk to him, and if so, how? i cant justify snooping but i just had an inkling that he wasn’t being 100% honest.

TrueOffMyChest,I resent my dad for treating me like a burden,"When I was in my teens and early twenties, my dad would constantly use money to shame me. When we got into an argument after my high school graduation, he shouted at me “fuck you, pay for your own college.” He did end up taking out loans to help me out, and I took out some in my name as well. When I moved home for graduate school, he always made sure to remind me that I was “living rent free in his house” and that I should be grateful. There’s more examples but you get the gist.

I was a good kid that got excellent grades and even graduated early. I’ve always had a job, ever since I was 18 years old. I was out of his house by my 23rd birthday and got married a year later. I haven’t asked him for a penny since and I don’t plan to.

Here’s where it gets weird. Now suddenly my dad wants to start giving me money again. He talks about paying for my husband and I to have a real wedding because we eloped (which only cost us $100). He insists on helping with the down payment when we buy our first house. 

I don’t know how to tell him that the thought of taking his money makes me want to throw up. I spent my entire early adulthood working myself to the bone so I never had to ask him for anything. I resent him for making me feel like that. I resent him for my hyper independence and making me feel like I can’t ask people for things.

On top of all this, my younger brother is unemployed, in his late 20s, and has been living at home for 2 years. I can guarantee you he’s never been subjected to the same treatment that I was. 

I don’t want to take my dad’s money for anything, ever again. I wish I could tell him why but I genuinely don’t feel like it would make a difference for him to know. If you’re still reading, thanks for listening. I really did need to get that out. ",24,0.86,4,Scary-Act-9611,2024-11-13 06:50:11,1gqc51c,28,High
TrueOffMyChest,I broke up with my fiancé after 11 years,"This really sucks. I’m not writing this for validation or any solutions, I just want to put this out there for myself to look back on when I inevitably want to change my mind. 

I’ve been with my fiancé since high school. The first few years were really dramatic with our own personal lives but our relationship was fine. We moved in together very early, at 18 years old. During these years with us being so young we’ve had a lot of traumatic things happen so I fear this caused an unhealthy attachment to one another. 

For the last few years, I’ve notice I’ve lost all physical attraction to my partner. I began feeling like they were just my best friend that I got to come home to every day which was fine for me and fine for them too as we had this discussion. However, as time went on, we were more and more aggressive with each other. Never in an abusive way but it just seemed like the more time we spent together, the more irritated we both got with one another. They have a lot of qualities that I do not like such as, constantly forgetting everything, getting mad when I have assignments (I’m still working on my masters, they graduated a few years ago), jealous of my friends and colleagues, and constantly calls me mean, fat, dumb, etc and when I get upset at the name calling they always say “why can’t you ever take a joke”. 

All of this, I think has caused the flame to dwindle more and more down until it extinguished and I feel like it can’t ever come back. We’ve had another conversation six months ago where we almost broke up but agreed to try and work on things instead of ending all of the work we’ve put into our relationship. I felt like for the first month, everything was fine although, I still could not find the physical attraction for them. Then after that first month, everything just reverted to how it was. 

When I brought this up to them, it was not taken well at all. Since then, they have been begging for me to change my mind but I truly feel like there’s no coming back. I love them so much, I just want a partner that I am physically attracted to, that I enjoy being intimate with. Part of me wants to stay in this relationship, we are genuinely good friends, I know they will be a good father, they are really good with my psychotic family, and they would give the shirt off of their back for anyone who needed it but I know this isn’t healthy for either of us. 

It really hurts that I hurt them so bad. They seemed to be living in ignorant bliss. I want to uncall it for the simple fact that it’ll make them happy. I just feel so lost and broken now. ",12,0.75,7,notacopcop,2024-11-13 09:34:52,1gqfl1y,19,High
TrueOffMyChest,Imposter syndrome,"Just need to talk/cry into the void. I'm 34 yr old. Decided I wanted to make something more of myself (a bit too late in life) and I'm about 4wks away from finishing up my 1st semester of community college. I'm rapidly losing steam and getting more anxious which is turning into depression. So many assignments stacked up on each other with major exams coming up and little to no time to study.

I've tried the cliche college life with losing out on sleep to stay caught up and study but as soon as I got out of class I just passed out because I was so tired. So too old to pull that off. I don't get how I'm supposed to maintain 45hrs a wk studying on top of work and life. It's getting to be much.

But what is really crushing me is the fact that I'm in class with these kids half my age with sooo much talent like holy fuck why are they even in school with this much talent. Like seriously they get a win at life card! My art skills is soooo many leagues under them. Like what am I even doing here? I'm making straight A's but realizing am I even learning? Have I learned? Then realizing by the time I'm out of school I'll be almost 40. Who wants to hire a 40 yr old entry lvl graphic designer?? Not to mention I can't design to save my life. Professors say I got great out of the box thinking not clear concepts and my colors are too much. I get I need to learn and that's why I'm there but it just feels like I shouldn't have been making these mistakes this close to the end? So I guess I haven't learned?

Not to mention most my classes no one takes seriously and never turn anything in. No lie less than half always turns shit in. The other part just turns it in whenever, so I'm already trying to hard. Just starring to feel like I should drop out after this semester and work my current job full time. Keep seeing the design business is over saturated etc etc post. So I'm just at a loss on what I'm doing. I'm tired of feeling lost. This will be the 2nd day in a row I missed because I can't get out of my head.

TrueOffMyChest,I feel like I'm failing at life but I'm only 19.. ,"
I'm not even sure how to begin writing this post, I'm just pouring my emotions out in hopes to be able to finally fall asleep, because I've been laying awake just overthinking for hours now.

I honestly feel so miserable, I feel like my life is falling apart because I can't do anything right. I fantasize about ending it all daily and the only things keeping me alive right now are my mom and siblings.

I feel like my life started slowly going downhill when I started getting bullied at school and when my dad became an alcoholic. I've been struggling on and off with a self harm addiction since I was 12. I slowly started to put less and less effort into everything, started despising myself, feeling like I deserve all the suffering.
I feel like I'm constant pain not only mentally, but also physically. My head hurts 24/7. It's been hurting non stop for the past couple years.

Everything really started snowballing and crushing me last year when I got into uni. I had some issues within my close family that led to legal actions being taken and the process is still going on (I don't wanna disclose all the details). I was also trapped in a relationship I didn't want and I didn't know how to get out. I started losing a lot of sleep. Studying became unbearably hard. 
In the end I cracked under the pressure and failed, causing me to repeat the year which I'll get to later. Just a few days after, my beloved cat has passed away. This was the worst day of my life and I feel like it was the final string, it finally broke me. I was not able to leave my house for a couple weeks, all I did was cry, eat and sleep. I was ready to take my life, but never actually went on with it. And to be honest I never got better. I still think about my cat and it never fails to make me cry. 

After all of this, my sleep problems became worse then before. It takes me at least an hour to fall asleep and I can never wake up on time, no matter how many alarms I set. I get incredibly stressed out even about the littlest thing, my headaches keep getting worse every day . Now I'm repeating the year like I mentioned before. I've been trying my best to study, really putting in my best efforts but I'm so scared that I'm gonna fail again. I study and then feel like I still don't know anything. I stress out about every exam and every morning. I'm scared that I'm not gonna wake up in the morning. I try to go to bed early, not using my phone but I'll still end up staring into the emptiness for hours. 
Tonight when I wanted to sleep I started stressing out about everything again. Now I've been laying awake for at least 4 hours trying to fall asleep. It's 6 am now and I'm so scared and stressed out about everything. I feel like I'm ruining my life by worrying that much about everything, but also by my terrible sleep habits. If I keep oversleeping and missing my classes the professors will notice eventually and I will get kicked out for it. I don't want to fail again.

I don't want everyone to see me as a failure and I don't want to keep ruining my life like this. My mind and my body are constantly in pain, my body is refusing to listen to me. I sometimes feel like I'm ""beyond repair"" and that I'm only being a burden to everyone. I'm not strong enough to take my own life. I don't want to put those I love in misery. But I often dream about getting hit by a car or getting a terminal ilness. It would still be painful for them, but I feel like it would be less painful than knowing I took my own life.

I'm sorry that this post is so long, I just thought that maybe if I write everything out somehow, it might put my mind at ease and help me finally fall asleep. I hope it somehow makes sense and it's not just a bunch of nonsense randomly put together. I can only hope, because I do not want to read my thoughts again just to put them back in my head.",3,0.71,1,Similar_Cable_5119,2024-11-13 18:49:19,1gqskn6,4,Medium

TrueOffMyChest,My ex wrote a poem for me.,"My ex and I have been broken up since May (let's call him V) but recently we've became friends again, I told him about how much I write poems for when I'm sad or feeling romantic and left me on send for a few minutes before coming back and saying that he wrote a poem for me and sent it to me. He said ""watching you fall in and out of love with the world except me."" That weirded me out. I took a break from dating after my most recent ex from early August (lets call him A) and just started feeling romantic feelings, but I'm not falling in love with anyone else but A. We've gotten back in contact and yes I do like him romantically because he's the first guy who respected me and who I genuinely loved. Also A does like me too but we haven't settled on whether or not we should date again or not.

I don't want to date V because he has continued to attempt to manipulate me and get into arguments with me just because I've gotten close to someone or because I talk about someone a lot (FRIENDS.) he's tried to convince me to end friendships with my closest friends just because I was too close and dependent on them.

V also wrote in the poem that he wanted to do the things that I said I wanted to do with A, I said I wanted to go spend time with A in the rain one more time if it meant he could hold the umbrella while we walked and other things.

V said he loved me too. And I don't like it. I just wanted to be friends with him and now It creeps me out that he wants to be more than friends clearly even though I've received the signs more than once.

Earlier today he said that he wants to hate me but he can't find himself to even despise me one bit, that he'd change everything just to make me like him again and that he hates that we fight all the time.

TrueOffMyChest,Hospitalization a few years ago.,"A few years ago, I was hospitalized for “suicidal ideation” as it was called. But people dismiss it and my regrets about what happened that year and how it affected me as if that wasn’t an extremely difficult time in my life. I’ve been suicidal before, but I’ve never been so suicidal where I had go to a psychiatric hospital and was thinking about killing myself every single day and planning to do it every single weekend (when my parents would likely be away). 

It’s like no one acknowledges it. What happened a few years ago still affects me to this day. And yes, I’m still gonna talk about it because I do regret what happened and how it affected my grades, especially since I’ve been judged so many times by everyone for what university I go to which is only because of what happened sophomore year. People I know have  said, “that’s a party school” about where I go but where were you when I was struggling to be there for me? I feel like barely anyone, except for my parents and I think two other people were there for me. And I don’t mean convincing me not to kill myself, but just reaching out to me to hang out or just to talk to me.

Even for people here on Reddit that doesn’t seem to matter when I make a post.",2,0.67,6,Familiar_Form_5345,2024-11-13 15:27:03,1gqo2dm,8,High
TrueOffMyChest,Abuse by parent at 28 years old,"I guess i should also throw up a warning for violence and death.


I don't even know how to start this off. But right now I'm sitting in fear, I have this disgusting very depressed bad feeling in my gut because I want to rent a car for a few days (I have my license and everything) but I'm afraid if I ask my father that he will yell at me and attack me (physically). He strangled me when I was 26 and had a guy in my room. He slapped and punched me several times a year late because he didn't like the lashes I was wearing and hated that I wouldn't take them off. 

At this point when does it end. I just don't know. I'm feeling a little suicidal and stuck here. When am I going to live my life without the fear of it being violently taken away.

He doesn't do this to my brother's (adults) or my.mother but I'm the punching bag (daughter.) I just don't get it and I need some help.

TrueOffMyChest,My Future Mother-In-Law gave us a book about misogynistic sex ,"I have been engaged to my fiancé for a few months now, we are both in our early 20s. We have had a bit of a strained relationship with his mother, my soon to be mother-in-law, for various reasons that I will not get into here - but this was the last straw for me.

While he was visiting home last weekend, she gifted him two identical books with handwritten notes. The books are about sex. When my fiancé cringed as he showed me this strange gift, I felt like I was in the twilight zone. While I thought this was incredibly inappropriate, we tried to laugh about it. Ultimately, curiosity got the best of me so I decided to crack it open and start reading. I expected the content of the book to be about what you would expect a book about sex to be - but I was shocked when I realized this book was teaching incredibly misogynistic principles shrouded in Christianity. Additionally, the entire thing paints all men to be sex driven idiots. Almost everything in this book exemplifies how the burden is on the woman to keep the marriage together. There are many parts that are not only degrading to women, but degrading to men - insinuating that a man will cheat if his wife cannot have sex with him every time he wants it. Many of the passages depict that if the wife denies her husband sexually, any children will suffer because the man will be unable to be a present father, or that he will not be as successful in his work life. My fiancé and I are both religious ourselves, and both find the content of this book to be shocking. I am truly at a loss with this and do not know how to react. I think it is probably best for me to provide some excerpts from the book so you all can see what I mean. There are way too many to list, so I'll just include a few:

""The irony is, an abused woman often runs to marriage specifically as an excuse to say no to sex. She knows her husband isn't going to use and abuse her, so she gladly accepts the offer of marriage, thinking that once she's in the safe confines of matrimony, she can kiss sex good-bye. The sad fact in all this is that the man who really loves a women like this is the one who winds up getting stiffed.""

""If you really love your spouse and he or she, to put it bluntly, really wants your body, you're being selfish if you withhold it.""

""But if you're married, sex will be one of the most important parts of your life, whether you want it to be that way or not. If you don't treat sex this way - as a matter of supreme importance - you're shortchanging yourself, your spouse, and your kids.""

""If you are having sex before marriage, you are ultimately threatening your own happiness and marital satisfaction""

""A spontaneous man needs to learn that his wife may feel threatened by his spontaneity. Conversely, a controlling woman needs to understand that her lack of spontaneity may be boring her husband right into the arms of another woman.""

""A sexually fulfilled husband is a scriptural mandate.""

""But the bottom line is this: to say to your spouse, 'The store is closed', or even 'You can shop on this shelf, but not that shelf' is less than Christian.""

""You can be a the best cook, a great mother, and a fantastic conversationalist, but if you put no thought or effort into your lovemaking, your husband will probably feel disappointed.""

""Women, you're going to need a full medical examination at least three months before your wedding. If you are a virgin, your doctor will need to consider your hymen and perhaps your vaginal muscles. It's far better to go through this embarrassment with your doctor than to disappoint yourself and your husband on your honeymoon because sex means nothing but pain to you.""

""Your husband may feel too embarrassed to buy lube, so I recommend that the wife do this ahead of time.""

(Context: an example of a man who has a porn addiction and how his wife had to compromise because he couldn't handle a week deprived from sex when she has a period) ""The most difficult time for this man was during his wife's period, because she was unavailable to him sexually. After about ten years, she finally realized that pleasing her husband with oral sex or a simple hand job did wonders to help her husband through that difficult time. She realized that faithfulness is a two-person job. That doesn't mean a husband can escape the blame for using pornography by pointing to an uncooperative wife - but a wife can make it much easier for her husband to maintain a pure mind.""

The real kicker is that apparently she gave the same exact book to my fiancé's brother and current wife when they were engaged. Future mother in law raved about how helpful she personally found this book to be (TMI) - and how helpful my fiancé's brother and his wife allegedly found it to be. It is shocking to know that this is not only how she views herself in her own marriage, but clearly thinks that her son should feel entitled to his wife's body. My fiancé feels repulsed that this book pushes the notion that a man will resort to becoming unfaithful and resentful if his partner declines a sexual advance. I believe that women are so much more than an object for pleasure for men. I believe that relationships and marriage should rely on more than if you are willing to ""put out"" so your partner remains faithful. I cannot imagine giving a book that portrays sex and relationships in this light to anyone - but especially not my own sons and their future wives.

While I was already hesitant about my future mother in law, this has pushed me to the point of no return. I really don't know how I'm supposed to have a relationship with her, and I don't think I will be able to change my view of her after this. I'm extremely anxious about the next time I have to see her, especially with the stress of wedding planning and upcoming bridal events. I'm getting in my head about if I am overreacting or not. My fiancé and I will be discussing it more in detail later this week because he has now decided to read it himself after I told him about how upset it made me.",44,0.9,37,memequeen1202,2024-11-13 00:36:58,1gq6ued,81,High

TrueOffMyChest,Caught up in inappropriate messages,"A while back, I got caught up in some inappropriate messages with someone my age on my team. Neither of us should have been sending these kinds of messages, and I feel terrible about it. I didn't send any nude photos (just close to), but the other person did. It was a mistake, and I've stopped, but things are getting complicated now.

Recently, my coach confronted me, mentioning the other person by name. I denied it all, but now I feel trapped in my own lie. From what I've gathered, this person went around telling others a twisted version of what happened, making it sound like I was the only one involved and leaving out their part. There's no proof and all that was reported to him was circumstantial and hearsay. It's basically a big 'he said she said,' with the way snap works it's not accessible anymore either. 

I’m not looking for reassurance because I really am a dick, and I’m not even sure what to do next. I’m aware I made a bad decision, but I'm scared of how this could impact me going forward. I've been getting my story straight and I know that I'm an asshole for this but my friends and most of the team will vouch for me and know that I'm a good person who made some very bad, hormonal decisions. I feel like confessing will just be the worst thing, while keeping this undercovers and building my rapport is the best thing to do.

TrueOffMyChest,My abusive husband had a car accident and now he’s a completely different man,"On August 15th, 2023, my life was turned upside down. My husband got in a terrible car accident. A drunk driver hit him head-on, and his injuries were severe with broken bones, internal bleeding, and a traumatic brain injury. He was in a coma for 6 days and honestly noone knew if he’d survive. Even worse, I didn’t know if I wanted him to.

Our marriage had been awful. He was emotionally abusive, selfish, controlling and at times physically abusive . I stayed because of our daughter. I didn’t want her growing up without a father, but I also couldn’t keep living in fear. I had already started preparing to leave. I saved money, made plans, and had everything lined up for divorce. But when the accident happened, I was hit with this horrible thought I couldn’t tell anyone. I secretly hoped he wouldn’t make it. I didn’t want to keep living in fear.

When he woke up, everything was different. He didn’t recognize me as his wife. He thought I was still his fiance. He was confused about everything, his age, his life also the fact that we had a daughter. It was a bit surreal, but there was something almost refreshing about it. He was happy and kind in a way I hadn’t seen in years. I felt like I was meeting a completely new person. The doctors told me that he is suffering from long-term memory loss. They told me it could take days, months, maybe even years for his memories to come back, if they come back at all. It’s hard not knowing how much he’ll ever truly remember

It took a few weeks for him to adjust to everything. He had to process his physical recovery and the shock of being a father and husband again. Slowly, he returned to work. At first, I was worried he might not be able to cope, but he quickly went from being someone who was underperforming and on the verge of being laid off to a top performer, even earning a promotion. The compensation from the accident allowed us to pay off most of our debts. For the first time in years, we’re financially stable and i felt like maybe, just maybe, things could get better.

Now, he is like a different person. Or rather, he's like the person I first fell in love with. He’s become the kind of partner I’d dreamed of having, the kind of father I always wanted for our child. He’s constantly telling me how much he loves me, how grateful he is to have me in his life, and he dotes on our daughter. I’m not even sure he realizes she’s three because he doesn’t remember her birth. He just accepted it as fact and adores her completely.

Lately, he started to regain some of his memories. He says it’s been happening in flashes. Sometimes, he’ll remember things about our past life, and he gets confused. He often asks me if certain things really happened like if we really went through what we did or if he was truly the person I described. He’ll ask, “Did I really treat you that way? Was I really like that?” And every time, I have to tell him the truth. I tell him that, yes, he was abusive, and yes, he did hurt me. Each time I confirm it, he breaks down crying, apologizing profusely, telling me how sorry he is. He says over and over that he can’t believe that he became that person. 

I know this sounds like something out of a movie, but I’m just living in this surreal reality where I’m finally getting the life I dreamt of. He’s affectionate, attentive, and goes out of his way to make me feel loved. He’s an incredible dad to our daughter, and seeing them together laughing, playing, genuinely bonding brings me to tears sometimes. I’ve never felt so loved in my life. I still find it hard to believe sometimes, but seeing him try, seeing him work so hard, has been nothing short of amazing.

I feel so conflicted. People might think I’m awful for not telling him everything right away, or they might think I’m a fool for staying after everything and hoping he’s changed. But how do you tell someone they were once your biggest source of pain when now they’re the person you love waking up to every day? How do you shatter the hope they have in this new version of themselves? Right now, we’re finally safe and happy, and I want to hold onto this as long as I can.",4030,0.94,235,Responsible-Sense790,2024-11-12 00:29:31,1gpekim,4265,High

What I didn’t know before telling him was that he was seeing a girl, it never really came up, especially because he and I didn’t talk much about relationships, but it became awkward because he liked me back, so we were stuck, we stared at each other for the longest time waiting to be unstuck, and after a while, he told me that we should spend some time apart, no talking, texting, or anything so that we could try to get over each other, I agreed, and we didn’t talk for a little over a month, but eventually things went back to normal, I told him I was over him, he said he was over me, I wasn’t, at all, but I wanted my friend back. 3 weeks after the party, he broke up with the girl he was seeing, I didn’t find out until after we started talking again and I am unsure if it had to do with me. A few months ago he started seeing another girl and at that point, I was 100 percent sure it was over between us. Still, I can’t get over him, we talk every day, we have multiple classes together, and we sit next to each other in all of them, and we hang out constantly.

Please don’t judge me for this as I am 14 and I don’t get a lot of money from my parents. The man working behind the counter called out my name as I was going and asked me to give it back. So I did but he took my number, name and address and I begged him not to tell anyone or get me in to trouble. He said I better give him the right one because he knows I’m there all the time and he could’ve banned me and have my picture up for the public to see you’re a thief. I have to go to this grocery store. I don’t have a choice. I walk everywhere and this is the only grocery store close to me with which I go with my parents also. He is about 35-40 years old, Indian, doesn’t speak English as well as I do. He advised me not to do this and I promised him I would never do this again.

Next day he called and asked me to come see him at 2 and I asked him why and he said that he’s got something to show me before I present to the police and said if I didn’t come at that time he will come to my house. So I told him I have school at this time and I couldn’t but could after school. He agreed to come to a park nearby and to meet him in his car. So he told me that he didn’t tell his boss or the police about this situation and that he was willing to let this slide, but he showed me clear picture and video of me stealing through CCTV camera and that he could easily go to the police. I was crying hysterically and begging him not to do anything and he said he did me a favor by not doing anything against me and suggested I do some sexual favors for him while being reasonable. Im diagnosed with ptsd, anxiety, and getting over CSA so I have an absolutely impossible time telling people no or setting boundaries. I have a boyfriend at the time and he kept asking me what I have done and kept saying nothing. He kept telling me he’s only there for 3 more weeks and will see me and ban me if I don’t cooperate basically and this went on for a while until he left.

He is gone now and I have anxiety if he would ever post this stuff now that he is gone. I don't have him number or anything because the line he calls me in says no caller ID.

TrueOffMyChest,My Dad won’t attend Thanksgiving Dinner if I attend ,"My (36f) Adoptive Dad (AD) and I had a huge falling out when I got married. My Mom remarried when I was young and I lived full time with her and my Step Dad (SD) who I claim as my Dad. When it came to my wedding I wanted both them to walk me down and my AD threw a fit and thought it should only be him. He didn’t come to the wedding. Stopped speaking to me. Wouldn’t be in the same room as me. Ignored my daughter, his granddaughter, threw away gifts from us for years until I stopped trying. 

After my SD passed away, AD wanted to reconnect. I was cautious, it was awkward, but there was a small effort. That year he invited me to Thanksgiving and as we were in the hallway with all the family photos I see I had been physically cut out of family photos. 

It was hurtful and I cried when we left, and still brings tears just typing this. After that I didn’t really put much effort in. If he called I would answer. If I missed a call I would return it later hoping he didn’t answer until it just faded back to the way it was with non communication. 

We are 13 years past the wedding. About 3 years from when we tried to reconnect and my niece is hosting Thanksgiving dinner. We were chatting about who was bringing what and I said is Papa bringing anything and she said “oh he said he’s not coming if you’ll be there so he’s staying home” My niece is level headed and sees it as a him problem. It 100% is on him. 

I had no idea we were back to not being able to be in the same space. If he would have came to Thanksgiving I would have talked to him and caught up. But he can’t be in the same room as me? 

My sister said his memory is shit, he’s been losing him temper at the stupidest things. And alarm bells are ringing. Is something bigger at play. Is he suffering from Alzheimer’s or dementia? Or is he just a miserable prick like I think he is? 

As much as I want to write him off, I will feel bad if something is wrong and that’s not his normal brain. And I feel bad that he’s choosing to not come to a family event because that’s all he wants is to be with the whole family. A part of me wants to let him go and I’ll go to my in laws but I know my niece wants me there. 

Just feeling a little sad that this is where we are.

TrueOffMyChest,I really wish my teachers cared about me in school ,"I really wish my teachers cared about me in school


If you look on my profile theres several of the same posts about how i was the victim of cyber bullying in school, when i was 12-14 years old. On this post id like to focus on how none of my teachers ever picked up on the fact i was the silent and shy nerd no one spoke to or approached in class or in the playground. Im now a student in my final year of university but the trauma of all those lonely days, wishing the end of the school day would come so my mother could take me home, just so i was away from those other kids, still hurts me. 


All i wanted was a normal teen life, friends who cared about me, invited me out, asked me how i was , not to have several of my classmates pick on me and leave me out of things such as hangouts. I ended up once or twice to have to force myself into conversations and cringely ask if i could join in. I hated it everyday, and my form teacher which i think you guys call homeroom, she was amazing, loving , caring and saw all of us as her children. I remember once i gave her chocolates for her birthday when i was 12 and she gave me the biggest hug ever. Shes the only person i felt comfortable with but she didnt notice any of it, my loneliness or the fact no one in class liked me or cared for me. At times i wish i coulda just cried into someone’s arms, especially hers, but no one knew about my problems, no adults or none of my parents, as i was embarrassed. 

If you would ask me if i wanted to relive a day of school or walk through a den of lions, you can guess what im picking.

All i wanted was a normal school and social life as a child, thats all i wanted. Seeing all the popular kids, hanging out, while i just waited for the end of the day and ran home to my PlayStation, where i found happiness. 

No teachers even noticed, and i just wish they did. I just wanted a friend, thats all, but i guess people will always be people. 

Now im gonna make sure when i have a child one day, he or she doesn’t go through what i did. ",2,0.75,1,viper46282,2024-11-13 16:39:19,1gqpqm2,3,Medium

I want the sort of woman who would hold me in her arms and let me be the little spoon every night. Someone who’d wake me up with a kiss on my forehead. Someone who’d call me ‘Good boy.’ 

She said ‘So you want a girl who’d treat you the way your mom treats her dog.’ Which was like ‘Damn!’ She then told me women don’t want guys who’d always be the little spoon and that I sound needy and need to work on what I’m looking for.

TrueOffMyChest,Struggling with My Relationship: Should I End It or Try to Make It Work?,"Hello Reddit, I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a little over two years. A week ago, we had an argument because she was drunk (she usually gets aggressive when she drinks), which led to a series of other fights over issues in our relationship.

She complains that I've let myself go physically, that I don’t diet or exercise, and that I’m completely focused on my work. She also says that we never travel together and that I’m always tired. This is true, but in my defense, I’d like to say that I’m always exhausted because of my job, and regarding trips, while we don’t travel often, I try to take her to the best hotels in the country (this year we went in May, and I've already made reservations for 2025).

We’ve had these kinds of arguments before, but I’ve never found the motivation to change because she has never made an effort to share my hobbies with me (reading, anime, video games). This has led me to enjoy the times when she’s out of town (she has a business in her hometown and travels there several weekends a month), and I use this time to unwind and do the things I love.

Back to the main topic, after last week’s argument, we decided to take a break because she gave me an ultimatum. I genuinely care about her, but I feel like if we get back together, things will go back to the way they were. I’ll try to change, but seeing her lack of interest (I never complained that she didn’t try to enjoy my hobbies) makes me think we’ll just end up in the same place.

I feel like the best thing to do is to end the relationship, but at the same time, I don’t want to.

TrueOffMyChest,I love my wife and want to be with her more than anyone else. I'm going to suggest we divorce anyway.,"We don't fight. There's no violence. There's been no infidelity. There's no substance abuse. Our child is happy and healthy. We're financially fairly successful. Neither of us has any serious health issues, or gained significant weight. We've been together 15 years. We're great partners and friends.

But she doesn't seem to have any interest in me anymore. And it hurts so much.

To start, she doesn't like spending time with me. When we do she normally just stares at her phone. I can't compete with Instagram.

She treats hugging me like a chore. At one point she even had it on a daily to-do app and would hug me then check it off. It felt bad, like pity hugs, but not as bad as when she decided even that was too much effort.

A kiss is something I do to her, or it doesn't happen at all. She seems to have no interest in it. I rarely try anymore.

Sex is a laughable idea. The condoms expired with a nearly full box.

Of course it all started after we became parents. But at this point I don't think that matters.

For a while, I convinced myself that if I just did *more* that she'd finally feel better, have more time and energy to spend time with me, finally come around. But now I do all the cooking, all the cleaning, and most of the parenting. I'm putting the toddler to bed almost every night (not always easy), and when that's finally done either she's gone to bed already or she's sitting staring at her phone, with the kitchen a mess that is waiting for me to clean it. I'm exhausted, and it's changed nothing.

I tried last week to talk about how it felt like she doesn't like me anymore. She said she just needed more time to herself, to *be* herself alone. So I said hey, why don't I take the kid all day Saturday and you just go do stuff and get that alone time. Then after we can do a date night?

She was all for this. Fantastic.

I had a great day with our toddler. She went out shopping and doing her own thing. I put the kid to bed early because a nap got skipped, and we decided to watch a TV show together. 

... Except she spent the whole time staring at her phone instead. I doubt she could tell me much about what we watched. Occasionally I'd laugh at something funny and she'd have no idea.

Fine, okay, she's not liking the show she picked. That happens.

I made a suggestion we go back to the bedroom to ""make out"", which is usually a way we suggest starting there and doing more than just make out. She says yes, and for just a moment I got my hopes up. Maybe I'd finally given enough.

Every time I kissed her, she started to talk about something she was thinking about. Over and over. New topics. Just basically demonstrating again and again that she has no interest in kissing me. For fifteen minutes. Each time, I tried to make conversation. We laughed about stuff, discussed what needed to be done this week and so on. But any attempt to restart anything romantic was rebuffed again and again with the same tactic. Oh sure kissing is fine but did I mention I bought a really cute shirt for the kid?

I gave up. I said I needed to do some chores. She helpfully suggested additional things I needed to get done before bed. And then she went to bed and I went and did chores, then had a beer and then cried.

But when morning came I was at peace with it all.

There is no person I want to be in a relationship with more than her. She's my best friend, my partner, a great parent, a genuinely funny person.

But I don't want to be in a relationship with anyone that isn't interested in me romantically. Am I being unfair to say that?

My need is not to have sex with her. My need is to be with someone that likes kissing me, that wants to have sex with me. Someone that isn't bored of me.

I can't change how she feels. But I can decide to change a situation that makes me feel terrible and lonely all the time.

So I'm going to ask her to either go back to couples therapy, or separate. And it's going to suck.


Some additional notes: 

No, there's no chance she's cheating. She's kind of incapable of being anything but brutally honest. It's caused problems in the past. If she were seeing someone else, I honestly think she'd tell me about it, strange as it sounds.

Yes, this is my fault as well. I don't communicate enough about how I feel. I put her happiness ahead of my own too much. I'm getting therapy for that and more. I don't think it changes how she feels.

I'm writing this for catharsis more than anything else. Your viewpoints are welcome but I likely won't reply much.",5727,0.97,696,CombinationTop1360,2024-11-11 21:39:08,1gpbpjl,6423,High

TrueOffMyChest,To my future Son,"As I write this, I'm only 3ish months away from meeting you... And I am terrified. 

Your Dad is... Mediocre... at best.

By the time I meet you I'll be 30. I'm currently 29 years old, and my life is a mess. 

Just this year alone, I've been through 4 different jobs, currently on my 5th. It's going well, and I'm enjoying it but all your mum has to say to me is 'Dont you dare fuck things up again'. I love your mother. I sincerely do. Before you came along she was my one shining beacon in the world. Now I have 2. I'm working 2 extra jobs and a side hustle to help bring in extra cash but I have a lot of debt. Your Dad is terrible with money. I have no savings. Your mum is supporting us far more than she should be. We make ends meet but sometimes only barely, and I know it's because of me. 

I try to be a good man, but I am probably far from it. I don't think I'm a bad person, but I get depressed, anxious, and angry. I have outbursts, I break things, get lazy, stress, and gods I know I am my own worst enemy. None of my outbursts are ever directed at anyone other than myself and I only ever break my own possessions but I sometimes scare myself. I struggle with my mental health on a daily basis and though I have good intentions, I end up self sabotaging any attempt to better myself. Right now, I just wake up every morning and try not to be a disappointment to your mother and your grandparents, and I'm failing at it. 

Life is harder than you'll ever expect, and you're being born at a time that has never been harder. I may be a monster for even having the thought but I sometimes wish we could've held off on having you. That if we just waited, we'd be in a better position. In every way. Physically, emotionally, financially, politically, it'd all be easier and less stressful if we didn't have you to worry about. But that's not how it worked out. And I'm so grateful for it. I haven't even met you and I already love you more than I've ever loved anything (except maybe your mother, though I suspect that'll change once I hold you in my arms).

I'm not a perfect person. I just want you to know, from me. My harshest critic is myself, but the criticism that hurts the most is your mother's, and eventually, will be yours. I'm okay with letting myself down, or at least, I'm used to it. But it hurts the most knowing I'm letting her down and by proxy, you. I think back to my wedding vows where I promised to never be a burden and to work everyday to be the man your mother deserves, and I broke those promises. 

I'm sorry. It's 1.30am and I'm over tired and rambling. 

Before I go, know that no matter what happens, you will always be loved and supported. You will have a present and loving father. We may struggle from time to time but you will always be cared for and you will always come first. 

I hope beyond hope, I will be a decent father. I also kinda hope you never end up reading this. We'll see. 

I love you Kas. 
I can't wait to meet you.

TrueOffMyChest,Soulsbourne games aren't fun lmao,"I know every one plays video games different and I'm not discouraging anyone from playing any of the soulsbourne titles but man I really think they definitely have been overhyped in terms of gameplay. I love Dark Souls lore for example, but the gameplay has never been something I rave over.

see new boss. ""YOU DIED"". respawn. make a mad dash to said boss. actually get a decent chunk out of his health. ""YOU DIED"". repeat.

I understand people saying that there's some type of satisfaction from defeating a powerful boss, and I do get that cause I have gotten satisfaction from a few boss defeats but fighting the same one over and over again with little to no improvement isn't fun at all.

Even if I do have the patience to beat a boss like this, I get no satisfaction from it whatsoever.

I never grew up playing these types of games, and I really think that these games are overhyped by people who grew up playing them and play them all the time cause they know every secret and detail there is to know. ya know?

I work 8 hours a day 5 days a week, I really don't wanna spend my free time borderline frustrated over a video game. (for anyone who's like ""well just don't play them"" I don't really plan on it.

TrueOffMyChest,My sister hates me and that's killing me ,"I (24 F) have a sister (21F). And we have been close since our childhood, she is not actually my blood sister, she is the daughter of my older sister (38 F) but my parents always raised her as if she were their daughter, and she was emancipated very young and lives at home with my parents, she doesn't see his mother (my blood sister) as such, because of how he treated her, but that's a story for another post. The point is that for 5 years, she has been increasingly cold to me, when I get home she ignores me and never greets me, she applies the silent treatment to me, she never wants to hug me and to a certain point I understood it, because we are not the typical ones sisters who show love to each other all the time, but little by little I began to feel sad about her rejection, and to think that it was no longer that way because of their ""personality"" but rather because they hated me or disliked me. I've told her before how this makes me feel, and she bursts into tears saying that she doesn't act this way for pleasure, that she needs psychological help. And yes, it has been offered to her but she always abandons the treatments. 
The last straw was a week ago, for context I am unemployed and I am struggling a lot to get a job, I found some shrimp in the refrigerator that had been abandoned for weeks and I asked my mother if i could cook something for the next day and not spend on street food, because I don't have any money. I started cooking and my sister yells at me that this is hers, that I'm stealing it and that if I'm going to use them I must replace them the next day. I apologize and ask her to give me a few, she looks at me with a look of disgust and snatches them from me, saying that I can't even pay her for them.I got angry and left her food in the fridge, she warned me that she would use it the next day... it's been 3 weeks since that and the shrimp are still in the fridge 
I don't think it was this specific act, but I realized that she is not the person I grew up with and loved, and this is destroying me, there is not a day that I don't cry and try to improve our relationship but she continues to apply the law to me about the ice, he doesn't even talk to me at all

TrueOffMyChest,"My wife says ""eckspecially""","Which I wouldn't care about, except she constantly corrects myself and everyone else on absolutely any mispronunciation. Not after we're done speaking, no. She interrupts. Or if they're telling an important personal story but get a nerd fact wrong, she has to interrupt them to correct that too.

I've been tempted to take a page from her book to interrupt her with, ""it's pronounced 'especially' "". But it feels like too much of a dick move.

Edit 1: Neither of us is ghetto. She does not 'axe' questions. 😂

Edit 2: We're a happy couple and I do love her. No divorce or anything like that. Just had to spill it here since I don't think I have it in me to spill it to her.

Edit 3: The worst example of the personal story interrupted by factoid, and none of the others are even half as glaring. Our friend was telling us about her recently deceased husband's homemade blades. She showed us one and remarked that it was Damascus steel(it certainly had the signature rippling). My wife interrupted her mid-sentence to tell her that, no, it's not true Damascus steel for some reason I forget but was probably accurate. But I mean, was it really that important in the grander context? I gave her a look and she stopped. She expressed regret about that one after we left. I don't think she understands in the moment how obnoxious the habit is.

Edit 4: I just told her constructively after she showered for work. She was actually grateful. I told her if there were two of her, the other would interrupt her to correct it.

TrueOffMyChest,Today I found out that my uncle has molested our cousin,"I'm still in shock to say the least. One of my distant uncles who has helped my mom pay our tuitions and helped her financially to finance our studies has molested his daughter multiple times throughout the years and to say that I feel disgusted and in shock is an understatement.
 I feel so disgusted, he even came to my graduation this summer to support us cos our mom couldn't come. She lives in another country, our uncle lives in anothr country too but it is relatively close and he didnt need a Visa. 

His daughter is now an adult and she recently gathered the family to tell them about the abuse. It's my distant family(mom's cousins and uncles) but still has helped us a lot.
 Anyways everyone is angry and disgusted and has cut him out and is asking him to report himself. Unfortunately my cousin(the victim) is not willing to press charges but the family wants her to and fortunately my  auntie (his sister )is pushing for them to report the crime but even more disgusting my cousin's mom (who is no longer married to my uncle) is refusing to say anything about it or even support my cousin through this so i dont know if she knew all along that all of this was happening.

We are not close to our cousin first due to that we grew up in different countries ( I have never met her in person before) but we do have each other's social media. We still don't really talk though so I don't even know if I should reach out or something. 

 I guess I just wanted to get this out of my chest cos I am still in shock and tbh I kinda feel ashamed that he's even related to me and that he's been involved in financing our studies.",2,0.6,9,Forsaken-Muffin-3578,2024-11-13 15:27:33,1gqo2tf,11,High
TrueOffMyChest,Grief Over Estrangement?,"I (23M) have been no-contact with my adoptive parents/family going on 6 months by the end of the year. Our relationship has been terrible since the beginning; I was never actually welcomed to truly be apart of that family. It was necessary for me to constantly put on a performance of absolute perfection or else the A.M (adoptive mother) would threaten to harm me or kick me out. Make no mistake, they had two biological children (and another boy that they adopted) that they also treated horribly—but all of us experienced unique forms of whatever the hell we went through. I was isolated and under strict control and supervision for most of my life (yes, even into adulthood). I was ""homeschooled"" for most of my life, too. I only went to preschool, which I was promptly removed from halfway through the year so that A.M could be in more control over what I learned, only... she didn't do anything. At all. She bought me Christian oriented schoolbooks and made me the teacher. Meaning, I had to do everything by myself and if I ever *dared* ask her for help she would sit me down in the kitchen where everyone could hear and scream at me about how stupid and worthless I was for not automatically getting it. So I stopped asking, and consequently stopped doing the work. 

She denied me personhood. I was not allowed to express ""negative emotions"", only happiness. I was not allowed to like or dislike things. Everything that I enjoyed that my A.M didnt was harshly criticized to the point where I had to hide if I wanted to watch tv/movies or read books that she didn't personally enjoy. I could never speak about it either. Verbalizing complex thoughts and ideas was NOT ALLOWED. I was ONLY allowed to say ""yes I agree!"" because if I even so much as dared to disagree, be skeptical of something, or just straight up ask questions it always resulted in a major fight. The best part is that I also wasn't allowed to think deeply about things I KNEW she  agreed with. I don't know if she was threaten by me speaking or what, but she would suddenly pretend like she had the opposite opinion and it would end up as a major fight anyway. 

Now, I could go on and on but that would make the post super long, especially if I list the more severe stuff, so I'll just say this—she had a weird issue with me regarding trustworthiness and personal freedom. Meaning, she denied me both of those. She never trusted me to do anything growing up and made sure to let me know over and over gain that it was because, and this is a direct quote, ""I just can't trust you to make good decisions, especially for yourself."" Whatever. That obviously wasn't going to continue to work out once I reached legal adulthood. Well, she tried anyway. She tried hard. I was NOT allowed to get my drivers license (I had to be driven everywhere by either her or my A.D), I had a curfew which was whenever I got out of work (me getting a job was a huge fight as well), who I hung out with still needed to be vetted, the only place I was truly allowed to go was still church, but now with the addition of work. And if you're thinking ""you are an adult why would you follow any of these rules?"" Good news! I didn't. But that in turn made me the person she always thought I was—deceitful, untrustworthy, manipulative, bad. Someone that needs to be under constant control at all times. Any time she found out I disobeyed her she would become more unhinged towards me until she started getting violent. I ran away at that point and never looked back. During that timeframe I went through a lot of self-acceptance (NOT discovery, because I already knew who I was. I was just terrified of being authentic) and came out as transmasc (ftm). I finally had surgery this year and started testosterone shortly afterwards. When my A.M found out that I was planning on getting top surgery, I genuinely think she had some psychological breakdown. I made the mistake of ""letting"" them be my ""caretakers"" afterwards even though I KNEW she was going to be transphobic the entire time—which she was—but I didn't expect her to hide my pain medicine from me, leave me to literally take complete care of myself (clean myself, change bandages, make food, dress myself, etc...), and finally, when it was time for me to go back to my apartment—state (as the last thing she said to me face-to-face) that no one has or will ever love me and that my existence is satanic. 
[IMPORTANT NOTE: I have an apartment with roommates. I originally wanted to have my recovery at my place as my roommates agreed to help me, but unfortunately neither of them have a car and nor do I. So I agreed to let my A.D (who I'm not on bad terms with) take me, but my A.M demanded that I needed to go back with them to their place because she was convinced I was going to die afterwards and needed to ""make sure I was okay""]

So, after my surgery I cut all contact. I say all of this because I feel like after what I've gone through, I should NOT want to be around these people or even care about them anymore. But yesterday was my birthday. I had to work but I made sure to check the mail before I left. My mailbox was empty so no big deal, right? Well I went to check again today only to find a birthday card from my adoptive parents. It said to meet them at a restaurant they love, at a specific time, so they can celebrate—and for some reason I want to cry. Not out of relief or gratitude or anything; maybe a little out of annoyance that they won't take a hint... but mostly I'm feeling an extremely bizarre sense of sadness at the idea that they might have gone to the restaurant hoping I would show up and I... didnt. I genuinely had no idea and I still couldn't have gone due to the fact that I had to work, but I still feel sad nonetheless?? I just think this is so weird. It's like I'm experiencing grief almost.

TrueOffMyChest,My best friend tortured me as a child,"A couple of years ago I(34F) started going to a new doctor in my small town. I have a lot of scars due to something that happened to me in childhood. My new doctor, Ashley (42F) was respectful about me not wanting to explain the scars. She has been really helpful since I started seeing her. We ended up becoming really close friends.

I kept running into her at the store or when I was out walking. I had been pretty isolated before I met her and she encouraged me to go out more. I realize now she may have purposely run into me. I have spent a lot of time with her and we usually have dinner together and have gone on trips together.

 Recently I was helping her organize her attic and came across her high school yearbook. I found her picture and realized we had met before. When I was 10 I got sent to live with my grandparents friends after my grandfather passed away. They were an older couple with two teenagers, a boy and girl. The girl was 18 and in college, but came home a lot. The parents would ask her to watch me. It was during one of those times when she was watching me that I got my scars. She had a nasty older boyfriend that was a druggie. I'm pretty sure she dabbled in drugs too. 

I guess I was being annoying to them so the boyfriend tied me up with a rope in their basement. He beat me with his belt and some electrical wire until I bleed pretty bad. The girl watched and did nothing to stop him. When he let me go I took off back to my grandma's house. She didn't care or believe my story. I refused to go back to that family and I never saw them again. 

Even though I had bruises and scars my grandma never believed me. I went no contact with her and my family a long time ago. Since then I have not had any close relationships and I avoid people as much as I can, so Ashley was really good for me. When I saw her picture in the yearbook I knew she was the girl who's boyfriend did this me all those years ago. 

I honestly didn't recognize her as an adult and I never remembered names from back then. Since seeing the picture I have been distant with her. I keep telling myself it's not her, but I know it is. I used her name to look up property records for the house this happened in and it was her parents old house. I haven't confronted her. I don't know if she knew who I was all along or not. I suspect maybe she did because of my scars and the brief story I told her about how I got them. I didn't go into detail. I just told her it was older kids that hit me with a belt. She's my best friend now and I care about her a lot. I have no idea where to go from here.",7,0.68,3,Financial_Night8622,2024-11-13 09:17:59,1gqf73v,10,High

She cares about my opinion. Asks me how my day went. Treats it as if I can do anything I put my mind to. This woman is amazing. I open my eyes in the morning and the first thing I do is check to see if she messaged me. As I lay my head down and close my eyes she lingers in my mind until I drift to sleep and then she is scattered across my every dream. I tried to say she was just the best friend I’ve ever known but I can see now I feel so much more for her. It’s been about a week since we have spoken but every day I just miss her more.

TrueOffMyChest,i need help,"I don’t know where else to share this but I need help.

I don’t know where to start. I have a friend who I was really really close to. Our friendship started about 7 months ago. I would share all my stuff with him, do all kinds of stuff. He became the closest person in my life at that point, was always there for me etc. 


About 4-5 months ago, I started liking a girl, who I’ve met from a mutual friend of ours. After meeting her we started flirting etc. When I told my close friend about this he told me that he slept with her once at some point and thought I should know this. This happened when they weren’t in my life whatsoever, about a year ago maybe. Both of them were total strangers to me when this happened.  When he told me about this I didn’t know what to do, I liked her a lot and I tried telling myself “what happened in the past stays in the past”, and forced myself to think that it wasn’t a big deal. He also mentioned that the only one’s that knows about this other than them was me. And told me that I should’t tell this to her whatsoever. The weird part is that I heard the same thing from another friend of mine.

After getting each other to know better, we decided to start our relationship. It’s been about 5 months now and I am really happy, but to this date she still doesn’t know the fact that I know that both of them slept. 

During our relationship we went on a vacation with all of ours friend including him and my girlfriend. During our vacation I saw that my girlfriend was still acting really close to him then. I didn’t like what happened and decided to confront my friend about this. He told me that he would keep his distance which he did. 

The weird thing for me is how can one who slept with someone still act so close, friendly to them like nothing happened between them two of them while being in a relationship while knowing he is a close friend of mine?

Currently neither me nor my girlfriend are friends with him since he moved abroad. Haven’t talked to him for about 3 months. Basically he is not in my life nor my girlfriend’s life anymore. 


I need help because she is the first person in my life where I actually feel cared and loved about. I deeply love her and I really really care for her. No one has ever made me this happy. I need help because every night when I sleep, this scenario comes to my head. This disturbs me deeply. I start asking myself questions like: “Why hasn’t she told me this herself?” , “How did she act like nothing happened before, even though she knew that he was my closest friend at the time?”

When we have sex, sometimes these scenarios pop up in my head and I feel so disgusted by myself.

I feel so bad and I don’t know what to do. I have been feeling this way since the start of the relationship. I really needed to get this off my chest since I haven’t told this to anyone about.


Sorry for the messy explanation and bad grammar. 
I am open to all kinds of questions. Please help me.",1,0.67,3,Less-Pool-2281,2024-11-13 18:17:58,1gqrwv2,4,Medium
TrueOffMyChest,"My bf’s dad is dying, and now I can’t break up with him ","So I have been dating this guy for a very short period of time. It’s been maybe a month since our relationship began and boy it began in a very rocky way. My new bf came with a lot of baggage I didn’t fully understand or even fully know the extent of before I agreed to date him. We completely rushed into things. I do not currently live in the same state as him he’s in the lower 48 and I’m living up in the North very far away. So it’s a li g distance relationship. I was back visiting the state I grew up In for a month or so  when we initially started spending more time together. 

This guy is super sweet but he has had TONS and I mean TONS of trauma in his life that he hasn’t worked through and he’s grieving a big loss still from years ago. I think because of this he has some communication issues. The week before my birthday he stonewalled me All week then waited until 6:30 pm on my birthday to call me. He didn’t get me a gift either. When he called me his buddy was in the background too. Not great. Before he stonewalled me he had been talking about flying me down for my birthday and had asked what I wanted for a gift. 

He stonewalled me because we got into a disagreement over the abusive roommate/family member he was living with. He has a lot of hate and a strange unsettling kind of affection for this this person and he’s trauma bonded to her. She Treated him and me horribly. Not to mention his roommate was acting like a scorned lover when he started to hang out with me, even though they weren’t together and she didn’t know me. It’s very suspicious but we were not exclusive at the time this happened so I can’t really be that upset about it if they were romantic. They clearly aren’t anymore. It was very messy. She kept screaming at him for hanging out with me and the final straw was that she physically attacked him. After that she moved out. 

Honestly our disagreement was a very mature conversation though. Not really a bad fight. No voices were raised I didn’t use blame language. I was trying to ask him to reduce the amount he was talking about his part roomate. He kind of talks about her like people speak about exes. He clearly still has lots of affection for her by the way he talks about her and is grieving losing her from his life. After our calm discussion, He ignored me bc he didn’t want to talk about it. Then every time I brought up how it hurt me by stonewalling he just pretended to lose cell service. And would call back an hour later to see if I had dropped the issue. 

He also just had an abusive roommate move out so he was dealing with that aftermath. 

Well I’m going to be honest here his baggage and the affects it was having on the way he treated me were and are too much for me to handle. I feel like that makes sense since we really have only eachother for two months or three months and truly are still kind of more in the getting to know each other phase. 

He’s just got so much going on that he cannot be there for me, but I’m going g through some hard stuff and I need support from a partner. 

I really get nothing from the relationship. I was going to end it in a respectful way since I really do like the guy and think he’s a good man who is just not emotionally available and doesn’t have the space in his life for anyone. 

Then his father who has been declining g for years needed to go to the hospital. Things are getting very bad for his father. Failing liver and kidneys. He has gone non verbal with me since his father started not doing well. Understandable. 

With everything that has happened to this man I honestly think his mi d will break if I leave him now while his father is dying or directly after. I can’t do it to him. 

However, I myself last year finally escaped my abusive family. I finally cut them out of my life and moved away. Right now was suposed to be the first time in my life that I was able to focus on me and building my life. I should have never said yes to dating him. I know that. I made a wrong decision and now im stuck in a relationship  I do not want to be in 
Because I get nothing out of it and will only be giving for the foreseeable future. I’m just so scared this poor guy is gonna do something stupid of one more thing goes wrong. He certainly doesn’t seem ok. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells here. 

I guess I’m not looking for advice. There is so much more to this that good advice couldn’t be given from just the info I provided. I guess I just needed to shout into the void. Thanks for reading.

TrueOffMyChest,21pregnant F and 22M,"I just need some advice idk my head is spinning for the past two weeks. Long story short my partner and I have not been on the best of terms since we moved states. I'm pregnant with his and I's first child. We been together for 4 years now an some months. We haven't really been getting along since we relocated in june 2024. We then did come to peace and try to work on us and get better for us. In october 2024 we got into a huge argument and fight over a misunderstanding. We were fine after that, going out to dinners, talking about our feelings, spending quality time together after work and cuddling at night. Fast forward I find out that he is texting a girl from work and he kissed her on her ear and claimed in the messages he wanted to kiss her cheek. She flirted back with him saying it was cute and she liked it. This broke me completely because number 1) he gave me false hope that we can work on our selves. 2) he was sleeping in the bed cuddling me and performing oral/vaginal sex with me. 3) I had a health scare and was in the hospital the week before.... I always wondered why he would put his phone away when he would come in the door. Why he would put his phone on his monitor desk while gaming when I would walk out the room. Why he was coming home late from work... I have horrible diagnosed OCD and I was going through a lot with baby. I was so on edge after finding out and still am very bad. I found out october 25th 2024. Then not even a week later after leaving hospital again I found out he was texting another girl too and claims he lied about who he actually kissed and used some random females name from work he knew to cover the female he kissed actual name. Which isn't true because when I found the female online she denied knowing him and ran from his accounts, blocked him... But he claimed yes I do know of her from work but that isn't the female I kissed nor the female  he was also texting so a THIRD female. Also he said he only wanted female friends but when we first got together he did not a great track record with those ""female"" friends. I just feel so bad because after I found out he began coddling up to me, kissing me, hugging me, saying he wanted to marry me, he wants me, he misses me... just a whole bunch of sweet sh**. We got into it again and he left me on the other side of the country he packed his things up and drove and left us to get some space which is fine we both needed it. But when asked about the females he wont tell me anything, who they are, what they look like, what they talk about . I do know they spoke about sex in the messages so there's that... He claims they would only talk about work . These females work with him so you're telling me you guys only talked about work?? While you guys would be at work and come from work you talk about work???? ok lies. He already lied about only talking to one female. I feel so hurt and betrayed. He claimed ""we aren't even together"" and he claimed he did it to upset me because he was mad at me and wanted something to rub in my face at our ""next"" argument. and he doesn't even like the female. When I found out but he literally said he wants to work on our love and that is what we were doing. I'm back in my  hometown state now. I just feel horrible and just sad especially because he did all of this while I am pregnant. I had a gut feeling a couple days before I found out that he was finding interest in someone else and I asked him if he was talking or seeing anyone else he said to me ""of course not"". I was the right the entire time... ",6,0.61,4,This-Bookkeeper8630,2024-11-13 07:20:23,1gqcpjo,10,High

NoSleep,"Growing up, we weren't allowed to look at Grandma during her 'Golden Hour'. I wish I never found out why.","At the front door Mom hesitated, drew a deep breath, and said, “Okay, has everybody still got their blindfolds?”

“Noooooo,” my brother Logan replied sarcastically. “I lost mine since you asked three seconds ago.”

Logan *hated* the safety lectures we got whenever we visited Grandma. He was thirteen and I was ten, both tall and stocky with a shock of blond hair.

Mom’s eyes narrowed at him. “Logan, how about you drop the attitude? Like I haven’t got enough on my plate already.”

“My blindfold’s right here,” I said, tapping my forehead before another argument broke out.

“Good boy Blake. We’ll be in and out in twenty minutes, I promise.”

“Then we’re getting Burger King right?”

“Absolutely,” she said with a bright smile. I punched the air while Logan muttered something too low to hear. A special treat like Burger King was a huge deal to me back then.

Our grandparents’ house lay in the centre of a dirt lot surrounded by a chain-link fence. All the curtains were taped shut. Mom rapped the door, then we waited there for a few minutes while rain hammered the gutters like a steel drum. I remember worrying we’d stand there until Grandma’s ‘golden hour’ started.

Mom grabbed a ring of keys from her bag and undid the series of locks, then we stepped into the musty air of the house, shaking water from our coats and jackets. All the tacky upholstered furniture was already outdated, even back then, and the walls were covered with shelves displaying Grandpa’s prized model car collection.

Usually, Logan and I stood on the welcome mat while Mom battened down the hatches, but past the stairs and to the left, smoke was pouring out from beneath the kitchen door. Mom rushed along the corridor into the kitchen, followed closely by Blake and I. The downstairs landing wrapped around the stairs, with the kitchen at the back of the house.

On the stove, a fry pan was spurting with giant flames as Grandma, completely unaware of the danger, tried to scramble some eggs. Mom yanked the pan off the grill just as an alarm started shrieking. She shouted for us to get Grandma out of there, waving away most of the smoke with a set of oven mitts.

Dressed in her pink nightgown, Grandma fought us every step of the way, swiping at the air with her long, yellow nails. I was afraid of using too much force because her frail body always made me picture a skeleton. In the lounge, she refused to settle on a plastic-covered sofa—everything was shrink-wrapped, really—until Logan promised he’d make her a corned beef sandwich if she behaved, speaking in the soft tones you’d use around a fussy toddler.

Shortly after the alarm quieted, Mom came in and said to Grandma, “Where’s Dad? He didn’t answer the door.”

“Eugh, don’t speak to me about that man. I was washing the dog but he kept climbing away.”

“Grandma and Grandpa got a dog?” I whispered to Logan.

“No dickhead. Grandma’s nuts, remember?”

“Logan,” Mom snapped. She *insisted* we refer to Grandma’s problems as her ‘funny spells’.

Once it became obvious nobody could coax any sense out of the old lady, Mom went to find Grandpa herself. We’d barely had time to sit when she screamed from a room upstairs. Logan and I exchanged a look of concern then rushed after her.

Grandpa was sprawled across the bathroom floor, groaning. A shower curtain which had been ripped off its hooks covered his midsection, and blood oozed from a deep gash along his forehead staining the tiled floor red. He’d slipped while climbing out of the tub. Him and Mom had endless arguments about that house being a death trap but he refused to move. He was afraid what might’ve happened if they moved someplace filled with nosey neighbours.

Mom shouted for me to call an ambulance. I rushed downstairs but the rotary phone in the landing spat a dead tone. I figured the storm knocked out the lines.

“It’s not working,” I said as I rushed back.

Mom pinched the bridge of her nose and sobbed while Logan and I stood there. Kids aren’t great at processing those sorts of situations. She told Logan to help her get Grandpa into a bathrobe hanging from a nearby rack.

“Ew, gross,” Logan sneered.

“NOW!” Mom’s sudden outburst upset me more than all the blood. She rarely raised her voice.

She told me to help with the doors. Grandpa must’ve noticed me shaking, because he forced a smile and said, “I tell you Blake, this getting old business ain’t for the faint-hearted.”

He spoke as if he’d just had five glasses of whiskey, all sluggish and lazy.

Logan and Mom helped him outside into the family Volvo, all four of us getting drenched.

“Alright, everybody in the car,” she said, panting heavily.

“I’m not leaving Helena,” Grandpa protested from the passenger seat. “She needs somebody to keep an eye on her.”

Mom’s hand shot up out of frustration. She took a moment to compose herself, checked her watch, and then said, “Okay, you boys stay here while I take Grandpa to hospital. Grandma’s gonna be fine for another three hours. I’ll be back before then, but keep your blindfolds close just in case. Logan, you’re in charge. Set your electric watch thingy for a quarter to nine so you don’t forget.”

“That’s okay, I’ll rememb—""

“JUST FUCKING DO IT,” she screamed as she climbed into the car, slamming the door shut behind her.

As we watched her drive off, I told myself there was no reason to freak out. We’d stayed with Grandma during her golden hour many times.

*Yeah, before her ‘funny spells’* a voice at the back of my mind added…

“Are we still getting Burger King?” I asked Logan after Mom’s Volvo disappeared. He rolled his eyes and spun toward the house. That stung. I was sick of him treating me like a stupid kid.

The locks were more complicated than a Rubik’s cube, so Logan needed to reseal them. As he did, Grandma hobbled out of the lounge. I met her at the doorway, but she said, “Get your hands off me pervert.”

“Gramma it’s me. Blake.”

“I’m not an invalid. Piss off before I scream.”

It hurt when she treated me like a stranger. Growing up, I’d always looked forward to seeing her. The way she’d hug me close and cover the top of my head with fierce little kisses and insist on giving me money for sweets.

Logan and I both had a go at explaining what happened, but she only tutted and said, “That man always was a drama queen.”

She went to climb the stairs, but between her stooped spine and rickety knees, the trek took five minutes. Even with our help. Anytime we steadied her she unloaded another round of insults. She disappeared into the bedroom, and then her rough, chainsaw snore rang out.

And that was that. My brother and I were stranded there without so much as a Gameboy.

In the lounge, a CRT TV received a fuzzy picture of BBC One, so we watched twenty minutes of a cooking show where celebrities crowded around a sizzling pan. With every roll of thunder, the signal temporarily turned to black-and-white fuzz.

I kept pestering Logan to play ‘the blind game’, but he insisted he was too old until a program about renovating houses started. 

The blind game was simple: somebody put their blindfold on and looked for the other while the ‘hider’ tried sneaking up on them. Usually, I hid in a storage cupboard at the back of the kitchen *just* large enough to hold me, a vacuum cleaner, and a mop, but now I was old enough and smart enough to realize it was the first place Logan checked. So, I left the door slightly open and perched myself on the closest counter instead. When he made a b-line for the nook, I leapt onto his back.

He shrugged me off, wrestled me onto the floor, and then pinched the pressure point in my shoulder, both of us laughing. After a few rounds we’d exhausted every hiding place and returned to the TV. Our stomachs wouldn’t quit grumbling. A bacon double-cheeseburger should’ve been halfway through my digestive system by then…

As time marched on, we spoke less and less. Even though the windows were blocked, I knew it was getting dark. 7.30 became 7.45. Then 8. My teeth started chattering together.

""Quit being such a pussy,"" Logan said, although I could tell he was nervous because he kept tapping his watch non-stop.

I must’ve still looked scared because he reached over and patted me on the shoulder. “Just chill. Mom’ll get back soon. Then we’ll go for Burger King.”

As if on cue, his watch beeped. Fifteen minutes to go. Swallowing a gulp, he said, “Okay, get your blindfold on.”

He helped adjust mine so everything was perfectly black, then we sat in silence while a tennis ball got batted around on TV. I’m not sure how much time passed because I didn’t want to risk peeking at the clock above the mantlepiece.

Soon the TV cut to an emergency weather report. A lady announced several major roads were closed due to flooding. My hands balled into fists. Did that mean Mom couldn’t reach us?

From above our heads, there came a heavy thud. My neck craned towards the sound. On television a crowd applauded. Logan fumbled for the remote to switch it off, then we breathed in sharply.

“What should we do?” I whispered.

“Nothing.”

“But what if Grandma’s hurt like Grandpa was?”

“Nobody’s fucking hur—”

There was another thud, loud enough to rattle fixtures around the room.

“Wait here,” Logan sighed.

When he got up, I did too—partly because I was sick of him brushing me aside, mostly because I was terrified of being left alone. I grabbed onto his t-shirt despite his protests, and then we shuffled into the chilly, draughty hall, hands fumbling across radiators, feet stamping along the floor. On our way to the stairs, Logan tried the phone but it was dead.

The noisy steps creaked beneath our feet. Still blindfolded, we reached the upper landing, and then Logan gently pushed open the bedroom door, only a slither, but wide enough that hot air blasted me in the face, warm and moist like the inside of a greenhouse.

“Grandma?” he whispered.

A chilling scream rang out which caused us to cling onto each other, then Logan’s hands fumbled over my face, checking the blindfold hadn’t slipped.

“Sorry boys,” Grandma said, laughing. “I didn’t realize you were here. Where’s your mother?”

Her voice radiated warmth now, even though she spoke through a swollen throat close to the ceiling. It had a tender quality that helped settle your nerves, even if you’d cut your finger or seen a monster in the closet. 

An enormous sense of relief washed through me. Her ‘funny spell’ had ended. She’d become lucid again.

After we explained what happened, she said, “Hmm. Well, nothing else doing but to wait the storm out I’m afraid. Have you boys had tea yet?”

We told her we hadn’t.

“Alright then let’s get you fed and watered,” she said, as she ducked beneath the doorframe.

Logan and I felt our way into the kitchen and sat around the table while cupboards swung open and shut. Soon the aroma of beef stew filled the air.

“Bon appetit,” Grandma said, setting out two bowls. “Do you know what that means Blake?”

“Good appetite.”

“Smart lad. What do you boys say to some pavlova for dessert?”

“Yes please,” I said.

“Fuck—I mean, *hell* yeah,” Logan added.

She scolded him for his language, then said, “I’ll leave you to eat in peace. Call me when you’re ready. Remember, blindfolds stay on.”

I devoured my stew without spilling much. Was I still upset about Burger King? Sure. But a stew-pavlova two-punch combo tasted almost as good. Soon our spoons dropped into the bowls, then we sat back, our bellies full.

We shouted we were done. Then we waited. And we waited. And we waited.

The legs of Logan’s chair scraped across the floor.

“Logan?” I said, anxiously.

“Chill. I’m gonna tell her we’re ready for dessert.”

He marched off down the hall, leaving me alone. It was dead quiet in the house except for the rain, thunder, and my racing thoughts. It had, easily, been five hours since Mom left—how bad was the storm anyway? Could we have been trapped there for days?

And what about Grandpa? Would he be okay?

Part of me wanted to stay there and let Logan sort things out, but I wasn’t a kid anymore. I went after him, calling as I went.

My hands ran over the side panelling along the walls, over Grandpa’s model cars. I fumbled for door handles, calling into empty room after empty room. The house felt twice as big without Logan to guide the way.

Passing the stairs the temperature shot up. On the far side, as I nudged the door into the den open, thick stuffy air seeped out, poisoning the hall.

“Logan?” I called.

Nobody answered, but as I turned away a floorboard creaked on the far side of the room. Then a voice spoke out of the darkness, all shredded and hoarse, like scud water regurgitating through a storm drain.

“My bed’s different.”

I said, “…Grandma? Is that you?”

“What are you growing corn in those ears? *Of course* it’s me. I said the bed’s different.”

There was no bed in there—only a cabinet, a rickety chair, and a sewing machine. Sweat ran down beneath the blindfold and stung my eyes. Despite the heat, I was shivering. “Grandma…is everything okay?”

“Of course it’s okay,” she snapped.

“Do you remember who I am?” I asked and I immediately wished I didn’t—as if her not answering the question kept things from being real.

“What am I, an imbecile? You’re Blake.”

My chest unclenched. Funny spell averted. I sighed and said, “Have you seen Logan? He was looking for you.”

“Who knows what that boy’s up to. Stealing probably.”

This confused me. She scolded Logan for his language a lot, sure. But he was no thief. “Uhh, anyway, I came to say we’re ready for pavlova.”

“Fine, fine. But first take that silly thing off your head and come give me a hug.”

With every passing second, the icy silence which followed became more and more unbearable. I cleared my throat. “But Grandma it’s your golden hour. We’re not supposed to.”

“Don’t be ridiculous,” she snapped, as that cruel edge seeped back into her voice. “Take that thing off and let me see your beautiful face.”

The realization hit me like a ton of bricks: she’d lapsed into another of her episodes. Desperate, I said, “Grandma I don’t think that’s a good idea. You’re…*sick*.”

“Of course I’m sick,” she snarled. “And you know what the best medicine is? A hug from my favourite grandson.”

From behind somebody burst along and fumbled around until they grabbed me by the arm.

“FUCKING RUN,” Blake shouted. He’d sensed the danger and gone the other way around the stairs to find me.

He dragged me down the hall by the arm so fast we crashed against lamps and banged our shins against side tables, knocking model cars to the ground, breaking them into a thousand pieces. At the front door, he fumbled with the locks, but they were borderline impossible even when we could see. We were like rats trapped in a maze.

“BOYS WHERE ARE YOU GOING?” Grandma screamed in a terrified voice. “DON’T LEAVE ME!”

Heavy footsteps came stomping along. Her arms must’ve been held out wide because they scraped along both sides of the wall—a distance of more than 6 ft. Logan grabbed me again and we raced into the kitchen.

He slammed the door shut and held his weight against it. “GRAB A CHAIR.”

Throughout the ground floor doors opened and shut. “WHERE DID YOU BOYS GO? COME BACK.”

I helped get a chair wedged beneath the handle just as it jiggled. 

“BOYS WHAT’S WRONG? LET ME IN!”

The door bounced once. Twice.

“QUICK,” Logan shouted.

We held our backs against the door just as Grandma struck a third time, threatening to knock us away. She alternated between mashing her fists and crying for help. I squeezed my eyes shut beneath the blindfold and prayed for Mom to come save us.

Then, everything stopped.

As we listened, the side of the door shivered open, just a crack. I sensed a finger worming through the gap, followed by a hand. Then an entire arm.

The arm probed the space directly above our heads. I crouched low, but bony fingers crawled along the top of my skull, hotter than the stove. The hand clamped shut around my head, ripping away the blindfold and singing the hair as I dropped to the floor.

Grandma hissed raw fury, then the door bounced again. Without our combined weight holding it shut, the chair gave way. The door burst open and slammed against the inside wall, knocking Logan onto the floor beside me.

I caught a glimpse of a misshapen silhouette filling the outer hall, but at the last second shielded my eyes from the glow.

Logan picked me up.

“My blindfold,” I whimpered. In a flash, he wrestled his own over my eyes.

“HUG TIME,” the creature on the far side of the room snarled, the heat surging around us.

Logan shielded my body with his own, ready to make his last stand, but I shouted, “The compartment.”

We sprinted toward the tiny nook, me first, then Logan tried squeezing in after. I tossed the vacuum and mop away and then made myself as small as possible. He wedged himself inside and pulled the door as far as it could go. Neither of us had space to breathe but for a moment I thought we’d be safe in there.

But then two long arms invaded the space.

“COME TO GRANNNNNYYYYY.”

Logan started sliding away. I found his hands and held on with all my strength, but Grandma was too strong. My big brother, my protector, got reeled away like a fish on a line.

He screamed, but not for long, because that scream became a dry croak as his throat closed over. I wanted to help, but I couldn’t bring myself to move. So, I yanked the door shut and held my breath. Soon I couldn’t hear anything except the harsh thud of blood in my ears.

It wasn’t long before Logan’s watch beeped again, signalling the end of Grandma’s golden hour. I didn’t budge a single inch. Not even when Mom’s car pulled up outside. Or when she entered the house. Or when she found out what happened and started screaming…

**--**

A few days later, I was helping Grandpa out of the car. His head was encased in a thick bandage. I helped him over to the house while Mom unlocked the door.

In the den, Grandma was raving about invisible chickens. Logan was there too, sitting on an armchair. I asked if he wanted to play the blind man’s game but his eyes stayed locked on the new Gameboy Mom bought for him.

Mom got Grandpa settled then made lasagne which everyone ate except Grandma, who complained it tasted worse than fried dog shit. Afterwards, Logan asked if we were gonna stick around, but Mom said she needed to get me home because I had homework to finish. That wasn’t true, and I think he knew this.

The *real* reason was because it was already 8.45, which meant Logan and Grandma’s golden hour was about to [start](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)…",489,0.98,16,lightingnations,2024-11-13 08:53:46,1gqen62,505,High
NoSleep,I wish I never waved to the man who watched me…,"Every evening at precisely 10:00 p.m., the man appeared in the window across from mine.

I first noticed him on a foggy October night. I was pacing around my tiny apartment, trying to work out a problem for a client, when my gaze wandered to the old building across the street. Through the dim haze, I could just make out a figure, barely visible, framed in the dusty glass of an upstairs window.

At first, I thought nothing of it. He was probably just a neighbor, taking a quick look outside. But the next night, at exactly 10:00 p.m., there he was again, standing in that same spot, staring into the street. Something about the way he stood made my skin crawl. His face was barely visible, shrouded in shadow, but I could make out the pale outline of his eyes. He was watching me.

I closed the blinds that night, uneasy. But every evening after that, no matter how hard I tried to ignore him, I felt his presence. Curiosity—or perhaps a growing sense of dread—got the better of me. Each night, I would watch the clock, my heart pounding, until the hour struck ten.

And there he would be.

Days turned into weeks, and the man never missed a night. Always standing in the same spot, in the same eerie, unbroken silence. He never waved, never moved, just watched, as though waiting for something.

One night, I decided to wave to him. I wanted to see if he’d respond. As soon as the clock hit ten, I pulled back the blinds and raised my hand, hesitantly, toward the window.

His eyes met mine, and for a brief moment, I thought he was going to lift his own hand. Instead, his lips curled into a small, unsettling smile, revealing darkened, uneven teeth. My skin prickled. I quickly closed the blinds, trying to shake off the creeping chill that had settled over me.

That was the first night I heard him.

I had just started drifting off to sleep when a faint tapping echoed through my apartment. My eyes snapped open, heart hammering. The tapping was steady, deliberate, like someone lightly rapping their knuckles against glass. I lay frozen, listening, trying to place the sound.

Tap… tap… tap…

It was coming from my window.

Slowly, dreading what I might see, I turned toward it. Through the thin fabric of my blinds, I could make out a shadowy outline standing on the fire escape outside my apartment. A face pressed close to the glass, a wide, toothy smile just barely visible through the slats.

My blood ran cold.

I wanted to scream, but I was paralyzed. I squeezed my eyes shut, hoping it was just my imagination, that the man in the window was only a trick of the light, a shadow cast by passing cars.

The tapping grew louder, more insistent.

Tap… tap… tap…

Somehow, I managed to bolt upright, grabbing my phone and dialling 911 with trembling fingers. The dispatcher answered, her voice a steady anchor in the dark. I whispered, terrified he might hear me, that there was someone on my fire escape.

Within minutes, I heard the wail of sirens. I didn’t dare open my eyes until I felt the reassuring presence of the police officers. They searched the fire escape, the alley, the entire building, but found nothing. No footprints, no fingerprints, nothing to indicate anyone had been there at all.

The officer suggested it was just a nightmare, a figment of my imagination. But I knew what I’d seen. I could still feel the weight of his gaze, the pressure of his face pressed against my window.

That night, I barely slept, the man’s smile haunting my every thought.

The next day, I tried to convince myself it was over, that he wouldn’t return. But as the clock struck ten, I found myself unable to resist looking out the window.

He was there, staring back at me from across the street. This time, he looked different. His face was somehow clearer, his features sharper, more defined. His eyes were glassy and dull, his skin pale and stretched tight over his bones. And there was something else. He was holding up a piece of paper against the glass.

It was a small, yellowed scrap, crinkled around the edges. I squinted, trying to read the faint, scrawled words.

“I’m watching.”

I stumbled back, heart racing. But when I looked again, the note was gone. The man was gone. The window across the street was empty, as though he had never been there at all.

For days, I waited, dreading the hour of ten o’clock. The silence gnawed at me, filling my mind with dread. But after a week, when he didn’t reappear, I began to hope that maybe it was over.

One night, weeks later, I was drifting off to sleep when a loud knock jolted me awake. I froze, straining my ears, praying I’d imagined it.

Knock… knock… knock…

The sound was coming from my front door.

My heart raced as I forced myself to get up, creeping slowly toward the door. As I got closer, I could hear something—a faint, rasping whisper, barely audible through the thick wood.

“Let me in.”

The whisper was dry, hollow, like dead leaves scraping against pavement. I backed away, shaking. I turned on every light in my apartment, trying to drown out the darkness, the growing terror that filled me.

The knocking continued, steady, rhythmic, unyielding.

“Let me in.”

Desperate, I dialed the police again, but by the time they arrived, the knocking had stopped. The officers looked at me with pity, clearly doubting my story. They left soon after, telling me to call if I had any more “trouble.”

For hours, I sat in silence, barely breathing, waiting for the knocking to start again.

But it didn’t. I never heard it again.

A few days later, I noticed the building across the street was empty. No lights, no movement. It was as though the place had been abandoned. Curious—and maybe a little desperate for closure—I went over to ask around, hoping to learn something about the man in the window.

The landlord, an elderly woman, looked at me with wide eyes when I mentioned him.

“No one’s lived there for months,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “The last tenant… well, he disappeared. The police never found him. The only thing they found in the apartment was a note left on his window. It said, ‘I’m watching.’”

Her words chilled me to the core. That night, as I lay in bed, I realized something.

I could still feel his eyes on me, watching from somewhere unseen, waiting for the moment I’d let him in.

NoSleep,My Dead Wife’s Cat Knows Too Much,"It’s been four months since she died, but I still wake up every morning with the same image: her standing in our kitchen, making tea. She almost always had coffee in the morning, so it was odd enough that I noticed. I was sitting at the table, half-awake, just watching her hum along to some song I didn’t recognize as sunlight filtered through the window. She looked up, caught me staring, and laughed.

“See you later, alligator,” she said, with that little smirk I loved, and leaned down to brush a kiss against my cheek.

The memory feels like it’s been carved into me, sharp as a knife, catching in my chest every time I breathe. I never saw her again. A few hours later, while I was at work, her car collided head-on with a drunk driver. He died instantly, but she held on for a few minutes. I don’t know exactly what happened in those final moments, but the paramedics said she was trapped—broken and alone in that twisted mess of metal.

She tried to call me. I know that because when I finally checked my phone, there was a missed call. I’d left my phone on silent, buried in my pocket while I sat through some mind-numbing meeting, completely oblivious. I wasn’t there for her. I missed her call.

Since then, I can’t shake this obsession. Every night when I close my eyes, I imagine what she would have said if I’d answered. Would she have called my name? Would she have told me she loved me, or would she have begged me to help her? Every possible answer just… eats at me. It’s like that missed call is stuck in my mind, a voice I can’t escape, dragging me down into something so dark I’m not sure I’ll ever climb back out.

When her funeral finally came, I barely remember it. Everything felt like a blur—faces, voices, people patting my shoulder. Friends told me I looked like a ghost, just staring blankly at her casket, not really seeing anything. I was gone too. Whatever part of me was left was buried with her that day.

I thought I would eventually find a way to keep going, but I haven’t. I can’t. Our apartment is exactly as she left it. Her clothes are still in the closet, her toothbrush next to mine, her favorite mug sitting by the sink. I’ve left everything untouched, like she’s going to walk through the door any second. I can even still smell her faintly on the sheets. Every time I’m home, I feel her lingering, just out of reach.

And then there’s her cat, Milo. He was never really mine. She had rescued him from a shelter years ago. He was this scrappy, one-eyed thing, and she used to call him a survivor, like he’d been through hell and back before she found him. He was her shadow, curling up on her lap, always ignoring me. But now, he won’t leave me alone. It’s like he’s watching me constantly, following me from room to room, his one good eye tracking every move. Sometimes I catch him staring at the wall, his gaze so focused, so intense, like he’s watching something only he can see. It gives me this weird chill, like she’s there, watching me through him somehow.

Or maybe I’m just losing it.

About a month after the funeral, I decided—well, tried—to sort through her things. Everyone said it would help me “move on,” whatever that means. But it was like every item was a piece of her, some shard of our life together, and I couldn't let go of a single thing. I was sitting on the floor with her sketchbooks, trying to tell myself I’d just look through them, maybe find a few to keep, when I noticed something strange.

There, buried under a pile of her old notebooks, was a small journal. I recognized it immediately. She used to keep it by the bed, jotting down little notes or random sketches before she’d fall asleep. But when I flipped it open, something caught my eye. It was a note—her handwriting, but… dated two days after her death.

I thought it had to be a mistake, that I was reading it wrong. But her handwriting was unmistakable. I read the note, once, twice, then a third time, the words hammering into my mind, stranger each time:

*“Love, I don’t have much time. I know you’re hurting, and I’m sorry. But please, don’t let me go. I’m here, somewhere dark, somewhere terrible. And I need you. There’s a way to bring me back. I know you can do it. Just don’t forget me. I’ll guide you. Trust me.”*

Her handwriting was a mess, like she’d written it in a rush. The letters were shaky, slanted. It didn’t make sense—none of it did. She’d been dead for days by the date on that note, and yet… I was staring at her handwriting, feeling her voice in my mind, hearing her words as clear as if she were there beside me.

I tried to tell myself it was impossible. Grief does things to people, right? They see signs, they hear voices, they try to hold on to anything that keeps the person they lost close. But this didn’t feel like some illusion my mind was conjuring up. It felt real. Tangible. I read that note a dozen times, each line sending chills through me, deeper each time. I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was right there with me, close enough to touch.

Then, two nights later, I got an email.

It was from her account. I’d left it open on my computer because… well, I couldn’t bring myself to close it. Seeing her name there in my inbox was a way to hold on, a way to keep her close, even if it was just digital traces. But that night, her name popped up with a new message. The subject line just read, “I’m still here.”

I stared at the screen, my heart pounding. My first thought was that it had to be a glitch. Or maybe someone was playing some sick joke, hacking her account to mess with me. But when I opened the email, the message was a garbled mess, full of typos and half-finished sentences that didn’t make sense. Still, her voice was so clear in my mind as I read it.

*“It’s dark here. So dark. I don’t know how long I can hold on. Please, you have to help me. Find something of mine, something precious. Bring me back. I’m waiting.”*

It felt like the air had been sucked from the room, like my chest was about to cave in. I should have told myself it was some kind of trick, maybe some spam or error. But it sounded like her, the way she’d phrase things, the way she’d talk to me. Who would go through the trouble of faking that? And why?

I closed my laptop, tried to delete the email, but my hands were shaking too much. I found myself reading it over and over again, her words burrowing into my brain, filling me with this desperate, aching need to bring her back. Because what if she was there? What if she was trapped somewhere, waiting for me? If there was even a tiny chance… how could I ignore that?

I went to bed that night feeling like I was half in a dream, her voice echoing in my mind. And when I closed my eyes, I swear I felt her, like a faint warmth beside me, almost like the weight of her body lying next to mine. Even Milo was acting strange, sitting at the edge of the bed, staring at some empty space in the room with that one intense, unblinking eye.

The email was just the beginning.

After that first email, the messages didn’t stop. They’d come at random times—early in the morning, late at night—just a few lines, sometimes a single, desperate sentence. They were all from her account, and every message was more frantic than the last. Each one painted a picture of… well, of somewhere horrible.

One night, I found a note folded up in her favorite book on the shelf. I hadn’t touched it since she died, hadn’t even opened it. But there it was, right there on a slip of paper that looked fresh, like someone had just put it there.

*“Please, don’t let me fade. It’s endless here, just darkness and pain. I can feel myself slipping. I know it’s hard, but there’s a way—a ritual. It’s the only way I can be free.”*

I read the note again and again, my hands going numb. Her handwriting was there, clear as day, even down to the little flourish she’d put at the end of her letters. It was her. And the words… they were different from her usual tone—almost frantic, like she was trapped somewhere, fighting to stay connected to this world.

I wanted to tell myself that I was going crazy, that maybe I’d written it myself and forgotten, or maybe I was imagining things because of the grief. But the details—the little things that only she would say, the way she’d phrase things, her shorthand—it was all too familiar.

Then, a few nights later, another email arrived. This time, there were no words, just an image attached. My hands shook as I clicked on it, half-expecting something terrifying, but it was just a photo of her and Milo from last year, sitting on the couch, her hand resting on his head. I hadn’t taken that picture; she’d sent it to me one day while I was at work.

Below the photo was a single line of text: *“I’m so cold, love. So cold. I need you to help me.”*

By now, my nights were haunted by her presence. It was subtle at first—a faint hint of her perfume lingering in the air, the quiet creak of the floorboards in our room as if she were moving around. Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I’d feel a warmth beside me, like she was lying next to me, her arm draped over me the way she used to do when she was still alive.

Milo would sit at the foot of the bed, his gaze fixed on something I couldn’t see. His one yellow eye would follow whatever it was around the room, and every so often, he’d make a low, almost guttural sound that sent a shiver down my spine. I felt her there with us—so close I could almost hear her breathing.

The next message came the following evening, slipped beneath a photograph on our dresser. I hadn’t moved that picture in months; it was one of us on a hike, taken the summer before. And there, on another piece of paper, her handwriting stared back at me:

*“Gather something of mine—my ring, a lock of hair, anything with my essence. Place them together. I’ll tell you the rest soon.”*

The message ended there, but I didn’t need any more. I found myself nodding, barely thinking as I opened the drawer beside the bed, pulling out her favorite necklace, a hairbrush with a few strands of her hair still tangled in it. I gathered the items slowly, with a kind of reverence, feeling like each piece was a tiny fragment of her, a part of her spirit waiting to come back.

I laid everything out on the table, my hands shaking. I could feel her so clearly, like she was just inches away, urging me forward. There was something powerful building inside me, a need to complete whatever she was asking, to bring her back, no matter what it took.

And then, just as I was beginning to feel some kind of twisted hope, the final email came through.

The instructions were clear, but there was one thing she was asking for that sent a chill straight through my core:

*“A vessel,”* she wrote, *“young and pure, a soul untouched. The younger, the better.”*

I recoiled, my mind racing, that one word echoing in my head. But even as I felt the horror of what she was asking, her emails kept coming, each one a desperate plea, reminding me of the darkness she was trapped in, the suffering she was enduring.

*“I know it’s hard, love, but you’re the only one who can help me. Don’t let me suffer alone. Please, hurry.”*

I shut off the laptop, my hands trembling. I tried to sleep that night, but every time I closed my eyes, I saw her face, twisted in agony, reaching out to me, begging me to free her.

And I knew, in that moment, that if I had to go through with it… I would.

For days, I tried to push her last message out of my mind. I wandered the apartment, staring at the things I’d gathered for the ritual, trying to convince myself I’d misunderstood. But the emails kept coming, each one more frantic, more desperate. Her words were filled with a kind of agony I’d never heard from her before, descriptions of a place I couldn’t even imagine.

*“It’s like fire, but deeper. There’s no end here, no light, just… emptiness. Please, love, I can’t do this alone.”*

I felt her slipping away, each message more frantic, like she was running out of time. And every time I hesitated, every time I tried to push it out of my mind, I felt her presence fade a little more. I began to avoid being home, haunted by her voice, the weight of her request. I wandered the streets late at night, letting the exhaustion numb my thoughts, anything to escape the pressure of her words.

One evening, on one of those late-night walks, I saw her—the little girl next door. She was playing alone in her front yard, a small ring of wildflowers in her hair, twirling around in the grass with the carefree innocence of childhood. She laughed, a soft, bright sound that made my heart ache.

I turned to leave, to go back inside, but then her laughter drifted through the air, sweet and clear, a reminder of everything I’d lost. I could feel her—the woman I loved—her presence growing weaker with each passing second, her voice becoming an echo. And as I stood there, caught between the fading memory of her and the vibrant life in front of me, the emails echoed in my mind, those last desperate words she’d written:

*“The younger, the better. You’re the only one who can save me.”*

The girl looked up, catching my gaze, and gave me a small, innocent wave. She trusted me; she’d seen me her whole life, watched me talk to her parents, helped me feed Milo once when we were out of town. I was just a friendly face, the nice neighbor from next door. As she looked at me with a smile, I could feel something inside me shift, my grief and desperation twisting into a dark, singular need.

Before I even realized what I was doing, I’d taken a step toward her. The words came out in a quiet, steady voice, like they belonged to someone else.

“Would you like to come meet Milo?”

Her face lit up, and she nodded eagerly, skipping over to me with a trust that nearly shattered me. But by now, I was too far gone, my mind filled with her voice, urging me on, pleading with me to save her.

As I led her inside, the apartment felt darker, heavier, like it was holding its breath. The items I’d gathered for the ritual lay arranged in a careful circle on the floor, each one glinting softly in the dim light. Milo sat at the edge of the circle, his one yellow eye fixed on me, unblinking, as if he could see the weight of what I was about to do.

I led the girl to the center of the circle, her small hands still clutching a stuffed animal, her eyes wide and curious as she looked around. Her innocence felt like a knife in my chest, a part of me screaming to stop, to turn back. But then, I felt it—her presence, my wife’s spirit, so close I could almost feel her hand on my shoulder.

“Are we going to play a game?” the girl asked, her voice trembling slightly, a hint of nervousness in her smile.

“Yes,” I whispered, barely able to speak. “A very special game. But you have to be very quiet.”

She nodded, trusting me completely, and that trust burned through me like acid. But I couldn’t stop. Not now. I took the shoelace I’d prepared, my hands trembling as I looped it around her small neck as gently as I could, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst.

Her eyes widened in fear, her small hands reaching up to grasp mine, her voice barely a whisper as she realized what was happening. “Please… please don’t.”

In that moment, something inside me broke. I felt my heart splinter, but I told myself this was for her—for the woman I loved. Her letters, her voice, they were all I had left, and they’d pushed me this far. I tightened the shoelace, feeling her struggles grow weaker, her breaths shallow and desperate, until finally… silence.

I let go, stumbling back, staring at her still form in the center of the circle, her wide, lifeless eyes staring back at me, frozen in terror. The room felt suffocating, the weight of what I’d done crashing over me like a wave. But I reminded myself it was worth it. This was for her.

I waited, barely breathing, my hands shaking as I watched the circle, expecting something—anything—to happen. I could still feel her presence, stronger than ever, just out of reach, waiting to cross over.

Any moment now…

I waited in that dark, suffocating silence for hours. My eyes never left the circle, the little girl’s body lying still, her eyes wide and empty, staring up at nothing. I whispered her name—my wife’s name—again and again, as if calling out would somehow bring her closer, pull her across whatever barrier separated us.

But nothing happened.

The air felt thick, heavy, pressing down on me from all sides. I was frozen there, watching, waiting, the quiet so absolute it felt like it was choking me. I told myself to be patient, that the ritual must take time, that she was adjusting, coming back slowly. But as dawn began to creep through the windows, casting pale light over the room, a creeping sense of dread began to coil in my stomach.

Something was wrong.

The girl’s body hadn’t moved, hadn’t changed in any way. Her eyes were still open, her small mouth slightly parted, frozen in an expression of horror and betrayal. I reached out, my fingers trembling as they hovered over her, searching for any sign of life, of her presence, of… anything. But there was nothing. Just the cold, lifeless body of a child.

And then the smell began.

It was faint at first, just a hint of something off, something wrong. But as the hours passed, it grew stronger, filling the room with a thick, sickly odor that clung to everything. I tried to ignore it, to tell myself it was just part of the process, but the smell became unbearable, a constant, nauseating reminder of what I had done.

Days passed, each one stretching on endlessly as I clung to the hope that she would return. I kept the girl’s body hidden, wrapping it in plastic and shoving it into the bathroom, desperately trying to contain the smell, but nothing helped. I’d wake up in the middle of the night, gagging on the stench, feeling her presence fading more and more with each passing day.

Finally, on the fifth day, reality started to sink in, cold and cruel. She wasn’t coming back. The ritual had failed, and I was left with nothing but the rotting remains of an innocent child. My mind reeled, spiraling with the horror of it, the enormity of what I had done crashing over me, suffocating me.

With numb, trembling hands, I gathered every plastic container I could find, trying to erase the evidence of my crime, to bury the nightmare that had become my reality. I sawed through the small, broken body, each movement mechanical, my mind blank as I forced myself to go through with it. The sounds were unbearable—the snap of bones, the wet, sickening give of flesh—and each cut felt like it was tearing through my own soul.

There was one moment that will haunt me forever. Her head wouldn’t fit into the container, and in a blind, frenzied panic, I found myself slamming it against the edge of the tub, my hands slick and shaking, my stomach twisting as the sound echoed through the empty apartment.

Once I’d packed everything away, I drove far out of town, taking the containers to an abandoned factory on the outskirts. The silence of the night was thick, oppressive, pressing down on me as I dug a shallow grave, covering each container with dirt, my heart pounding with the sick, twisted hope that maybe, just maybe, burying the evidence would bury the memories too.

But as I stood there in the dark, staring down at the freshly turned earth, I knew—deep down—that nothing would ever bury what I’d done. This was my reality now, a weight that would follow me to the end of my days, a stain that would never wash away.

I drove back to the apartment, numb and hollow, every room filled with the shadow of her absence. Milo was waiting for me, his one yellow eye glinting in the dim light as he watched me with a strange, unblinking intensity, like he knew. I could barely look at him, the weight of my guilt pressing down on me, crushing me under its weight.

That night, I sat alone in the darkness, the silence suffocating, pressing down on me like the walls were closing in. And then, in that endless, empty quiet, my phone buzzed.

An email.

The sender was unknown, the subject line blank. My hands shook as I opened it, my breath catching in my chest as I read the words on the screen.

*“Did you really think she was waiting for you? Did you really believe? She’s gone. There’s nothing left for you now. Only darkness.”*

And below that, a name. Her name.

It felt like the world had tilted, the horror of it sinking in slowly, like ice creeping through my veins. I’d been deceived. Manipulated. Whatever had been sending those messages, those letters… it wasn’t her. It had never been her.

I stared at the screen, the words blurring as tears filled my eyes. She was gone—truly gone—and I was left with nothing but the weight of what I had done, an act so monstrous that I knew, in that moment, there would be no redemption. No forgiveness.

Only darkness.

Milo watched from his usual spot, his gaze unblinking, almost… pitying. I looked into his eye, and for a fleeting moment, I could almost see her, her face, her smile, all the moments we’d shared. It was a painful, gut-wrenching image, gone as quickly as it came, leaving me with nothing but the crushing reality of what I’d become.

In the silence that followed, a strange calm washed over me. I knew what I had to do. There was no forgiveness for what I’d done, no undoing the horror I’d committed. The only way out was one final, irreversible act.

I walked to the bedroom, my footsteps echoing in the silence, each one heavy with the weight of my decision. I reached for the gun I’d bought weeks before, the cold metal a final comfort, a dark promise that would end the suffering that had consumed me. I held it in my hand, feeling its weight, the barrel gleaming in the dim light, a promise of release.

I sat down on the bed, Milo curling up beside me, his presence a strange comfort in those last moments.",32,0.88,3,SpecificCrash,2024-11-13 17:47:56,1gqr9la,35,High
NoSleep,"There's a framed family photo wall in my home. Recently, I noticed a new one of a complete stranger.","My name is Nick Bannon. I’m about six feet tall. Skinny build. My curly hair and eyebrows are a dark brown, and my eyes are bright blue. A strange start to my story, I know, but it’s only because I know the inevitable. It’s going to happen again. I don’t know where, and I don’t know who to, but I have a feeling it’s been happening for a while. I’m just another small link in a long, long chain.



If there’s a photo in your home that matches the description above, you’re in danger. All I can advise is that you get out. Get out as fast as you can and share my story with somebody, anybody who will believe you. I’ve written it out below, as quickly as I could under the circumstances. I don’t think I have much longer. It’s going to find me soon.



————————————————————



My Mother died two months ago. Lung cancer. We weren’t very close, especially at the end, but I’d been the only family she didn’t despise. Because of this, the majority of her possessions were left to me. This included an old blue truck, a storage unit full of tattered furniture and old clothes, and a split level house at the end of a long country road.



The house itself was in okay shape. There were some exterior walls that looked a bit rough, but it was old. Good bones, as they say. I decided I’d move into it, at least for the time being. I was between jobs, and it felt like as good a place as any to crash for a little bit. I packed what few belongings I had from my shitty studio apartment and left the city in my rearview mirror.



Things were normal for the first few days. It felt good to be away from the chaos that I’d grown accustomed to. My closest neighbor was two miles away, and I barely saw any cars drive by. I’d forgotten the value of silence from time to time. 



However, pretty quickly it got to the point where it was too silent. Soon, every creak made me jump, every gust of wind sounded like an intruder, and it was driving me crazy. I decided that I needed a project. Something to fill the silence. Pass the time. I had a lot of it these days. I looked around at all of Mom’s tacky inspirational wall hangings and her dated velvet furniture and decided that it felt too much like her in there. If I was going to live there, I was going to make it mine.



I had a yard sale that had a pretty great turnout, despite my isolated location. Pretty much everything went, and what didn’t get sold got donated to a local thrift store. I shampooed the carpet, painted the walls, tended to the garden, all things that Mom probably hadn’t done in years. By the time I was finished, the entire house almost looked brand new. I bought some new furniture with the yard sale money, threw up a few horror movie posters, and soon enough this place was starting to feel like mine. 



————————————————————



It had been easy to get rid of Mom’s stuff because, quite frankly, most of it had been ugly. The only things that stuck around were her framed portraits, the ones that climbed the stairs. They were family photos. A dozen semi-familiar faces dotted them sporadically, and I found myself staring at them from time to time, wondering what they were up to now. It felt odd. I’d been alone for so long that the thought of a family this big being *my* family didn’t make sense in my head. 



I started getting in the habit of greeting them each morning. I know, it sounds weird, but grief is a strange thing. I felt comfort in it. As I’d been clearing out everything, I’d found a family photo album. Using that, I’d been able to match a lot of the names to faces. Aunt Grace popped up a lot throughout the frames, as did my Uncle Rob. I even saw myself as a baby a few times. It took a while, but soon I had each of them memorized. That’s why I’d noticed the new photo almost instantly.



Every single one of the frames had a thick, black frame, no matter the photo size. It gave the wall a nice, uniform look. Mother had liked them that way. The new one stood out from the rest. It was made up of plastic roses, each one a different shade of red.



The image inside of the roses was of a woman. She was ice skating alone on some pond, surrounded by brush and thick snow. The photo was taken from a few yards away, through the branches of a dead tree. It was like photographer had been crouching a few yards away. Hiding. 



When I went to take the frame off the wall, I was met with…wetness. The entire frame was covered in some sort of thick, clear goo that had started to pool on the stairs. My stomach churned at the sight of it. I took my shirt off and used it as a sort of glove to carry it to my kitchen table.



I stared at it for a long time. Half of my brain was searching my early memories for the skating woman. Maybe she was a long lost relative, or maybe a friend of Mother’s? But that wouldn’t explain the photo showing up out of nowhere. I’d passed that photo wall dozens of times, and I was almost certain that it hadn’t been there before. It also wouldn’t explain that disgusting goo.



At that point, I was weirded out and confused, but I wasn’t scared. I’d heard about strange things happening in the woods, how it can play tricks on your mind. That had to be it. I tossed the frame into the garbage. I didn’t want it anywhere near me. I thought that’d be the end of it. Just a strange occurrence, nothing more.



That morning, I skipped saying hello to the photos. There was an imposter. It didn’t feel right.



————————————————————



Later that day I decided to take the truck into town and run a few errands I was putting off. I needed to get out of the house. It felt like I had that disgusting goo all over me, even after a shower. Being in town helped a little bit, but not much. At the convenience store, the cashier picked up on my off mood.



“You doin’ okay, sweetie? You look pale.” She said, bagging my groceries. I lied and told her I was fine, and forced our conversation to turn towards the weather.



“I’m just getting sick of those storms,” I said. “I know some people say they help them sleep, but not me”



The woman gave me a weird look. “Storms? What storms? It’s been bone dry for weeks! You sure you’re okay?”



“Oh, uh…yeah. Yeah, I’m fine.” I stammered, grabbing my groceries. I hurried out of there and got in the truck. What had she meant by no storms? I’d been seeing lightning every night pretty much since I’d moved in. Maybe she lived in a different county. Yes. That had to be it. 



I drove around for an hour or two before heading back. The skating woman wouldn’t leave my head. When I finally returned to the house, it had started to get dark. Night time out in the middle of nowhere was no joke. I brought the groceries in and put them away. I cooked a small chicken dinner, cleaned the dishes, and shut the house down for the night. I needed to sleep. It wasn’t until I went to shut off the front porch lights that I noticed it.



The photo of that skater. It was back in its place on the wall, right along with the others. A fresh layer of goo was dripping off of it like slimy teardrops.



*Alright,* I thought. *Now I’m scared.*



————————————————————



I didn’t end up getting much sleep that night. I laid in bed and stared at the ceiling in a daze. The sounds of the old house sounded even louder in the dark. There wasn’t a storm, at least not one that I noticed. In the morning, I checked every single nook and cranny in this house, looking for any sort of explanation on who’d moved the photo while I’d been gone. It had to be an intruder, but there were no signs of forced entry. The windows had been rusted shut years ago, so there was no chance of someone shimmying in that way. All of the doors had been locked as well. Deadbolted.



Outside, I saw no footprints or tire marks that weren’t the truck’s. Nobody else was here but me, at least according to the physical evidence. After a paranoid few hours of searching, I got fed up. I started a fire in the backyard and threw the photo into it. It almost sounded like it was screaming as it went up in smoke. I stood there until I was sure it was charred beyond repair before I doused the flame.



The next day I had someone from SPC Security come out and installed a home alarm system, complete with a tablet that controlled its every move. It was very fancy. The man showed me how to arm and disarm the system, and helped me create an access code. After he left I felt a bit better. At least now I’d know if something in the house was moving while I wasn’t.



The photo hadn’t returned, thank god, but I still felt weird about the photo wall. What had once given me comfort now felt wrong. I took the photos down and put them in a box that I shoved into a closet. The stairwell looked bare afterwards, like I’d ripped all of its teeth out, but I felt good. It felt like I had things under control.



That night, I got into bed with the security tablet laying on my bedside table. I armed the house with my access code, and I drifted off to sleep as the lightning began once more.



————————————————————



The alarm clock read 3:45 a.m when I was startled awake. There was a sound.



*ACK! ACK!*



I squinted through the pitch black, still half asleep. I couldn’t see anything.



*ACK! BLECH! ACK!*



Whatever it was was loud. Really loud. The sound was like a blend of a sick puking cat and a human cough. I rubbed my eyes with some force and peered into the darkness again.



*ACK! ACK! ACK!*



As my eyes began to adjust, I saw it. In the corner. Something was there. Crouching. Vibrating. Twitching. It was hard to make out its shape in the dark. It looked human. At least, it was big enough to be one. The only thing I could see was a tiny red light, right where its eye should be.



Terror had stapled me to the bed. Every fiber of my being wanted to tear out of there, but that…that *thing* was right by the bedroom door.



*ACK!*



This time it was louder. I saw it wretch over, like it’d been punched in the stomach. It smacked its lips as its shoulders twitched back and forth with the sound of crunching, shifting bones.



I noticed the security tablet sitting next to me. Earlier, the guy had said that if I hit the side button three times, the police would automatically be called. It was about a foot away from my reach. Moving as slow as I could manage, I stretched my arm across the bed. My fingers grazed the edge of the screen. I pressed down and started to drag it towards me, but instead of falling onto the bed, it fell onto the floor with a soft clunk.



The shape in the corner jumped up onto its feet with a sharp, guttural inhale. It looked over at me. I made eye contact with its…its eye light. We were both still for a moment, studying each other, until it darted from the room and out into the hallway. I heard a faint *ACK* before the ear-piercing alarm began to go off. It must have moved enough to trigger it.



With tears in my eyes, I reached down to the tablet and shakily clicked the side button three times.



————————————————————



I waited out by the road for the cops. The further from the house, the better. Whatever…*it* was, it was still in there.



Since I lived so far from town, it took longer for the local sheriff to reach me. I’d started to shiver by the time I saw the lights through the trees. This town was small enough to only have a sheriff and a deputy, and they’d both shown up for my call.



“So you saw an intruder in the house?” The sheriff asked. He seemed doubtful. Nothing of that sort happened out here in the sticks. I was sure these guys had never dealt with any *real* crime.



“Yes. I think it’s…he’s still in there. Upstairs.”



The sheriff went inside to look around while the deputy surveyed the property. I remained in my spot by the mailbox. I probably looked crazy, standing out there alone in nothing but my boxers, but I didn’t care. My heart hadn’t stopped its incessant beating, and a cold sweat had formed on my brow. I was just focused on not passing out in front of these cops.



After what felt like years, the sheriff exited the house and met back up with his partner. They exchanged a few words I couldn’t hear before coming to join me again by the road.



The sheriff spoke first. “The house is clear, sir. I looked everywhere, checked all the windows, everything. No signs of forced entry.”



“I didn’t saw nothin’ neither, “ the deputy tacked on. “I checked e’rywhere. No footprints, nuthin’. It’s just you here, sir.”



I couldn’t believe my ears. I wanted to force them back inside, make them check again, make them see what I saw. But I saw that look in the sheriff’s eye. Concern mixed with secondhand embarrassment. Here I was, a paranoid guy in his underwear, lamenting about an intruder in his isolated house. If I kept it up, they might just take me back to the tiny station downtown.



I decided to lie. “I’m embarrassed, officers. I apologize. My Mom died recently, and I just…I must be seeing things. I’m exhausted.” 



The officers looked at me, then at each other. The deputy took a step forward and put a hand on my bare shoulder.



“It’s all good, boy. You’s Mom was a town gem. Everyone loved her. We did at the station, too. She had her fair share of calls down to the station. Was never anything, though. Seems like the apple don’t fall far from the tree, right sheriff?”



The sheriff was not as polite as his deputy. “Get back inside and get some sleep. It looks like you need it. Goodnight, son. Sorry for your loss.”



I waved goodbye with a still-shaking hand as they turned around in my driveway. On their way out, the detective slowed to a stop right by me. He held a flyer out the window.



“Hey. I promised the family I’d hand these to everyone I came across. Keep an eye out, will ya?”



They drove away and disappeared into the trees. I unfolded the flyer. It was a missing poster. There was a thick block of text above a photo.



MISSING: JULIA HELMS

AGE: 32

LAST SEEN: NEAR COPPERHEAD WOODS

ANY INFORMATION SHOULD BE REPORTED TO 1-555-685-0928



I recognized the face in the photo. I’d watched it burn in my fire pit earlier that day.



————————————————————



Mother’s house had become a threat. I couldn’t sleep. I could barely eat. I stopped opening the windows in the morning and mainlined coffee to stay awake. I patrolled the house with a hammer in one hand and a baseball bat in the other. Overkill, I know, but what else could I do? 



After some digging online, I found an article about the missing woman. Julia Helms. According to the Slow Turtle Gazette, she owned a local hobby store called Sew Chic, and had been an avid ice skater. Just last year she’d won a national title. In the attached photos, she was smiling the same way she’d been on my wall. I began to see that face everywhere, especially when I shut my eyes. It was etched into everything.



I was in a strange position. What was I going to do, go down to the station and tell those cops that something was living in my house? That it was leaving pictures of a missing woman on my walls? They’d definitely take me in then, especially considering my little stunt the other night. I didn’t even have the damn photo anymore. Even if I did, having a previously unseen photo of a woman the day she went missing wasn’t a good look. 



That wasn’t all. There was something else that I kept coming back to, something that I just couldn’t let go of. The angle. The way the photographer had been hiding. Waiting. It did the same in my home for three days before it showed up again.



————————————————————



I’d gone to the shop again that morning for food. Julia’s missing posters were taped on every light pole in town. I tried not to look at them, but I still saw her in my periphery. That smile kept passing me at 30 miles per hour, punching me in the gut each time. Mindful of the groceries in the bed of the truck, I slowly upped my speed until I was back in the thick forest. Nobody bothered with the posters out here.



As I approached the house, I noticed something in the front yard. Little bits of white were strewn across my front lawn, like confetti. I parked the truck and approached my porch with extreme caution. The little pieces were everywhere. I picked one up and held it up close, making eye contact with half of my Aunt Grace’s smiling face.



Mother’s photos, once the heart of the house, had been torn to pieces and cast out carelessly on the grass. Some pieces got caught in the wind and blew up and out into the trees.



The inside of the house was trashed. It was like a tornado had come through and destroyed everything in its path. The fridge had been ransacked, and food was thrown on the walls and smeared onto the windows. Furniture was upside down, pillows were ripped open and gutted. There was also the goo coating the floor, making it slippery. It was like the trail a snail leaves behind. I tried not to vomit as I made my way through the first floor, a butter knife clasped in my shaking hand. Don’t laugh. It was the only weapon I could find on short notice.



In the hall closet, the box that I’d put the family photos in was shredded. I checked to see if any survived the carnage, but there weren’t any. That thing had taken each of the photos out of the frames and destroyed them. I couldn’t figure out why, though. What did it want with the frames?



A sound upstairs caught my attention. *ACK! ACK!* *CLUNK!* I rounded the corner just in time to see something tumble down the stairs. It was the security tablet. Shattered. I picked it up, wincing as a piece of broken glass got shoved into my thumb.



ACK! It coughed again, closer this time. It was coming from the top of the steps now. I dropped the tablet onto the ground where it landed with a splash in a pile of goo. There, at the top of the stairs, I saw it. It was shrouded in the darkness of the upstairs hallway, but it was there. I saw its skinny, vibrating body. I saw its bright red eye. I saw…I saw…



The photo wall. It was back. The frames were hanging again, although crooked. All twenty-four of them were there. They covered in a dripping mess that ran down the wall in thick ropes. Now, though, instead of the smiling faces of my family, all I saw looking back at me was…me. They were all photos of me. Sleeping. In each one, the flash was bright enough to wash my skin out.



I remembered those nights. All that lightning.



*BLACH! ECK! ACK!*



It held up its bony hand to block the sun from its eye. There was something embedded in his palm, a sort of…glass ball. It glistened in the light. 



*ACK!*



The glass bulb in its palm was inches from my nose. I heard nothing besides the sound of a small whirring, like something winding up. It was the last thing I heard before I was blinded.



————————————————————



I’m not too sure how to describe this next part. It’s going to sound crazy, but it’s the stone cold truth. The thing in its hand…I guess you could say it’s a camera. Or, maybe it itself is a camera. I still don’t really know for sure. When I came to, the thing had started shaking. It held onto the railing for support as it jerked from left to right, sending dribbles of its spit all over the entry way.



I’d backed myself into the corner of the room, as far away as I could get. My head was pounding. Terrified, I crossed my arms and folded my legs up into my chest. I wanted to make myself as small as possible. I wanted it all to be over. I wanted my Mother.



*ACK! ACK!*



Through my shaking fingers, I watched the thing stumble its way down the final few steps on all fours. It was still coughing, arching its back like a sick cat with each heave. After a few heavy purges of goo, I saw something fall out of its throat and onto my carpet. It was a photo. It was *my* photo. My horrified face took up the entire page.



The thing grabbed the paper from the ground and flattened it. It looked at me with that bright eye for a few moments before reaching over and tossing it in my lap. I noticed what looked to be a smile creep up on its thin lips. It seemed proud of its work.



Before I could even think about my next move, I swung the butterknife. It landed with a dull thunk somewhere on the side of its thick head. An inhuman wail spilled from its wet mouth as it backed into the wall with force. The crash rattled some of the photos of my sleeping body tumbling off the wall. I snuck past the thing as it tugged at the knife handle in its face, taking the steps two at a time.



An armoire that my Mother had bought ages ago still stood in her old craft room upstairs. It was big enough for me to just barely fit inside. I climbed in and shut the doors quietly. 



I’ve been in here ever since.



————————————————————



Like I said at the top, there isn’t much time for me. There aren’t a lot of hiding places in this house. It’s sure to pull open the armoire doors at some point in time. What happens to me then I’m not sure. Perhaps I’ll face the same fate as Julia Helms. Perhaps I’ll find a way to escape, although that seems doubtful.



There’s a crack in the door of the armoire. As I’ve been writing, I’ve peered through it and witnessed that thing pass through this room a few times. Each time, it brings one of the frames from the wall and adds it to a line it started on the floor. It’s laying each one out. At first I wasn’t sure what it was up to, but I think I know now.



I remember Julia’s photo. The frame of roses that it lived in.  I think that thing forced her to choose a frame for her photo, and now it was setting me up to do the same. Not that I’d have much choice. Mother had liked the uniform black, after all.



Please, please remember. My name is Nick Bannon. I’m about six feet tall. Skinny build. My curly hair and eyebrows are a dark brown, and my eyes are bright blue. If you see me in your home, in a thick, black frame…be cautious. Tell mine and Julia’s stories. And if this thing comes for you next, I hope you can kill it. 



I only wounded it, it seems.

NoSleep,Ghosts in the Water: Tales from the SAR Diver’s Depths,"The city sprawled out beneath me like an ever-changing mural as I perched in the open door of the rescue helicopter, one leg inside, the other teasingly suspended over the edge. The colors of the landscape shimmered in vibrant greens, blues, yellows, and browns, each hue laced with the melancholy rhythm of Kordhell's ""Murder on My Mind,"" which pulsed through my earbuds. Technically, this was against regulations, but after twelve grueling hours of relentless hurricane cleanup, I felt justified in bending the rules a little. This work, though fulfilling, often felt like a marathon without end—an unyielding series of intense runs where the only certainty was fatigue.

In the world of Search and Rescue (SAR), most people associate the acronym with heroism and life-saving. But for me and my fellow 'angels of death,' the R stands for something far more somber: recovery. As an open water, wreck-trained diver—often referred to as a 'hard hat' due to the helmet I wear while diving—my role unfolds in the aftermath of tragedy. When nature’s ferocity renders hope untenable, and recovery becomes the morose necessity, it's my team they call upon to perform the somber task of reclaiming the lives lost beneath the waves. The hurricane that had ravaged the coast left a familiar, mournful imprint on my heart, pulling me back into the fray for yet another solemn mission.

Today's deployment had me working alongside military personnel, a stark reminder of the seriousness of our task. I could feel the vibrations of the Seahawk beneath me as we navigated toward the reported location of a capsized yacht. It was a familiar scene—a rescue call with no signs of life, the Coast Guard helpless as they arrived to find the vessel turned turtle, swallowed by the sea. My heart raced at the thought; third or maybe fourth task of the day, and we were faced with treacherous waters still churning from the hurricane's wrath. As the helicopter slowed near the last known position, I felt a gentle tap on my shoulder; the loadmaster signaled five minutes out. Time to suit up.

Anticipation quickened my movements as I assembled my gear, knowing that the minutes to come would test both my skill and resolve. Poised in the doorway, the world below transformed from a vibrant panorama to an abyssal mystery. It was time to leap into the unknown, and as I relinquished my hold on the bird, I held my breath, surrendering to the weightlessness of the drop before I plunged into the water's embrace. In that fleeting moment, darkness enveloped me, but as my helmet illuminated the surroundings, I quickly regained my focus on the task at hand. The depths beckoned, and as my eyes adjusted, I caught glimpses of the wreck—a twisted remnant of human ambition now languishing at an angle on a muddy outcropping. Time was of the essence; I sensed the urgent decay of the vessel's resting place, urging me to act swiftly before nature reclaimed what tragedy had taken.

I quickly kicked my fins, swimming down to the wreck, sliding in along its keel first and catching glimpses of the gleaming propellers and stern before finally slipping under the murky depths. The once-grand yacht lay sprawled across the ocean floor, a memorial to a sudden, violent end. Almost immediately, I found the first body— a young man, no older than twenty-five, his face frozen in an expression of abject shock. The sight sent a chill down my spine. Yeah, buddy… I thought, sudden death is truly shocking. It’s an ending you never see coming. Recovery was methodical; I gently pulled him from the wreckage, carefully untangling him from the anchor rope that had tethered him to the abyss. Attaching a lifting bag to his ankle, I hit it with a small blast of compressed air, watching him rocket skyward as I steeled myself for deeper exploration.

Venturing further into the wreck, I scanned the darkened interiors, knowing that what was once a luxurious vessel was now a tomb—a costly reef drowning in tragedy. The galley was eerily still, remnants of a life well-lived now shrouded in silence. As I slipped deeper into the cavernous space, I was met with an unexpected noise. It was faint but distinct: a tapping, rhythmic and deliberate. Underwater, sounds travel well; I could hear the muted thwop of helicopter blades overhead and the creaking of the wreck as it settled further into the seabed. Yet this persistent tapping was something entirely different. Could it be a sign of life? I recalled stories of survivors trapped in air pockets, and a surge of determination propelled me forward.

Navigating past empty staterooms, I almost jumped when I collided with another body. This one was a cook, I surmised, though the bloated figure was unrecognizable in the eerie green haze surrounding him. An unsettling revelation washed over me; underwater, blood turned a vivid green. With swift urgency, I floated him upward, knowing that time was precious. The tapping grew louder as I navigated the confines of the luxurious yet ghostly wreck. A creeping unease settled over me—something wasn't right. Each passing moment heightened my awareness. Why were there so few bodies? The yacht, magnificent in its prime, now held haunting echoes of its former glory. The engine room was conspicuously empty, and the odd placement of doors and lights seemed too intentional. The deeper I delved, the more I noticed inconsistencies.

That’s when it struck me—the engine was a facade, a carefully crafted illusion that left me bewildered. Here I was, trapped in this elaborate set piece, and my instincts screamed at me that there was a danger lurking behind those twisted designs. The atmosphere thickened as I began to turn back, the sense of foreboding pressing heavily on my chest. As I retraced my path, panic set in; I couldn't quite remember the way. The familiar confines of the wreck transformed into a labyrinth. Alien shapes danced in the shadows, and I noticed the darkness creeping closer as I struggled upward, gasping for air. Thrumming in my chest was a primal instinct to survive. Kicking harder than ever, the surface felt so far away, an unreachable beacon. Just as darkness began to close in on me, icy fingers gripped at my limbs, pulling me back into the depths. Desperate, I fought against unseen forces, only to notice a flicker of hope as another diver appeared, offering the promise of fresh oxygen.

When I broke through the surface at last, gasping for air, the weather had calmed, but the turmoil inside me remained. Exhausted and bewildered, I was hoisted onto the rescue boat. It was only then, amidst the fresh air and gently bobbing waves, that I began to comprehend the sheer magnitude of what I had encountered. I had been down there for nearly an hour—longer than I’d intended. The relief on the faces of the rescue team was palpable, but my mind raced with questions. What had I found? Why were there so few souls in that wreckage? The looming prospect of a pressure chamber awaited me, but deep down, I knew that I hadn’t just been on a routine dive. I had brushed against the strange and the mysterious, and the answers were still hiding beneath those dark waves.

Those answers never would come. When I was released with a clean bill of health, my superiors came to find me.  They informed me, in what i'd call a pretty terse attitude, that going forward, I wasn't to talk about the incident. As far as anyone was concerned, it simply hadn't happened. I started to protest, but it was clear. No one wanted to talk about this.  Whatever that was, it was well above my paygrade to understand.  If I kept asking... I wouldn't be diving long.  That didn't stop me from looking, of course, but I did so on my time.  I turned up some records online. Stories similar to mine. Divers finding these strange wrecks in places they simply shouldn't be. Strange tapping, incomprehensible ship layout, and too few victims.  In most every case, one or more of the divers that found them, vanished. Claimed by the depths.  As I sit here writing this, I'm reminded of a saying. ""We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.""  I think Lovecraft wasn't far off, his words a reminder of the perilous boundaries we tread upon when seeking knowledge shrouded in darkness. The sea holds its secrets tightly, and perhaps it is better to let the mysterious silence remain undisturbed; sometimes, ignorance truly is bliss.",22,1.0,1,kibufox,2024-11-13 17:46:01,1gqr7zc,23,High
NoSleep,I should've never opened the box in the attic. It still haunts me to his day!,"The first time I set foot in the old house, I felt an inexplicable shiver, like an unseen gaze was fixed on me. My parents said it was just the chill of an empty house, but something else felt… off. It was a grand, old Victorian manor, with narrow staircases, tall windows, and a silence that settled thickly in every corner, as if the house itself was holding its breath. My parents couldn’t believe their luck finding a place like this for such a low price. “It has character,” they said. “It’s charming.”

But I could feel that weight, an unspoken presence that seemed to linger just beyond sight.

It wasn’t long before we’d unpacked the ground floor and our bedrooms, but the attic was left for last. From the moment we moved in, I was drawn to it, though I couldn’t say why. Maybe it was the idea of the unknown, of the forgotten things stashed up there by the previous owners. My parents warned me to be careful on the stairs; they were narrow and steep, twisting up to the attic like they were designed to keep people away.

One chilly afternoon, while my parents were out running errands, I finally decided to explore the attic on my own. I climbed the narrow stairs, the wood creaking under my weight, and slowly opened the attic door.

The air was stale, thick with the smell of dust and decay, and the shadows seemed deeper, more oppressive than the rest of the house. Faint shafts of light filtered through a tiny window, casting long shadows over old trunks and covered furniture. The silence felt alive, thick and heavy, like it was listening. And then, nestled in the far corner, I saw it.

The box was small but ornate, covered in carvings that seemed to writhe under the dust, as if they were alive. Strange symbols, almost like twisted vines, wove across its surface, and though I’d never seen markings like these before, they looked disturbingly familiar, like something I’d glimpsed in a half-remembered dream. The wood was dark, stained, almost black, with a faint reddish sheen that reminded me of dried blood.

I stepped closer, feeling an odd compulsion to touch it, to know what secrets it held. As I approached, the air around me grew colder, as if the box itself was pulling the warmth from the room. My skin prickled, a tingling that grew sharper with each step. Every instinct told me to leave, to shut the door and go back downstairs, but I couldn’t look away. My hand moved almost on its own, reaching out, fingertips brushing the carved lid.

A wave of dread washed over me as I lifted it open, a feeling so intense it took my breath away. Inside, lying on a bed of faded, ancient fabric, was a mirror. It was small, maybe the size of my hand, and framed in tarnished brass with the same twisting patterns carved along the edges. But it was the glass itself that held my attention. Even through the dust, I could see that it wasn’t just a reflection. It seemed deeper, like I was looking into an endless void, a space that could swallow me whole.

I stared at my reflection, feeling an odd, uncomfortable pull, like something in that mirror wanted to reach out, to wrap itself around me and pull me inside. My fingers tingled where they touched the edges of the mirror, and the air grew thick, pressing in on me until I felt I couldn’t breathe. I set the mirror back down, closed the box, and stepped back, a shiver crawling down my spine.

The attic was colder now, silent except for a faint creak, like something shifting in the darkness. I backed away, my heart racing, and stumbled down the stairs, forcing myself to put as much distance as I could between me and that box. I told myself it was just an old relic, something left behind by the previous owners, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d woken something up, something that had been waiting.

That night, as I lay in bed, I heard it—the faintest scratching sound, almost too quiet to be real. I held my breath, straining to hear, and after a moment, it stopped. I convinced myself it was nothing, but when I drifted off to sleep, I was haunted by dreams of shadows crawling along the walls, of cold hands reaching out to touch me, to drag me back to the attic.

I woke up with a start, feeling eyes on me, but the room was empty, the shadows still. Just as I was drifting back to sleep, I caught a glimpse of something in the corner of my room. There, half-buried in the shadows, was the box from the attic. My blood went cold. I knew I hadn’t brought it down. Heart pounding, I reached out, fingers trembling, and pulled it toward me.

The mirror was there again, its surface dark and bottomless. As I picked it up, I saw my face reflected in the glass—my own features twisted, stretched, as if something was looking back at me from beneath my own skin. And then, behind me in the mirror, I saw a figure—a tall, dark shape, its face obscured but its eyes bright, piercing. I spun around, but my room was empty. When I looked back at the mirror, the figure was gone, but I could still feel it, watching me.

The following days were a blur of shadows and whispers. Every night, the scratching grew louder, and the figure became clearer in the mirror. It no longer hid in the shadows; it stood right behind me, close enough that I could feel the cold radiating from its body. I couldn’t escape it. It was there when I closed my eyes, when I looked into any reflective surface, waiting for me to turn my back.

One night, when the scratching was so loud I could barely think, I went back up to the attic, carrying the mirror with me, determined to put it back where I found it. But as soon as I set it down, I heard a whisper, soft and mocking, right in my ear.

“You can’t hide from me,” it said, the voice low and gravelly, like two stones grinding together.

I stumbled back, heart racing, but the voice followed me. Shadows shifted around the box, twisting into shapes—faces, bodies, hands reaching out. I scrambled down the stairs, locking myself in my room, but the voice was still there, a soft humming that grew louder and louder until it was all I could hear.

From that moment on, the entity was with me, an unshakable presence haunting my every step. I’d see it in reflections, lurking at the edge of my vision, always watching. I began to lose sleep, the whispers and scratching invading my dreams until I was afraid to close my eyes. My parents still didn’t believe me, and I was too scared to press the issue. They didn’t hear it. They didn’t see it.

But I did. And I knew, deep down, that it wasn’t going to stop.

One night, in a moment of desperation, I went back to the attic, hoping to destroy the mirror, to break whatever curse I’d awakened. I smashed the mirror to the floor, shards scattering across the room. For a moment, the scratching stopped, the whispers fell silent, and I felt a sense of relief.

Then, slowly, the shards began to shift, pulling together, forming into a shape. The shadows coalesced, rising from the fragments, tall and impossibly thin, its eyes like burning coals. It smiled at me, a grotesque, mocking grin, and I felt a cold hand press against my shoulder.

“You can’t get rid of me,” it whispered, voice filling my head. “I’m part of you now.”

I screamed, stumbling back, but it followed me, its face twisted into that terrible smile. And that’s when I knew—I would never be alone again. It had claimed me, and there was no escaping it.

After that night, I tried to go back to normal. I went through the motions—school, conversations with my parents, pretending. But I could feel it there, a dark presence lurking just behind my thoughts, watching, waiting.

At first, it was subtle. Shadows moved differently around me, my reflection seemed to hold something deeper, something… gleeful. I’d find myself staring into mirrors too long, studying my own face like it was a stranger’s. The scratching sounds never left, now echoing from within, scraping at my mind until I was awake, alone in the dark.

Over time, the whispers started, twisting my thoughts, making people look like shadows in masks, urging me toward things I would never have done. Sometimes I’d feel myself let go, letting it take over just to ease the pressure, feeling that dark satisfaction flood me until I was sickened by what I’d become.

Each day, I feel it grow stronger, its desires becoming mine. I don’t know where I end and it begins. I know now that there’s no escape; it’s part of me, a silent, laughing passenger, twisting my thoughts, consuming me piece by piece.

I am no longer alone... No.. [WE](https://youtu.be/km2ujccVh6w) are no longer alone.",78,0.93,1,DivineAnime1,2024-11-13 08:18:42,1gqdw8p,79,High
NoSleep,"If you happen to get contacted by 'yourself', please, do not respond","Whatever that thing is, I believe it just wants what you have, it wants to exist, but it has one major problem: it either does not have any identity or it is unaware of its own, therefore, it feels the need to assume yours. A typical freaking parasite.

It does not matter which medium it uses. It can strike anywhere, anytime and anyhow, therefore, to help you with awareness and prevention, here are some of the methods I have witnessed it use: a prepaid call or sms coming from your own number and on your own mobile phone or landline, a video or audio call or message or post coming from your own profile regardless of the social media application used (even this one), a call on the intercom of your own apartment, an email from your own email address, a letter mysteriously delivered at your address with your own name as the expeditor, and even mail pigeons landing near your windows with rolled papers around their necks. I believe that the last method, even though rare, proves the antiquity of that entity AND PLEASE, if you intend to upvote, downvote or comment on this post, verify and ensure that the poster is NOT your own username.

There is no concrete profile that can be established when it comes to its victims, as it does not discriminate between you or your 9 year old little brother or daughter with a cellphone or tablet. Once it targets you, it contacts you, and if it gets your response, you disappear within a certain amount of time, never to be seen again.

How do you know all that? You might be wondering. Look, I want you to know that I am not very proud of what I am about to reveal concerning myself. Know that out there, some people with tremendous financial means, influence and power, do not have your best interest at heart, if they have one that is. Unfortunately, I happened to work for them at some point in my life and witnessed the extent of cruelty they are willing to reach in the name of progress, so please understand that I cannot mention names. Among the many atrocities they managed to lay their hands on, is that entity they chose to name Kevin, a name it never responded to. Like I mentioned earlier, it seems to lack any identity of its own, and does not have any appearance whatsoever until it assumes the one of its most recent victim for a period of 34 minutes at most.

Since I never worked on the field, I have no idea how those evil people keep track of that thing, after deliberately releasing it out there for their 'research' purposes, but I chose to risk my safety if it can save at least one life, even just one. I made that decision the day I saw that report. There is one report of an analysis, video call hacked and included, that I will never erase from my mind. 

On a Saturday afternoon, while at work, an innocent mom of two received a video call from 'herself' that she unfortunately picked up. The guys from the IT had hacked her phone screen and her front camera, thus allowing us to see the concerned look on the innocent mother's face. The phone screen was entirely black until she said the usual 'hallo' thus providing the entity with what it always seeks, a response. At that moment, the sound came on, and movements could be observed from the screen as if the caller was walking. Soon, voices of an adult woman greeting people, a teenage boy asking his mom where her car was and an enthusiastic young girl, followed. After a few seconds, the entity revealed itself as her doppelganger, standing in front of her house, smiling maliciously to the camera, with her own kids playing in the background. Crushed with terror, fear and disbelief, the mother muttered a simple 'who' unable to complete her question, before screaming the name of her children in an indescribable distress and in vain. Her car was later found abandoned in the middle of a road leading to her address with no trace of her, as the last clues she left behind were frantic calls to one of her neighbors, her son and the police. No strange call was found in any history on her phone, probably erased by the IT guys or the entity itself.

Even those evil people are not immune to that strange being, and to be honest with you, neither them nor myself know of any defensive mean against that entity in case of even an involuntary response. Prevention is the only way I know to avoid its deadly grasp. I sometimes hear knocks on my front door at various times of random days, and since it has already proved that it is not bound to electronics, I avoid any verbal response and simply open the door. Often, it is really a human being, a delivery person, an acquaintance, a family member, or a friend, but sometimes, there is nobody at the door, or maybe nobody that I can see.",5,0.86,0,AngelmZeal1,2024-11-13 20:18:25,1gqucq4,5,High
NoSleep,"They never listen. They never believe. But I'll keep trying, because that's all I can do. That's all I've ever been able to do.","I've been working in this textile factory for forty years now. I've seen them come and go - both the living and the dead. When Sarah walked in that morning, bright-eyed and full of hope, my heart sank. They always look like that at first. They never listen. They never believe. Something about her reminded me of myself, decades ago, before I learned the true nature of this place.

The memories flood back whenever a new face appears. Emily in '92 - she had that same determined walk, head held high despite the whispers from the old-timers. She lasted three weeks before the cutting machine claimed her. Maria in '98 - her laugh could light up the whole floor, until the day she answered a call for help that came from no living throat. And then there was Kate in '03, Lisa in '07, Amanda in '12... The list grows longer every year, and I force myself to remember each name, each face, each story. Someone has to carry their memories.

I watched Sarah fill out her paperwork, her hand steady and sure. If only she knew what those forms really meant - not just employment agreements, but potential obituaries waiting to be written.

The factory hasn't changed much since I started here in 1985. The same industrial lights flicker overhead, casting long shadows between the rows of machinery. The air still carries that distinct mix of cotton fibers and machine oil. But now it carries something else too - whispers, echoes, and the lingering presence of those who never left.

I remember my first day like it was yesterday. Margaret, the floor supervisor then, had given me the same tour I now give to others. She'd seemed distracted that day, her eyes constantly darting to empty corners of the room. I understand now what she was seeing. She didn't make it to retirement - lost to the cutting machine in '93. Sometimes I still hear her counting inventory in the storage room.

I try to warn them all, in my own way. During Sarah's lunch break, I pulled her aside. My hands were shaking - they always do now, after what I've seen. ""There are things you need to know about this place,"" I told her, watching her young face for any sign of understanding.

""When you hear someone asking for help with their machine, don't go. Never go alone. Always verify with at least two other people that someone needs help. The voices... they're not always who they claim to be.""

I remember giving the same warning to Jennifer in '05. She laughed it off. Three days later, we found her by the spinning wheel. The ghost that called her had worn my voice.

Sarah nodded politely, but I could see the skepticism in her eyes. They all have that look at first - that mixture of concern and pity for the old woman who's spent too many years among the machines. Some think I've inhaled too much cotton dust. Others assume the isolation has gotten to me. If only it were that simple.

Back in '97, I tried to document everything. I kept detailed records of every incident, every pattern I noticed. The way the machines would run at slightly different speeds just before someone died. The cold spots that would appear in new places. The voices that sounded just a little too perfect, too familiar. Management found my notebooks during a routine locker inspection. They sent me to three different psychiatrists. I learned to keep my observations to myself after that.

I watched Sarah during her first week, noting how quickly she picked up the work. She had good instincts around the machines, respected their power. But she was also kind - too kind. When Lucy from packaging called out sick, Sarah volunteered to cover part of her shift. She didn't know that Lucy had died in '01, and sometimes her ghost still punches in for the night shift.

I was in the break room when it happened. My sandwich sat untouched as I heard the commotion - running footsteps, a machine's terrible grinding, then silence. I knew before I even got up. They'd used my voice again.

I ran to the spinning room, my arthritis forgotten in the moment. But I was too late. I'm always too late. The spinning wheel was still humming, threads tangled in impossible ways. Sarah's body lay motionless beside it, her hand still reaching out to where she thought I had been standing, asking for help with a jammed mechanism.

The worst part is always the aftermath. The police investigations, the safety inspections, the grief counselors. They never find anything wrong with the machines. They never question why it's always the same machines, the same circumstances. The reports always read ""operator error"" or ""failure to follow safety protocols."" But how do you report that a ghost asked for help? How do you explain that the voice calling out in distress wasn't human at all?

Sometimes I wonder if I'm part of the curse too. Doomed to watch, to warn, but never to save. Forty years of the same story, different faces. The ghosts never take me - perhaps that's my real punishment.

The next morning, I stood in my usual spot, watching them cover Sarah's body. The machines hummed their eternal song, and I could already see her ghost forming in the corners of my vision - another shadow among shadows, another voice that would call out for help.

In Forty years, I've learned to recognize the different types of ghost-shine. The fresh ones glow brighter, still clinging to their last moments. Sarah's had that same desperate gleam I've seen too many times before. They all start the same way - confused, angry, desperate to understand what happened. Some fade with time, becoming mere whispers in the darkness. Others grow stronger, learning to mimic voices, to manipulate the machines.

I returned to my station, as I always do. The only living soul among the machines and their ghostly operators. Sometimes, in the quiet moments between shifts, I catch glimpses of all of them - Emily, Maria, Jennifer, and now Sarah. They watch me with hollow eyes, perhaps wondering why I survived while they didn't.

There was a time, years ago, when I tried to quit. I made it as far as the parking lot before the weight of responsibility pulled me back. Who would warn the new ones if I left? Who would remember their names, their stories? Who would know to look for the signs, to question the familiar voices calling out in the night shift? So I stayed, becoming as much a fixture of this place as the ghosts themselves.

Tomorrow, someone new will walk through those doors. And I'll try again, knowing it probably won't make a difference. Because that's my curse - to keep trying, to keep warning, to keep remembering. It's the least I can do for all the souls trapped in this place of endless shifts and eternal overtime.

The factory stands as it always has, a monument to progress and productivity, its windows gleaming in the morning sun. But I know its true nature now. It's not just a factory - it's a gathering place for the lost, a repository of voices that never quite fade away. And I remain its sole living witness, keeper of its dark secrets, guardian of its growing collection of shadows.

As the afternoon shift begins, I hear Sarah's voice for the first time since her death, calling out from near the spinning wheel. It's perfect, too perfect, just like all the others. I close my eyes and whisper a quiet prayer for whoever walks through those doors tomorrow. They never listen. They never believe. But I'll keep trying, because that's all I can do. That's all I've ever been able to do.",581,0.98,19,newbieyeye63,2024-11-12 16:33:40,1gpxk8l,600,High
NoSleep,After The Midnight Bus,"I never thought I'd be the kinda person to work a crazy graveyard shift at some gas station out in the middle of nowhere, but here I am, saying yes to Mr. Reilly like it’s just normal. “Yeah, no big deal,” I told him, “I can handle the late shift.” Back then, I’d get all shaky just thinkin’ about bein’ somewhere so quiet, alone with my own head. But now, it feels like the only peace I got.

Ain’t no customers past eleven, just the occasional trucker or someone lost who needs directions back to the highway. So, it's mostly just me, my homework, and my headphones. Got a little playlist goin’—old songs, stuff I saved back when I thought music was gonna be my thing. Little reminders of what I left behind. I keep the volume low enough to hear the bell on the door in case someone walks in, but it’s loud enough to drown out the creaks of the building.

Night shifts are quiet. Real quiet. Crazy quiet sometimes. Just me, sittin’ under the buzzing lights, eyes on my notes but feelin' like someone’s watchin’ me, even though I know they ain’t. The only visitors are the lights flickerin’ outside, or maybe the moths hittin’ the glass.

When the clock hit midnight, I let out a long breath, relief rushing in as I flipped the “Closed” sign and locked the door. Quiet night, nothing strange—just me, my textbooks, and a half-awake delivery truck driver who came in for a pack of cigarettes and two energy drinks, mumbling somethin’ crazy about a long haul ahead.

Outside, the bus was waitin’ at the stop, headlights dim like it’s tired, just sittin' there. I walked over, keys diggin' into my bag, and climbed on, hit with that usual smell—mildew, body odor, and old puke. It’s like that every time, the bus smell, mixed with cleaner that never really does the job.

The driver nodded when I sat in my usual seat by the window. The bus lurched forward, pulling away from the stop, and the world outside turned into streaks of dark trees and dim streetlights. Every now and then, the bus hit a bump, and I’d jerk in my seat, my headphones sliding off. But I kept the music low, just enough to fill the silence, watchin’ the world slip by in the dark, with that weird, crazy smell stickin’ to me the whole ride.

The bus felt heavy with quiet as I blinked myself awake, eyes slow to adjust to the dim lights. I looked out the window, expecting to see the usual blur of passing streets, but instead, there was just a big, cracked lot, all foggy. A sign barely showed in the mist—Park and Ride. No cars. No other buses. Just the fog, curling around weeds growing through the cracked concrete, and a couple of busted lampposts throwin’ weak lights that flickered in the gloom.

I pulled off my headphones and let them hang around my neck, the silence now thick as I heard every little sound. I called out, “Hello?” but my voice just bounced back at me, dead in the air.

I stood up, walking down the aisle, my steps too loud in the quiet, headin’ toward the driver’s seat. It was empty. His jacket was hangin' on the back like he’d just stepped away, but the doors were locked. My skin started crawlin’, like somethin’ wasn’t right.

I pulled out my phone, tried turning it on—blank screen. Dead. My stomach twisted, but I noticed a charger coiled by the driver’s seat. I plugged it in, thankful it fit, and a tiny red light blinked on. A bit of relief washed over me. It’d take a few minutes to power up, but at least it was somethin’.

I slumped into the driver’s seat, staring out at the fog, the shadows dancin’ around the lights as I waited. The minutes dragged on, the silence wrapping around me like the mist.

As I sat there, I started feelin' that loneliness creep in, mixing with the anxiety that’d gnaw'd at me since the second I stepped on this bus. My fingers drummed on the armrest, the tapping sound too loud in the silence, makin’ everything worse. I tried to focus on the faint glow of my phone charging, but my mind kept wanderin’ to the fog outside, wonderin’ what might be out there watchin’ me.

I stared at the red light flickering on my phone, willing it to hurry up. My stomach was tight, my mind all over the place. The phone finally powered up, and I wasted no time, dialing my brother. It rang and rang, but he didn’t pick up. I called again, my finger pressing the button harder, like that’d make him answer. Nothin’.

I sat there staring at the screen, feeling the quiet close in around me. I didn’t know who else to call. Maybe Mr. Reilly? But I didn’t want to bother him, especially this late. He’d probably tell me to suck it up and handle it myself. I thought about calling a cab, but that wasn’t gonna work. I had no money for that. No way to get out of here unless someone came for me.

I kept thinking the bus driver would come back any second. Maybe he just stepped off for a minute, right? But the minutes stretched on, one after another, dragging until I started feeling some kind of trapped feeling. I tried not to think about it. But every time I heard a sound, I looked up, expectin’ to see him walk through the door. And every time, it was nothing.

Then the lights flickered once. And again. Then, just like that, they went out. The whole bus was crazy dark, except for the dim glow from the charger, now barely visible. My breath hitched, and I shivered, pulling my jacket tighter around me. The air felt colder all of a sudden, like the temperature dropped ten degrees in a blink.

I glanced at my phone—1:00 AM. The silence was thick, pressing in from all sides. No driver. No lights. Just me, sitting in this cold, empty bus with nothing but my own thoughts.

I shook my head, trying to push away the creeping feeling that something wasn’t right. I thought about waiting longer. Maybe he was just messing with me, right? Maybe he was gonna come back, tell me it’s all fine, and we’d just go on like normal. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that the longer I stayed here, the worse it was gonna get.

I pulled my legs up to my chest and wrapped my arms around them. The fog outside pressed up against the windows, like it was tryin’ to swallow the whole bus. I wanted to call someone. Anyone. But I didn’t know who. There was nobody else. Just me, the dead phone, and the fog.

The sound of something outside the bus made me sit up and look around out the windows. I couldn't see nothing until I saw this guy come running up alongside the bus. He looked like a homeless person, and his eyes were crazy scared, and I got scared.

I don't panic well, and I just sat there staring at him while he hit and kicked the door and yelled at me to let him in. Even if I wasn't too scared to move out the seat, or wanted to let him in, I didn't know how to unlock those doors and let him in. They open automatically when the bus isn't moving, and I had no idea how to turn on the bus or open the doors.

He was out there jumpin' around acting all crazy when he suddenly stopped and looked at something emerging from the fog. His back was to me, and I couldn't see his face, but he was pushin' himself against the bus like he was trying to fade through the door to the safety inside, or something.

I followed the direction he was looking, and at first, it was just this blurry shape, like a big white trashbag rolling along the ground or something. For about half a second, then I could see it too, and it is hard to remember. It was like something out of a horror movie, or something, it didn't look real to me. I could hear a loud shriek that wouldn't stop and realized I was screaming.

I covered my eyes, the vision of that thing crawling on all fours coming towards us on my eyelids. I could still see it, somehow clearer when I had my hands over my eyes. It was moving almost sideways, coming at him low on the ground. It was like a person, except with its arms too long and skinny and its legs bent all wrong, like it could only crawl along like that. The fog was a clean white color, and its skin was a sickly, almost gray color, and its face was just a weird-shaped head with no eyes or ears or nose or lips or hair, just this huge white football head and a huge mouth full of human teeth.

The man outside was screaming in pain and terror and I refused to look. The creature, the gray crawler, was biting him. I glanced a couple of times and only saw a blur of movement, and it scuttled all over him, biting chunks out of him. Then, after what seemed like an endless amount of violence and screaming, his flailing was striking the bus over and over in loud thumps - the guy collapsed to the ground, twitching. The creature let out a sound like a pinched version of a dinosaur roaring.

I had lowered my shaking hands from my face and somehow they had found my headphones and were playin' some of my music in my ears. I have no idea I did that, but as I watched I was hearing my music, and my trembling hands were checking my body for damage, feeling a chill from my own fingers.

Several more of the creatures arrived and they made weird deep throated gurgling and clicking noises at each other. I think they were talking to each other. They each grabbed one of his arms or legs and worked together to drag him away.

He started moaning in pain as they took him into the fog, and I sobbed and shook my head. It was so horrible, he was still alive as they took him away. I was crying as I sat there.

Just then my phone started ringing and I jumped up, letting out some kind of startled noise, almost like I was barking. I was so terrified I was ready to drop kick my own phone for scaring me.

""Emily you alright, baby?"" It was my brother. He'd woke up and checked his missed calls from me.

""I'm at the park and ride. Some guy just got killed."" My voice was high and whispery, and full of dread. He couldn't understand me, and I had to repeat myself over and over until he did.

""I'm coming to get you. I got your location. Stay where you are, and call the police."" Zaire said. He had to hang up to use the locator app, but told me to call him while he was on the way if I need to.

""Just hurry."" I told him. He told me he loved me and he would be there in about twenty minutes. It was a forty-minute drive, apparently, so I told him to drive safely.

I looked up and thought I saw movement outside and I got down between the seats and hid. After awhile, listening and terrified, my heartbeat audible in my ears, I looked up out the window, staring wide eyes out into the night and the fog out there.

Slowly lowering myself back down I got my phone and dialed 9-1-1. The operator asked me the bus number and I didn't know how to check that, so she directed me to the front of the bus, where a vehicle identification number would be too small to read. There, in the corner, there was a bus operation designation. I told her I was on bus eight-sixteen.

""Officers are on the way. Stay hidden."" The operator told me. I thought she would stay on the phone with me, but we got disconnected somehow.

I looked and saw I really only had one bar of service. I've never seen that before. I don't know why I thought that was funny, it was just so weird that I felt like I was in a horror movie or something, with my phone barely working. I was still quite terrified, and my own laughter sounded crazy to me.

Zaire drove crazy fast and got there before the police. I saw the headlights of his Mustang and heard his car, low and wide. I called him and told him to be careful.

I could hear how crazy it sounded, but my fear was real, and he listened as I warned him about the creatures in the fog.

He drove around the bus, circling it, revving his engine and letting his brakes shriek, honking and making so much noise that even I felt a little intimidated by his display. He pulled up alongside the bus, facing towards the back so that the passenger side lined up with the door of the bus.

He opened the passenger door and I saw his eyes, the first real relief I felt. We were still on the phone and he told me to simply push on the middle of the bus door as hard as I could. ""It will pop open, when you snap the emergency thing.""

I pushed as hard as I could and it didn't budge. I braced myself and pushed with my legs and something did snap and the doors just swung open, dropping me butt-first onto the step in the bus. I got up and leapt into his waiting car and slammed the door.

""You smell like sweat."" Zaire grinned weirdly, his eyes all crazy with adreneline.

""Punch it, Chewie."" I said, my breath a little shaky.

We sped out of there and went home. As we left that place behind I got a call from 9-1-1 since we got disconnected. I told them I was with my brother and headed home and gave them my apartment number when they asked.

The next day, two police detectives came to our apartment. Zaire had let them in and came into my room and woke me up. ""The cops want to talk to you. They sittin' on my couch.""

""You're Emily Radiance, you called 9-1-1 from the North Creek Park And Ride this morning?""

""Yes. I saw a guy get killed. There were these..."" I paused, realizing that if I told them what I saw, they were not going to believe me.

""Anthony Wink, the driver, is missing, and you said you saw someone killed. You can tell us what happened."" The other cop said.

""I woke up and he was missing already. It was this other guy, like homeless guy. He was dirty and he had a beard. I saw this gray crawler kill him. There were three more and they dragged him away."" I told them. They just sat and listened, not blinking. I remembered how he was still alive when they took him. I added, ""He was still alive, when those things dragged him away.""

I felt a tear across my cheek, recallin' the worst of it. For a long time, they just sat and looked at me, then one of them asked:

""Is there anything else?"" He asked. I just shook my head. When I had nothing else for them, they reluctantly left our apartment.

I could tell I was their only lead, and I had barely helped at all. I felt guilty, like I should have known more, should have observed some crucial detail to help them find Anthony Wink. I reached for my headphones, hopin' to get some peace from the fresh awful memory. I got up and searched my room and then acquired my brother's car keys to go down to his car. I'd lost my headphones - and worse - all my playlists.

I sat on the steps to our apartment when suddenly a police forensics van showed up. Confused I looked up while two police got out and asked me if I was Emily Radiance, the one who had called from the park and ride. They showed me their detective badges and asked me all about last night.

""What? Why you got that look, sweetie?"" One of them asked after they had asked me crazy questions.

""Two other cops were just here, in suits. They were in my apartment."" I had a disbelieving smirk. The two police looked at each other and one of them gave me his card, with their office number on it.

""That is strange, we have no idea who came here, this is our case."" He told me. ""And one more thing."" He opened the passenger door and took an evidence bag from the seat. It was my headphones, I must have dropped them when I fled the bus. He handed them to me and nodded, knowingly, as my eyes lit up.

""Thanks."" I felt a wash of relief, holding my music. Somehow as they drove away I felt like that was when it was finally over, like somehow the terror had lingered into the next day, and only as the fog-of-fear cleared was I finally safe.",3,1.0,1,dlschindler,2024-11-13 20:46:02,1gquwdq,4,Medium
NoSleep,What should I do with the jar in my fridge?,"I'm writing this here because I don't know what else to do.

Let me start from the start. I lived with my two roommates, Carmen and James, in a typical apartment off-campus. The three of us shared a fridge, and space was pretty tight, but we'd worked out as good system to avoid disagreements—ensuring that each of us had our own shelf, and anything in other areas of the fridge was labelled.

Carmen and James had been living in the apartment for a semester prior to me moving in, and while I was worried initially that the two of them might be cliquey, they were very welcoming. Both of them were straight-talking and adult without being rude or blunt, which was so refreshing after my experiences with some terrible roommates in places I'd lived before.

Everything was going smoothly—no moldy food, leftovers kept on our personal shelves, and boundaries respected. That was until the morning I opened the fridge, bleary-eyed and looking for coffee creamer, and found a weird jar on my shelf. 

What looked like gnarled roots were suspended in cloudy liquid that swirled as I examined the jar in my hand. The jar was old-fashioned, sealed with a two-part canning lid that seemed stuck tight. I'd never seen Carmen or James have anything like in the fridge this before, and in my mind I groped around for rationale as to how this could have showed up. As I struggled to open the lid, it finally loosened, not with the fresh *pop* of a sterile jar, but with the gritty sensation of corroded metal loosening its grip on rust. This jar looked like it had been here for years. I quickly screwed it shut again, not wanting to experience the smell of what was inside.

My fingers ran over something that felt like paper on the bottom of the jar. I checked that the lid was on tight before turning over the jar. There, on the base, was a dog-eared label with words written in old-fashioned cursive: *""To bind"".*

“Did either of you buy this?” I asked Carmen and James, but they both said no, barely paying attention. “If someone’s messing with me, just stop. It’s not funny,” I told them both, but neither of them took responsibility. It was too early to argue, so I shrugged and threw the whole jar in the trash. 

The next week or so, nothing else weird happened, and I started to forget about the jar that had shown up in the fridge. That was until the morning that James yelled my name from across the house.

*""EMMA!""* he shouted, and I immediately jumped up and headed downstairs to see what the matter was. It wasn't like him to randomly yell for me, and I could tell by his tone that something was wrong.

James was stood by the fridge, his face twisted into an expression of disgust. ""Emma, what the fuck is this?"", he shouted, as he opened the door.

I jumped back as he revealed the fridge was crawling with maggots. Their pale, segmented bodies were pulsing in sick rhythm as they wriggled up the inside walls of the fridge, each one swollen with a glistening sheen. In the center of the fridge was a mass of maggots in writhing clusters, and I realized with horror that they were concentrated around my box of leftover pizza—the pizza I'd ordered just the night before. 

""Emma, answer me! What the fuck is this?""

I was frozen with disgust, and my voice sounded stuttery and weak. ""I don't know, James... this has nothing to do with me, I swear!""

""Then why the fuck are they coming from your pizza box?""

I recoiled as James grabbed my box of pizza, seemingly so full of anger and adrenaline that he didn't care about the maggots crawling all over it, which scattered to the floor around our feet. The air puffed with spores that made me cough as he opened the lid, the once-cheesy slices nearly unrecognizable—swollen with mold, shades of green, black, and white spreading across the surface in fuzzy patches. Some spots seemed slick and slimy, others looked almost bubbly. Amid the rotting mess, maggots swarmed over each slice, their pale bodies weaving in and out of the gooey, decomposing crust. The air was filled with the dense, sour stench of decay and whispery, wet squelching of their bodies sliding against each other.

The sight of the decay inside the box was so shocking that I almost didn't notice the message on the inside of the lid, scrawled in harsh, capital letters: *""ENJOY WHILE IT LASTS"".*

James tilted the box to look at the message. ""What does this mean, Emma?""

""I don't know! The pizza was fresh, that message wasn't there last night...""

""So you're saying that me or Carmen must have done this? Why the fuck would we want to nuke our own fridge with maggots?""

""No, that's not what I'm saying! This is so fucked up...""

James' eyes were full of a hard rage that I hadn't seen before, and I was almost as scared of him as I was of the maggots. ""I don't even want to *hear* how this happened. It's your mess, clean it up, and you need to replace all of our food that's been ruined by this. This is unbelievable Emma, I really thought we could trust you."" He threw the pizza box on the counter and stormed from the room.

I cleaned it all up, filling up trash bags while crying with frustration and fear. I was so confused—there had been no hint of any decay when I'd eaten the pizza last night, and I'd simply thrown the leftovers in the fridge thinking I'd eat them later today. I didn't have the money to buy an entire fridge's worth of food for three people, and I was sick with worry that my living situation was descending into the same mess of hostility that I'd experienced before.

I spent about an hour on my knees in my rubber gloves, scooping up handfuls of maggots and dumping them in boiling water to kill them, then scrubbing the fridge with bleach. Neither James nor Carmen mentioned the incident to me again, although both of them had noticeably cooled towards me, and I spent as much time in my room as I could to avoid any awkward confrontations. Each time I opened the fridge, I braced myself, terrified that something else would appear. 

And I was right to be afraid, because a few nights later, it happened again.

I opened the fridge to grab a snack, only to find a plate on my shelf, front and center. On it was a slice of cake sat upright with a candle on the top, as if ready to present to a birthday girl. But the cake was old-looking, sagging and sunken. It looked kind of familiar—frosting a sickly shade of green, surrounded by hardened crumbs, and speckled with confetti-like sprinkles. My stomach dropped as I noticed the letters scrawled across the top in smeared icing. The first few letters of my name. *EMM…* 

It was unmistakably the same cake from my tenth birthday. I remembered that the frosting was a hideous shade of green because my mom had added too much food coloring. How could a slice of it be here, now, almost a decade later?

“Emma?” Carmen’s voice cut sharply through my thoughts, and I jumped. She was standing in the doorway, arms crossed. I felt like I'd been caught red-handed, guilty of some crime I had no part in, and I tried to use my body to block the cake. But the look in my eyes must have told her that there was something wrong. 

“What now?” she asked, walking over to the fridge and peering over my shoulder. Her eyes widened as she spotted the plate, and her mouth curled in disdain. “You can’t seriously expect us to believe this isn’t yours.”

“What? No, I—” I stammered, trying to find the right words, but she cut me off.

“James told me about the maggots, and now this? A slice of rotten cake with *your* name on it?” Her eyes were cold and sharp with accusation. “I don’t know what kind of game you’re playing, Emma, but it’s sick.”

“I swear, Carmen, I didn’t put this here!” I said, my voice filled with desperation. “I have no idea how any of this is happening!”

She snorted, folding her arms tighter. “You’re telling me that a weird cake with your name on it just magically appeared in our fridge? Do you even hear how insane that sounds?”

“I know how it sounds,” I whispered. My voice was brittle with shame. “But I’m not doing this. I haven’t done any of it.”

Carmen shook her head. Her face with was filled with disappointment, her eyes wrinkled with disgust, like she was contemplating a stranger doing something unsanitary. I'd hoped that some fragile trust was still there, but each syllable she spoke tore it down. “We were actually happy when you moved in. We thought you’d be different. But you’ve brought nothing but weirdness into our home. First the maggots, and now this? James and shouldn't have to live with constant gross surprises in the fridge.”

“Carmen, please. You have to believe me.”

“I don’t have to do anything,” she snapped. “We’re going to have to reconsider this whole living arrangement.”

Later that night I lay in bed, unable to sleep, replaying the argument with Carmen over and over in my head. I felt like I was going crazy, but I knew I wasn't responsible for this. Every other area of my life was healthy and happy. All I could think, unlikely as it seemed, was that James or Carmen were playing a trick on me. I didn't feel safe, I couldn't face a confrontation with them, and even if I could, our relationship would be forever tainted by what had happened.

I needed to talk to someone who might have an outside perspective on all this. I picked up my phone and called my mom.

“Hi, sweetheart!” She sounded cheerful at first, but her tone shifted when she heard the strain in my voice. “Emma? Is everything okay?”

I hesitated, unsure how to even begin, but eventually, the whole story spilled out. I told her about the maggots, the old cake with my name on it, and the jar of roots with the faded label.

She was silent for a moment. “A jar of roots? Are you sure that’s what it was?”

“Yes,” I replied. “It looked ancient, like it had been in the fridge for decades. And on the bottom, there was a label. It said, 'To bind.' Do you know what that could mean?”

There was a long pause before my mom spoke again, and when she did, her voice was hushed, threaded with a fear I’d never heard before. “Emma… there’s something I haven’t told you about our family. I thought… well, I hoped it would never be necessary. But hearing this, it sounds like…” She trailed off, and I felt her weighing the words she spoke next. “It sounds like an old ritual your great-grandmother once used. She was known to keep jars of herbs and roots, things meant to ‘bind’ or protect the family from harm.”

A chill ran through me. “Bind us from what, exactly?”

“I don’t know all the details,” she admitted, a soft tremble in her voice. “But I do know that these ‘bindings’ were meant to keep something at bay, to trap it or hold it back from affecting us. Emma, you didn't open the jar, did you?""

I felt my skin prickle, goosebumps raising as a wave of cold washed over me. ""Not completely, Mom... what if I did?""

A shaky breath escaped her, like she was trying to steady herself. “Honestly, I don’t know. I never believed much in the family stories, thought they were just superstitions. But I remember the jars and how your great-grandmother would never let anyone open them. She told me, ‘Never break the seal on a binding jar; otherwise, what’s inside might come for us.’”

Fuck. A thick silence settled between us as I processed her words, feeling like I'd unearthed a family secret that should have stayed buried. This couldn't be real... surely there was no such thing as witchcraft, or spirits? But as I cast my mind back to the stale cake and the writhing maggots, it all seemed way too weird to have any type of a rational explanation.

""Mom,"" I finally whispered, ""what if I come stay with you for a while? I need to get away from all of this.""

""Of course, sweetheart. Come home. We'll sort this out together."" She had the practiced steadiness in her voice of every parent that talks of Santa, tells you that pets go to a ""farm"", or assures you that everything will be alright.

I packed my things the next day, shoving everything into my bags hurriedly without any type of organization. I explained to Carmen and James that I'd pay the rent until my notice period was up, but I'd be leaving that day. They barely looked at me as I left, and I didn’t say goodbye. I couldn’t blame them after everything that had happened, but it still hurt. A strange loneliness crept over me as I left the apartment and headed back to my childhood home.

When my mom greeted me at the door, I melted into her warm hug, feeling the weight of the past few days begin to ease, just slightly. That night we spent the evening watching crappy romance shows on Netflix, talking about anything but what had happened.

It was early the next morning when I went to the kitchen, still groggy with sleep. My mom was already up, sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of black coffee. ""Morning,"" she said with a tentative smile.

There was some kind of current in the air, a chill that seemed like more than a draught. I think, deep down, I knew then that something was wrong. But I tried to pretend it was another normal morning, that I'd open the fridge door, grab some orange juice, and everything would be fine.

But pretending was useless.

It took me a moment to process what was inside the fridge. In front of me sprawled a massive, raw organ, fleshy and grotesque, throbbing and twitching with life. Its surface was a tangled mess of bulging veins and thick, sinewy fibers, each strand shining with wetness. The swollen blood vessels twisted over it like bloated worms, their contents sloshing with each faint throb. It sat in a thick pool of viscous, nearly black blood that dripped lazily off the shelf and splattered onto the floor with wet, sticky slaps. The coppery, metallic stench coated the insides of my nostrils, so thick and rancid it felt like it was crawling down my throat, filling me with a nausea that clawed its way up from my gut.

I stumbled back, gagging and clamping my hand over my mouth. This thing—it looked like a nightmare pulled from the depths of some twisted horror, something so wrong and obscene it felt like the air itself recoiled around it. This was something that had no place in any fridge, let alone my mom's.

On the shelf below, obscured by the shadow cast by the huge organ, another jar caught the faint glint of the fridge light. It was nearly identical to the one I’d found in the apartment—a murky jar filled with dark, viscous liquid and tangled, gnarled roots. 

But there was something different about this jar. A faded label clung to the side, the same spidery cursive as before spelling out the words: *“To Unbind.”*

I only realized my mom was by me when her shaking hands clasped my arm. Her face was completely pale. “Emma… this jar… this shouldn’t be here.”

I didn't want to believe this was happening, and it took so much effort to face the situation, not to run, screaming. But I wanted to be strong for my mom. “What do you mean? ‘To Unbind’? Is this… the thing I let out?”

Before she could answer, a strange, low noise filled the kitchen, like something huge exhaling. The air filled with a whispering, crackling sound, like the rustling of dry leaves, and underneath, a cracking noise like something brittle breaking. It was suddenly so cold, so damp even inside the room, like the air in the middle of a forest in a rainstorm.

I couldn't move. My eyes were fixed on the jar as the roots inside it started to twitch. At first I thought it was a trick of my eyes, a glimpse of a reflection moving. But then, unmistakably, they started to coil around each other, gripping and undulating like a nest of snakes.

My mom’s hand gripping my arm tighter seemed so small and fragile. “Emma… shut the fridge. Don’t touch it. We need to—”

But it was too late. The jar's lid spun round, loosening with a grinding *crick*, then a loud *hiss* as the lid popped off, filling the kitchen with the sour, sharp smell of decay. The dark liquid in the jar overflowed as the roots began to uncoil, slowly creeping out of the jar like blackened fingers reaching out for us...

My mom backed away. Her voice was filled with terror and urgency. “Emma, get away from it!”

I staggered back, so scared but unable to look away, as the roots began to slither out of the jar, squirming and stretching like the probing limbs of a hungry parasite. They crept out of the fridge with a slow, sickening purpose, inching toward us, each twisted tendril writhing and extending like the grasping arms of something pulled from a nightmare.

Then, with a stabbing jerk, the roots shot forward, wrapping themselves around my mom’s ankle. She let out a primal cry of shock and surprise that twisted the deepest parts of me as the roots tightened and pulled her back, and she fell to the ground with a sickening, dense crack as her head hit the tile floor. Blood ran down from her hairline, her eyes glassed over in shock as she whimpered with pain. I realized then what the roots were trying to do... they were trying to pull her towards the fridge.

“Mom!” I shrieked, grabbing her arms and pulling with all my strength, but the roots were relentless, tightening their hold the more that I pulled her away. The roots were throbbing as if something dark and alive coursed through them, and I could feel their strength, unnatural and monstrous. They were tied around her ankle like a ligature, and the skin underneath was raw and red, bruises blooming purple beneath their grip.

“Emma… it’s… feeding…” she gasped, her voice rasping and breathy with pain. I clung to her, pulling desperately, my hands gripping so tightly I no longer cared if it hurt her. My vision blurred with tears, panic filling every part of me as I choked on my own sobs. The roots felt stronger with every second, as if they were draining her life, and I knew I couldn’t hold out much longer…

There, at the edge of the kitchen table, I spotted a butter knife. It wasn’t much, but it would have to do. Keeping one arm wrapped around her, I reached out with shaking fingers, grabbing the knife and gripping it hard, my fingernails cutting into my palm. With all the strength I had left, I brought it down on the roots, slashing wildly and screaming like I was possessed.

The dull blade barely pierced the thick, fibrous surface of the roots, but still I hacked and sawed. My teeth were gritted tight as the knife slipped and skidded against the sinewy mass, tearing jagged gouges in the roots. 

But despite my ineffective weapon, it seemed like it was working—every wound gushed with black fluid, and the roots shuddered under the assault. They started twisting violently as if in pain, splattering my face with sticky black droplets, tasting like tar and decay. The roots recoiled from every jagged hack I laid into them, writhing and convulsing, the dark liquid making a mess of glossy smears across the tiles.

As they started to loosen I felt a wave of giddy disbelief wash over me, the same way that prey must feel escaping a predator. And suddenly, they retreated, and I pulled my mom free, dragging her back from the fridge as we collapsed together onto the floor. We were both covered in the smeared black liquid, but I couldn't feel anything but relief as we held each other, gasping, watching as the roots inched back into the jar. Meters of roots compressed themselves into a small, tight mass as they slithered back inside. The last root, in a way that was weirdly human, retrieved the lid and placed it back on top of the jar, which sealed back up with a soft *pop*.

The room was still and silent as if they had never moved at all, while my world had changed so completely.

My mom was so pale, and she could barely speak through her own sobs. “Emma… we need to bury it. Far away. Where it can’t find us again.”

""But what if it just comes back, Mom? What if what's in there doesn't let go that easily?""

My mom didn't answer.

I'm sitting at the kitchen table now, writing this up. I cleaned up the mess in the kitchen, cleaned the tarry fluid from off my skin. My mom's ankle is hurt, but okay.

But I don't know what to do with the jar in the fridge. Will it come back if we bury it? Will it burn if we set fire to it? Do we need a priest? What if whatever we do to make it go away makes it come back stronger, and angrier?

I know this isn't the end of this story. This is only a pause. The thing that's bound me isn't done—it's just biding its time.",27,1.0,2,niceynice876,2024-11-13 08:28:31,1gqe3ow,29,High
NoSleep,Friends Until The End,"I grew up a 90s kid. When I was in fourth grade, we packed up and moved to a new town because my step-dad started a job at the local prison. That’s where I first met Sarah. She was a year younger, but she'd skipped ahead, so we ended up in the same class. Sarah lived right next door, and it didn't take long before she’d invite me over, her small voice calling from the porch, asking if I wanted to come play with toys.

Sarah was a bit of a dork, I have to admit. With her glasses, braces, and nose constantly buried in a book, she fit the part. But she was warm, always ready with a smile, and more welcoming than anyone I’d met. She might have been a nerd, but she was my nerd. It didn’t take long for her to become my best friend. We walked to and from school side by side, and spent almost every spare moment together.

Years went by, and Sarah and I grew inseparable, two peas in a pod. Then came a day in eighth grade when I walked her home after school, like always. She asked if I wanted to come in, and I said yes. Her mother, Jane, met us at the door with a warm smile and a fresh batch of chocolate chip cookies. The smell filled the house, and the taste was perfect, sweet and comforting. Jane had a kind, gentle beauty, always beaming when she saw me. I thanked her and headed home after we finished the cookies. I didn’t know then that it would be the last time I’d see her alive.

The next morning, I went to Sarah's house and knocked on the door. No one answered. It felt strange, out of place. Worry nudged at me, so I made my way around to the back and found the spare key Sarah had once shown me, hidden in a fake rock by the flowerbed. I let myself in and stepped inside, calling out her name. That’s when I saw Jane, suspended in the middle of the room, a rope around her neck. I froze, eyes wide, breath caught in my chest. The sight was so raw, so unlike anything I’d ever known, and a scream escaped me. Moments later, Sarah came rushing in. The stoic look on her face told me she already knew. Soon, the house was filled with police, voices low and steady as they took Jane's body away.

After that day, Sarah changed almost overnight. The cheerful, book-loving girl I’d known vanished, replaced by someone entirely different. She swapped her bright, quirky clothes for dark, somber outfits; even her makeup turned dark, with black eyeliner tracing heavy lines around her eyes. It was as if a shadow had settled over her spirit. She grew quieter, more distant, and thinner, too—her chubby cheeks slimming down until her cheekbones stood out sharp and defined. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t notice. To my teenage mind, there was something striking, almost alluring, about this new version of Sarah, even if I couldn’t shake the feeling that the light in her had dimmed.

As a teenager, Sarah's arms bore the marks of her grief—thin, angry lines that she carved into her skin after her mom’s death. It became her way of coping, a way to quiet the pain she carried inside. I did everything I could to help her find another way, to keep her from hurting herself. I bought her rubber bands to wear on her wrists so she could snap them when the urge came. For a time, it seemed to help, a small barrier between her and the darkness she battled.

Freshman year of high school, Sarah and I started dating. It was her idea—she asked me out one afternoon. Part of me worried about what that might mean for our friendship, but after everything she'd been through, especially losing her mom, saying no just wasn’t an option. She assured me that we would be friends until the end. We took our time, moving at a pace so slow it felt like molasses. We shared moments and grew close, but intimacy came much later. It wasn’t until she turned 18 that we crossed that line, and that’s when life threw us another curve: Sarah found out she was pregnant.

We got an apartment together. I was excited when Sarah told me she was pregnant. Every day, I’d rest my hand on her growing belly and talk to our little one, imagining the future we’d have. But life had other plans. The first miscarriage hit us hard, but it didn’t end there. Over the next year and a half, we endured a heartbreaking string of five miscarriages. Each one chipped away at our hope, leaving cracks in places we didn't know could break. Desperate for answers, I went with her to the doctor to see if there was something wrong. But after all the tests and questions, the doctors reassured us: Sarah was healthy and perfectly capable of carrying a child.

I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off, a nagging sense that Sarah wasn’t telling me the whole story. I’m ashamed to admit it now, but the doubt got the best of me. I bought a small GPS tracking device and, one day while helping with groceries, I hid it in the trunk of her car. A few weeks later, her sixth “miscarriage” happened. But the tracker showed her car had been parked at a Planned Parenthood clinic. The truth hit like a punch to the chest: Sarah hadn’t been losing our babies to fate—she’d been choosing not to keep them all along.

A little more snooping, digging through old bills and receipts, and the truth became undeniable. Everything lined up—doctor’s visits, payments to clinics. The pieces of the puzzle clicked together, and I couldn’t escape the reality that Sarah had been getting abortions all along. Each miscarriage wasn’t what she’d told me it was. The weight of it all settled on me, heavy and suffocating.

I laid out the evidence on the table and waited for Sarah to get home from her job at the supermarket. When she walked in, I didn’t waste any time—I asked, ""What is this?"" Her face crumpled, and for the first time in all the years I’d known her, I saw her cry. She hadn’t cried when her mother passed, not during 9/11, or through any of the other moments that should’ve broken her. But now, she just broke down, tears pouring out without end. For over an hour, she cried, refusing to say anything, unable to answer any of my questions. I watched her fall apart, and for a moment, I felt guilty—like I had done something wrong by confronting her. She made me feel like the bad guy for just wanting the truth.

That night, Sarah left without saying a word, and didn’t come home until the next day. When she did, it was like a switch had flipped. Gone was the dark, emo look she’d been wearing for so long. Instead, she was dressed in bright, colorful clothes—her nerdy style fully returned. She was wearing glasses again, no longer bothered with her contact lenses, and there was no trace of black in her outfit. Her whole demeanor had shifted too; she was bubbly, cheerful, almost as if nothing had happened. I was in complete shock, unable to wrap my head around this sudden transformation. It felt like the girl I’d known was back—only she was different somehow, and I couldn’t figure out how.

She came over to me and wrapped her arms around me in a hug. Instinctively, I hugged her back, but then I felt a sharp pain in my gut. I gasped as I realized she had been concealing a knife, and now it was buried in my belly. She whispered in my ear, her voice unnervingly calm, ""I saw the way you looked at my mother. She can't have you. You're mine, until the end. I made sure of that a long time ago.""

The knife twisted, sending a wave of agony through me, but my mind was stuck in complete shock. She kept talking, her words cold and deliberate, ""Did you really think I would let our little ones take your full attention away from me? You’re mine, until the end. And this is the end.""

I shoved her away from me, and in the process, she stumbled backward and hit her head on the coffee table. Dizzy and light-headed from the blood pouring from my gut, I staggered to my feet, clutching my stomach, and stumbled out the door. My vision blurred, but I managed to get to my car and dial 911. The police arrived, but by the time they got there, Sarah was already gone, vanished without a trace.

They rushed me to the hospital, and somehow, I survived. That was the last time I ever saw her in person. I moved states, changed my name, tried to escape the memories of that night. But no matter where I go, I still get anonymous letters in the mail—on my birthday, on our anniversary. The words are always the same: ""Friends until the end."" Each one a haunting reminder that Sarah might not be done with me yet.",45,0.85,17,Downtown-Campaign536,2024-11-13 04:34:34,1gqa05z,62,High
NoSleep,The sound in the vents,"I used to think that moving into my first apartment alone would be freedom, the start of a new chapter. The place was old but cozy, nestled in a quiet corner of town. Nothing too fancy, but it was all mine. I’d only been there a week when the noises began.

It started with a faint scratching. At first, I chalked it up to the old building. Creaking pipes, maybe, or rats. I reported it to the landlord, who gave me a look of polite concern but promised they’d send someone to check. Days went by, and the scratching grew louder, more constant, always in the early hours of the morning. No one came.

I started losing sleep. I’d lie in bed with a pillow over my ears, desperate for the silence to return, but instead, it seemed to get closer, more insistent. One night, I couldn’t take it anymore. I got up and pressed my ear to the vent in my bedroom wall, trying to pinpoint the source. My heart pounded as I listened to the steady scraping, like nails clawing at metal. Then it stopped, and I swear, just for a moment, I heard breathing.

The next day, I tried calling the landlord again, but no one picked up. I went down to the building's front office, but the lights were off, a ""Closed for Repairs"" sign taped to the door. I hadn't seen my neighbors much, but now I was wondering if they’d heard anything strange, too. I knocked on a few doors, but no one answered.

That night, the noises changed. No more scratching, this time, I heard a voice. A low, muffled whisper echoing from inside the vent. I couldn’t make out the words, but it sounded… angry. I backed away, feeling a cold sweat prickling down my back. Something was inside the walls, something aware. I could feel its eyes on me, its breath hot and close, like it knew I was listening.

In the morning, I found strange marks around the edges of the vent cover in the bathroom. Tiny scratches, almost like claw marks. But that wasn't the worst part. As I leaned in to inspect them, I caught a faint smell, damp and rotten, like something decaying. I gagged and stumbled back, covering my nose.

Desperate for help, I reached out to my family. My mom tried to reassure me that it was just my imagination, but I could hear the unease in her voice. No one could shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong. That night, I sealed my bedroom vent with tape and tried to sleep.

But it wasn’t enough. Sometime around 2 a.m., I heard something scraping along the walls behind my bed. Louder this time. Closer. I held my breath, frozen, as it dragged itself around the perimeter of the room. The air felt thick, oppressive, and I could almost feel the presence outside my wall. Then, the whispering began again, faint but unmistakable, like someone hissing from the other side of the wall.

“Let me in…”

I bolted upright, scrambling to turn on my lamp. The room filled with light, and the noises stopped. Everything went silent. I tried to calm myself, but I could feel something watching, lurking just beyond the wall. I didn’t sleep that night.

The next day, I packed a bag and left. I couldn’t take it anymore. I found a hotel for the night and promised myself I’d find a new place as soon as I could. But just as I was about to turn out the lights, I heard it. The same scratching sound. The same faint, hissing whisper.

It had followed me.",7,0.9,0,CuteJodiee,2024-11-13 13:15:23,1gqkxgz,7,High
NoSleep,Emma is an Extrovert,"Emma was an extrovert.

But she hadn't always been one. 

I suppose it’s my fault we drifted apart, in the end. The truth was, I fell for all that bullshit: I listened to that voice, the sneering one that nipped at the back of my ears with its sharp incisors, the one that asked, *why is your only friend a girl?* I fell for the indoctrination every twelve year old boy does. And it wasn’t like she was a tomboy, either — she was a real, proper *girl*, complete with the star-and-heart shaped hair clips, sweeping blonde bangs and posters of horses and boybands all over her purple painted walls. She liked fairies, she liked unicorns. I liked her anyways. She was funny, and she always asked me questions, and she always shared. She was quiet around others, her long face always pointed down at her shoes, but she wasn’t like that with me. 

It was my fault we drifted apart. But I couldn’t stand how they looked at us, all of them, when we were playing together next to the basketball courts — I didn’t like how the girls scoffed, how the boys shouted things I couldn’t quite make out and then shoved each other, laughing uproariously… but the worst were the adults. I saw the looks they gave each other when Emma and I showed up to class side by side, secret looks, but I knew what they meant. *Hope we get invited to the wedding, right?*

So I stopped hanging out with Emma. I made new friends, boys who liked soccer and spitting contests, and the looks and whispers stopped. And Emma stayed alone. 

That was until high school. When we got to high school, I started to notice that Emma had changed. 

At lunch, when I went out to the front lawn with my friends to toss a frisbee back and forth like wannabe college kids, I started to see her with other people. When I passed through the halls, I saw her with boys leaning against lockers, laughing and placing her hand on their shoulders. Every day it seemed like there were more people, more friends, surrounding her like a school of fish around a shipwreck. This wouldn’t be unusual, except that Emma was always such a small, timid girl. She had been a loner since she was tiny. This was when I truly realized I didn’t know who she was anymore. I didn’t necessarily miss her anymore, it had been years since we had so much as spoken to each other, but it still gave me a strange pang in my chest to think it. 

Emma was an extrovert now, I realized. She was nice to everyone, a huge smile was always pulling at her glossy lips. Her hair was always perfect, falling in little swoops at her shoulders, she wore bright pinks and oranges and blues in the form of tight skirts and frilly blouses. She was attractive to the boys in an approachable way, but so nice to the girls that she was never considered a threat. Just a friend. 

Even from a distance, I could observe that everyone liked Emma. How could you not like Emma? 

At graduation, I looked for her. While I was accepting my fake diploma up on the stage, my friends and family cheering for me from the sea of faces, I searched the crowd for Emma. I spotted her quickly, near the back — someone was talking to her animatedly, a girl with a tight brown ponytail and braces, and she was smiling a strange smile, but she wasn’t responding. Instead, she stared straight forward. I felt my face get a little hot: *was she looking at me?* *Should I wave or something?* But when I squinted my eyes, I could tell that it wasn’t me she was looking at. 

She was looking somewhere behind me. 

After the ceremony, I looked for her again. I tried to part the mass of bodies, muttering *excuse me's* and *sorry's* as I went. She was surrounded by a throng of her peers, all speaking so loudly and cheerfully that I couldn’t make out anything she was saying. I got a glimpse of her face for a split second — she was smiling in that same strange way, almost sad. I finally heard her say something, her pink lips parting like they were crumpled up, as if she was crying. 

*“I’m going to miss you all so, so much.”* 

Then came college. Emma and I ended up at the same school, one that was far enough away from home to feel like a grown up, but not far enough to actually be one. In college, I saw her less, so I thought of her less. College was much bigger than high school, and I had much more to think about than my old childhood friend. But when I did see Emma, things seemed the same. Always surrounded by people, always smiling. 

I made new friends. I tried out for the soccer team, and I made it. My grades were okay, B to C average, and my roommate was weird, but he always left me alone. I felt content with the little life I had been building. 

That was until the party. 

It was by no means the first college party of the year, nor the craziest. I was told it would be just a couple of kids at one of the houses on campus, being rented out by seniors, but in typical college party fashion, it got out of hand pretty quickly. 

I went with a couple of my own friends, and we mostly stayed in the kitchen, crammed into the corner with mystery drinks clutched in our hands. The whole place reeked of smoke, and all the lightbulbs had been changed to colored ones, giving the house almost an eerie nightclub vibe. It wasn’t anything special, but feeling the warm buzz brought on by a mixed drink in a red plastic cup, crouched in a stranger’s kitchen with new friends, I was feeling pretty good. 

I knew when Emma got there. I could claim I sensed it, like it was some sort of psychic superpower, but I just knew by the chatter. The air suddenly felt livelier, and people funneled from the kitchen to the living room, calling out greetings. 

My friends and I used the temporary quiet in the kitchen to get ourselves fresh drinks, and then we filed out to the porch to smoke. My warm feeling only grew, and soon I was laughing so hard I felt I might piss myself, elbowing my friends in the way that’s only okay when you’re drunk. The music thumped from inside the house, muted by the sliding glass door, and I didn’t even feel the cold. 

When we finally decided to go back inside, I was surprised to find the kitchen entirely empty. I frowned, and checked my phone. It was only around midnight — why would everyone be gone? 

That was when I heard someone shout from the other room, and my friends and I eyed each other. I felt a guilty twinge at how excited the prospect of a fight breaking out made me, but I wanted *stories*, I wanted the *college experience*. 

We all rushed into the living room. And that was when I saw her. 

Emma was on the table, and everyone in the room was facing her, as if she were a caged animal in the zoo. She was on her hands and knees, but in a way that told me she’d been standing up before, clutching a clear bottle in one hand and the edge of the table with the other. I watched, horrified, as she wretched over the side, wobbling back and forth like a swaying ship. Everyone shouted in dismay and crashed backwards towards the wall, wanting to avoid the splash zone, and I was very nearly forced out of the room. 

“N-No,” she moaned, wiping at her mouth with the back of her hand, the bottle clanking against her shirt buttons. “I’m sor-sorry… I’m sssso sorry…” 

Clearly she had had too much to drink, and I wondered what I had missed before we’d come in. My friends were laughing, nudging each other and me, but I didn’t join them. Emma keeled over, flopping pathetically on the table, as someone shouted *“get down!”,* their voice brash and cruel. Someone else laughed. Someone else started taking pictures of her.

I had never seen her like this. And I had never seen anyone be mean to Emma, not since middle school, at least. 

I like to think I saw her wet skirt before anyone else did — at least, I hope that’s true. I would hate for everyone there to remember their last time seeing her alive as her slumped over on someone’s table, pee trickling down her legs and pooling at her hip, hugging an empty bottle like a teddy bear. 

I shoved through the crowd on an instinct, ignoring my friends questioning shouts trailing after me. I reached Emma in a few seconds, gently trying to pry the bottle from her hands and pull her from the table. 

She finally acknowledged me when I scooped her up into my arms, wincing at the wetness soaking through my shirt sleeves. Her eyes fluttered open and she stared up at me, her eyes glazed over. 

“An… Andrew?” She slurred. I nodded, my face made of stone. The people all around us let out a collective *oooh*, and I was back in middle school, letting go of Emma’s hand, refusing to look her in the eye. 

I looked her in the eye then, though, and she smiled in that sad way that only I seemed to ever notice. Then she threw up on my shirt. 

I got her to the bathroom and I locked it behind us as thralls of people pounded against it with their fists, chanting our names. *EM-MA! AN-DREW! EM-MA! AN-DREW! We’ve become the most interesting thing at the party*, I thought. *We've become the spectacle*. Emma sobbed as I helped her into the bathtub, figuring it would be the easiest to clean off later.

Emma’s head fell back against the tile and she groaned. I silently slipped off my shirt and scrubbed at it in the bathroom sink, choking back my own bile as I did. I wasn’t drunk anymore, or at least, I didn’t feel it. 

“Andrew,” she whispered after a long time. I looked over at her. She had pushed her blonde hair away from her eyes, stringy with spit and vomit. She stared up at me, watery and trembling. 

“Yes, Emma?” 

I gave up on my shirt and sighed, shaking it out and pulled it back on. I shuddered at how it clung to my skin. 

“I’m s-sorry.” 

“It’s okay, Emma.” I closed the toilet seat so I could sit on top of it, next to where she was laying. “Are you okay?” 

She shook her head, quickly, and then slower. Her eyes opened wide and I recognized something new in them: *fear*. 

“I ruined everything,” she whispered, frantic, her voice frayed around the edges. I frowned and leaned closer, wanting to hear her. 

“What do you mean, you ruined everything?” 

“Maybe I w-wanted to, I dunno…” She buried her face in her hands, whimpering into them. “Maybe I meant to, Andrew. Maybe I’m s-sick of this… maybe I can’t do it anymore…” 

“Do *what* anymore?” I pleaded, a little bit alarmed. She was rocking back and forth now, her breath coming in raspy wisps.

She peeked at me from between her fingers now, as if she were surveying me. She hiccuped, and that somehow triggered a new wave of blubbering sobs, tears dripping from her chin like fat raindrops. 

“I used to be s-so *jealous* of you,” she sniveled, wiping at her red nose. “You had so many friendsss… so many friends… and I couldn’t h-have any of ‘em… and then, and *then!* And then I was jealous of you ‘cause you didn’t have to have any.” 

My eyebrows furrowed almost a painful amount, and I searched her face, unsure if I should feel offended by this or not. The pounding on the door continued. *EM-MA! EM-MA!*

“What do you mean, Emma? I don’t understand.” 

Her eyes glazed over, her tears still falling, and she stared through me at the bathroom door. Half there, half not. 

“It follows me,” she whispered, so weak I could barely hear her. Her breathing quickened. 

“What follows you?” 

She shook her head, and pulled at her hair. Finally her eyes met mine again, as if she were phasing back into reality. 

“It’s in *them*,” she spit, jabbing a finger at the door. “It’s in all of them. It’s watching me, always. It always knows. When I don’t have any friends, it gets angry.” 

*EM-MA! EM-MA! EM-MA!*

I could do nothing but stare at her, trying to figure out if she was serious or not. She must have still been pretty drunk, but right then, she seemed stone cold sober. 

“I have to have friends,” she continued, the tears never slowing down. “I’ve done all my research. I wear the right clothes, I go to their houses and I peek through their windows. I know what they like, what they don’t like, I have a binder. Everyone I meet is in my binder. Everyone has to like me, Andrew, or it’ll kill me. I know it will. It gets closer every time I lose a friend. It started with you.” 

I felt suddenly very cold. I heard the words she wasn’t saying: *you were the very first friend I ever lost.* I thought of her at graduation, staring at something that wasn’t there behind me, that strange smile on her face… and I started to believe her. 

*EMMA! EMMA! EMMA! EMMA! BANG BANG BANG BANG!*

“And now they all hate me,” she sobbed bitterly, hugging herself. “I did it to myself. All of that work, and one night… one night, one mistake, is going to kill me. It’s going to kill me now. It’s going to kill me.” 

“No it isn’t,” I heard myself say. I kneeled next to her, catching her franticness like a cold. “No, it’s not. You’re safe in here.”

“It’s going to kill me…” she mumbled. I wasn’t sure if she even heard me. “All that work, and it’s going to kill me…” 

“You’re safe in here, and I’m your friend… I’m still your friend…” 

I reached out, and I took her hand. Her skin was white and cold, as if she was already dead. 

***EMMAEMMAEMMAEMMAEMMAEMMAEMMABANGBANGBANGBANGBANG!***

The voices had all morphed into one horrific amalgamation. The door hinges creaked and shuddered, like they were only just clinging on. The lock rattled. Emma let out a little shriek. 

Without thinking about it, I climbed into the bathtub with her and pulled the curtain shut. I didn’t care anymore about getting any of her bodily fluids on me. Besides, it was too late for that anyways. 

She stared at me. Her eyes looked almost grey, and they were shiny, flickering with something I had never seen before. 

“It’ll happen to you next,” she told me, her voice solemn. “I don’t know how I know, but I do. I’m sorry, Andrew.” 

“It’s okay, Emma.” ***BANG BANG BANG BANG.*** “For what it’s worth… I wish we stayed like we were.” 

She scooted closer to me, resting her head on my shoulder at an awkward angle. “I do too.” 

Then, the bathroom door gave way. 

When the police arrived, I told them the truth. I didn’t know what else to say. I was far too out of it to make up a story. So, after hours of interrogation and psych evaluation, I was finally released to go home and scrub her blood off of me. Probably because it was impossible to fathom how I, one boy, could possibly do to her what was done to her.

It brought me no relief. 

A week ago, I went to her old house — it was a two hour drive away, about a block away from my old house. Her mom was there and she let me in, teary eyed. She remembered me. 

“Would you mind if I went through her things a bit?” I asked her, my voice gentle, but I couldn’t force much emotion into it. I was still reeling from what I’d experienced at that party. “I think there are some things she would want me to have.” 

Her mother just nodded and led me to her room. 

It was exactly how I remembered it. Purple wallpaper, adorned with various brightly colored posters. Unicorn figurines and stuffed animals covering the bed and the carpet. Untouched. She has still been such a little loser, even in high school, when I had thought she was so cool. 

I rifled through her drawers until I found it: a purple binder. I almost smiled at the butterfly stickers decorating the surface, one scratch away from peeling off completely. 

I flipped through it slowly. She hadn’t lied: she really did do her research. Everyone from our high school was in there, their pictures taped haphazardly next to lists and lists of things about them, things that Emma never should have even known. She had been trying desperately to save her own life. 

When I got to my own entry, I hesitated. There was significantly less content on my page, as if she’d decided it wasn’t even worth it. My picture, cut straight out of the yearbook, seemed to look right at me. A thought flashed into my head then, burning behind my eyelids, and tears began to form. I wiped them away quickly, alarmed. 

*You are so, so alone.* 

And somewhere far away, I could hear it. Pounding against wood. Chanting. *AN-DREW, EM-MA, AN-DREW, EM-MA, AN-DREW…* ",250,0.97,20,orangeplr,2024-11-12 17:02:53,1gpy7vu,270,High
NoSleep,The Christmas Eve Shift,"It was my second year with the force, and me and my partner, Mendell, had drawn the short straw: we were both working Christmas Eve. As patrol officers we'd be driving around doing our usual routine, only on the night that most people would rather be doing anything but working. The scene is still vividly burned into my mind: we were in our cruiser slowly driving down a quiet road a little past midnight whilst keeping an eye out - and an ear to the radio - for any car wrecks, drunks, or some other kind of incident that required our attention. To nobody's surprise though, in a smaller, semi-rural town on Christmas Eve, there wasn't a soul outside except for us. I was sitting in the passenger seat watching the snow flurries fall out the side window and musing about the few hours of sleep I'd be lucky to get once home before my kids inevitably woke up early and excited to go tearing through the presents ""Santa"" had left under the tree for them when the call came in. 

""This is dispatch, we have a potential home invasion in progress, requesting officers to the scene immediately.""

""Copy that,"" Mendell spoke into the radio. ""Address?"" 

As dispatch delivered our location, I felt a small lump form in my stomach and my heart skip a beat as I looked over in Mendell's direction. He obviously was thinking the same thing as I, as he mirrored my actions before turning back to the road, flicking on the car beacons, and increasing our speed. 

The address of the home was one we were both familiar with. Three days prior we had been called to the same house. The owner, a single mother, around early 30s I guessed, with two young kids had called 911 saying she thought there was someone outside her house. When we arrived at the scene she had timidly opened the door for us and we took a look around the property. According to her she was preparing to take the trash out when she saw something moving outside the kitchen window, after which she promptly ran upstairs and locked her and the kids in the bathroom before calling the police. She couldn't provide us with much of a description, only that she briefly saw a ""shadowy"" figure before she had bolted. We checked the area around the window but found nothing. It had snowed earlier that day, so a fresh blanket covered the lawn and would've revealed clear footprints had someone been there, but the snow around the window was undisturbed. We checked the rest of the area around the house, but came up with nothing there either. 

The woman, Beth as she told us, was very clearly terrified by the ordeal, but there wasn't much we could do. She was very adamant about having seen what she saw, and repeatedly emphasized that she ""wasn't crazy"". While I'm not sure Mendell or I were convinced anything had actually been there, after all there was no physical evidence and the human brain isn't immune to tricking itself, I did sympathize with her. Having kids myself, I know how powerful the drive to protect them is, and the thought of not being able to do so is any parent's worst nightmare. As we stood there in the house's entrance hall, Beth still trembling and her two kids - the older looked no more than six - looking down from the staircase banister, I had asked her if she had anywhere else she and the kids could go for the night just as a safety precaution. She responded in the negative, saying a hotel would've been too expensive, and the only family they had lived in another state. After that we told her to call if anything else happened and left. I could sense both Mendell and I were a bit weirded out by the situation, but neither of us spoke about it in the days since.

That was until now, as we found ourselves called back to the same location days later. Pulling up in front of the innocuous two story home, we both exited the car quickly. Something was immediately different about the place. It looked the same as it had days ago: the same plastic Santa in the yard, the multicolored Christmas lights strung along the porch, but something was off. I could feel it, even if I couldn't quite place what it was. I placed a few heavy knocks on the door and announced our presence. No response. I knocked again. No response. 

Mendell took a few steps over and peered through the window into the dark house before quickly turning around in surprise. I had initially though he had seen something inside, but followed his gaze to the porch railing, where the lights that had been providing what little illumination they could, had now gone dark. 

""They went out as soon I looked inside."" He said, sounding a bit confused. I wasn't sure if he was talking to himself or to me, but I began answering anyways.

""They could just be on a timer or-"" I was cut off mid sentence by a loud thud from inside the house. We both gave each other a quick glance to make sure we were on the same wavelength before drawing our weapons. 

""Police. We're coming in!"" I yelled before grabbing the doorknob. I had expected it to be locked, had expected us to have to force our way inside, but to my surprise, and unease, the door provided no resistance in opening itself. The entrance hall was deadly still. I grabbed my flashlight and shined it around looking for whatever had caused the noise we heard, but nothing was out of place. Mendell nodded his head towards the stairs, and I nodded back, understanding. He'd check upstairs while I took the ground floor. Ducking into the dining room on the left as I heard Mendell's footsteps ascending up, I began a methodical room-by-room sweep of the first floor. To say I was on edge was an understatement. I still couldn't pinpoint what it was, but something was very off in that house. Every corner I turned, every crevice I turned my light towards I had expected to find something, only to be met with nothing every time. Everything looked to be where it should be, no signs of robbery or a struggle, no signs of any life at all. 

I slowly made my way into the living room, the final unchecked room, and began taking in my surroundings. A Christmas tree, a fake one by the looks of it, stood in the corner of the room by a magnificent fireplace. Through my flashlight revealed strings of lights decorated around it, they remained dark like the rest of the house. A few colorful wrapped presents sat underneath in a pile, practically begging to be torn open, while on the living room table I spotted a glass of milk and an undisturbed plate of cookies next to a note reading ""For Santa"". Despite how cheerful the sight should've been, in the context of the dark, quiet house, illuminated only by flashlight, the scene filled me with an inexplicable sadness. Something clearly wasn't right here, and the thought of whatever it was happening on Christmas of all days, was upsetting to me. 

I was tensely scanning my flashlight along bookshelves, looking at family photos and an old radio when the sound of my walkie talkie going off nearly made me pull the trigger of the gun that was tightly gripped in my other hand. I set the flashlight down on the shelf and grabbed the walkie.

""Yeah?"" I spoke, my voice unexpectedly shaky. 

""I found the kids, they're safe."" Mendell replied. A bit of relief washed over me before he continued ""No sign of the mom though. They say she went downstairs and never came back.""

""She's not down here. I've checked every room.""

""Maybe she left? The door was unlocked when we got here."" 

I wasn't sure how to respond. With how shaken Beth had been a few days ago, it didn't make sense to me that she would run and leave her kids behind. There had also been that thud... 

As my thoughts trailed off, all hell broke loose. All the lights in the living room, both the overhead and those on the tree, turned on and began flickering at a rapid pace. I frantically looked over at the switch only to see it in the off position. My eyes turned to the adjacent rooms only to see that they were all experiencing the same phenomenon. Suddenly the bookshelf radio roared to life, blasting Christmas carols at a volume that made my ears hurt. 

""What the hell is going on?"" Mendell yelled through the radio, though I ignored him. With the rapid light flickering I spotted something I hadn't before, something that made the knot in my stomach contract tighter. In the fireplace a few unburnt logs lay resting, and on those logs I could see a few bright red spots. Amidst the sensory overload happening all around, I grabbed my flashlight and began making my way to the fireplace on shaking legs. Crouching down, I shone my light directly into the fireplace. My initial thought had been right. Pooled around the logs, and spotting them with little dots, was the unmistakable sight of fresh ruby-red blood. A fresh drop splashed down, sliding down the log and joining the forming puddle. Then another. I couldn't hear my heartbeat over the music, but I could certainly feel it. I didn't want to do it, but I had to. Reluctantly I crawled forward, shined my light up the chimney, and angled my head to look.

I wish I hadn't. 

Stuffed halfway up the chimney, body crushed and mangled to fit in the entirely-too-small space, was a human. I stared directly into the dead eyes of Beth, her face contorted into an eternal, silent scream as she stared down back at me, blood dripping down her face. I lurched backwards in terror as a new nightmare began. Even louder than the still-playing Christmas music from the radio, a rapid heavy stomping sound began permeating throughout the house. Only it didn't sound like it was coming from inside the house, but rather outside on the roof. Gun in one hand, flashlight in the other, I darted for the door at a speed I don't think I've ever moved before. Still disoriented from the lights and sounds, and Beth's face engraved into my mind, I stumbled out into the yard and turned my gaze to the roof. 

Whatever was making the pounding had ceased now, and I quickly scanned my light to find the source. I stopped when I found it. Standing upright next to the chimney was a slender, lanky figure. It was completely dark, and would've been impossible to see had my light not been fixed on it. My brain wasn't fully comprehending what I was looking at, but my eyes weren't lying to me. Whatever it was was a crude mockery of a human. Limbs elongated and stretched beyond reasonable proportion, a head that sat loosely to the side as though it had a broken neck, and skin as dark as a void. It looked like a twisted, broken shadow come to life. Although it had no eyes, or any facial features at all for that matter, I could tell it's attention was directed at me. 

Both light and gun fixed on the thing, we both stood completely still. The house lights flickering madly, music still audible from the living room, the snow falling around us, yet neither of us dared move. My concentration on the thing was broken only when I heard the unmistakable sound of a gunshot, though not from mine. I turned around quickly to see backup had arrived. One of the officers was still exiting the car while the other was already in position, gun aimed at the roof. As quick as I looked back, I whipped my head forwards towards the rooftop. The thing had hunched over and appeared agitated now, though it seems the shot had missed it. I slowly raised my hand up to signal to the others not to fire again, but before the gesture was completed the creature silently flung itself backwards off the roof. Not wanting to lose it, and my brain working on autopilot at this point, I made a mad dash for the backyard. Part of me expected to find the thing injured from the fall, or perhaps ready to jump me if it wasn't hurt, but as the backyard came into view there was... nothing. 

I frantically shined my light around, but there was nothing in the backyard. The snow all around was undisturbed. It was like whatever it was had completely vanished. The officer who fired the shot, Hughie, had caught up to me at the backyard. He took a look around, shining his own flashlight as his face contorted in confusion. 

""Where... did it go?"" 

I didn't have an answer for him.

\---

After everything was done, we had searched the entire property up and down several times over. We searched nearby properties. Nothing. There was no trace of that creature anywhere. According to the two kids their mom said she had heard noises outside the house, so she woke them up, hid themselves all in the bathroom and called the police. After that there was what sounded like a knock at the door, so she went downstairs and never came back. Because she told them not to leave, they stayed there until Mendell found them. 

Mendell and I gave our testimony on everything that happened in the house. I hesitantly described what I had seen on the roof, and was a bit relieved that the other two officers backed me up on it so I didn't seem like I lost my mind. Something had been there, but I, nor anyone else, had any explanation for what happened or what it was. Beth's case remained open for a bit, but with nothing to work with it quickly died off. The official report only said that her body had been ""crushed"", resulting in her death. 

It's been about a year since then, and I find myself constantly thinking back to that night. As much as I've tried to forget, I always find those memories creeping in. The blaring Christmas music. Beth's mangled face. The thing on the roof. I've replayed the events over and over in my mind while awake, and even more times while sleeping. I had talked about it a bit with the others, especially Mendell, but none of us could make any sense of it. More than anything I just want answers, but deep down I know there are none to be had. The real story of what happened that night will never be fully understood. At the very least, I asked not to work Christmas this year.

NoSleep,I’m a witch and I found something in the woods,"I’m a witch.

While that may sound far fetched it is true. I’ve always at least somewhat believed in the supernatural. Call it instinct, call it superstition, or call it naivety. No matter what, I can work with magic and spirits well enough.

I live in Colorado, near the mountains. While we all know that the Appalachian mountains are scary most people don’t realize the horror of their younger cousins. They are young, and they lack any of the ancient life of their elders but their horrors are far less known. But I’m getting sidetracked, let’s get into the meat of the story.

I woke up at about 6 in the morning on the saturday when this began. I was going to head into the mountain forest at that time so I was preparing accordingly. I put on my favored old hunting boots, a warded flannel jacket, and I wore a belt with an abundance of pouches. I put my ritual knife, a crescent shaped blade with a bone handle and several spells on it, in its sheath and slung my rifle over my shoulder before heading out. After all I know better than to assume the woods are safe.

The twenty minute drive to my little dead end of a dirt road was calm, if only the whole trip was like that.

In the early morning chill I trudged uphill to a brilliant, purple and blue, clearing of wildflowers where I crouched down and started cutting some columbines by the stem, the morning dew fresh upon my skin. Calmly I started to cut through my next set of flowers, some larkspurs which were flourishing, their harvesting accompanied by the song of birds. Thus I stepped to my final harvest. I cut some bluebells by the stem and started placing them in a pouch. As I was crouched by them I heard a twig break. I snapped my head up and held my knife in front of me, but there was nothing there. I assumed it was just some animal, but that was my first mistake.
I walked onward towards my next destination, a small stream a mile or so away. I walked through and my eyes watched for familiar landmarks, a oddly bent tree here, a dilapidated wooden structure there, but as often as there were familiar landmarks there were unfamiliar things. A tree had some fresh damage which might have been claw marks, a little fox den a few meters away from my path collapsed, and a mutilated corpse.

That was something else I should have noted, I approached the corpse only to see what appeared to be some sort of deer. I’ve never really been disturbed by death or gore so I felt it would be worth it to take this animal corpse which had clearly fallen upon a trap or got a stray buckshot striking it or something. After all, it would be a waste to just leave it behind. So I got to work, blood pouring into a preset jar, meat squelching as I skinned the creature. As I methodically skinned the creature I met its glassy eyes, there was no life in them but there was something there. In the reflection of the eyes I saw something rush between two trees. On instinct I grabbed my .22 rifle, it wouldn’t do much but it could scare off a threat, and I started poking around, my bloody knife resting in its sheath. But nothing was there, not just no animal but nothing, it was dead silent. There was only my breath and the sound of my fingernail tapping against the gun’s barrel.

I mumbled a quiet prayer, “Lady Artemis, mistress of the hunt and the wilds, please grant me safety in this wood.” and another, “I call upon the green, grant me safe passage and forage.” And several other prayers. I wasn’t actually scared then, but I wish I had been maybe things would be different then.

As my search yielded no results I returned to the carcass and continued harvesting, the empty eyesockets peering into me. As I finished harvesting the corpse it was midday and I had used a small tarp I kept in one of my larger bags to carry it over my shoulder as a rucksack I carried on to the stream. As I walked the forest returned to life and the hairs on the back of my neck that I didn’t even know were raised settled down. I quickly checked my phone as I arrived at the creek, it was 12:20 and there was no hint of any need to return home. I filled some jars with water from the stream and started walking upstream to see if anything else I wanted was around. I saw a few golden chanterelles I harvested and also some fly amanitas I avoided. But for the next hour or so there was nothing else of note, no silence or stalking creatures or odd landmark.

 But that was before I saw the circle.
It was on top of a mostly flat boulder, faded chalk marks made a circle around a core carving which looked like a spiral with some sort of runes around it. The carving was caked in a red-brown substance. As I stood by the circle the air felt off, the gentle breeze stilled and the animals grew silent. This place caught my interest, I scribbled the symbols down in a notebook, a set of five lines pointing away from another line, a branching line which resembled a tree, something that seemed to be a lightning bolt, and a set of curved lines sticking together. I resolved to try and figure out this weird spot, another foolish mistake. 

It took several hours to copy it all down, and the sky was dark with clouds. I could smell the rain coming, I had to get home soon. After all, I was just barely sixteen and got my license barely a month ago. So I rushed down the mountainside with far less caution. I ran past the dilapidated building and the weird tree and the dilapidated building. When I noticed the building for the second time I realized something was off. How did I get turned around in a place I have roamed for since I was twelve and got my first knife. And as I paused I noticed something in the trees, there was a flash of something in between the trees. So again I grabbed my rifle and moved to inspect the area with some muttered prayers. There was again no life but there were some odd symbols on the trees, Forgetting my circumstances I copied them down. But I then remembered my circumstances and slashed through the symbols with my enchanted ritual knife. Then I turned and continued hurrying downhill. Now I got through the flowers and reached my car, a beat up little pickup truck. I quickly placed the deer harvest in the back and tied it down and slipped into the driver’s seat.

As I closed the door I noticed something. It was hidden between a tree but I saw its arm, it clearly bent with at least two joints before it slipped into the dark and it’s six bloody clawed hand held two glassy dark eyes.

I never was one to run. I punched my bully when he was twice my weight as a little girl. I drew a knife on the creep who was following me when I was twelve. I pointed my .22 rifle at the mountain lion that nearly pounced on me during my first hunting trip. And I stood my ground against the spirit which entered my home and terrorized me and my siblings. But this thing was different, I felt my instinct to fight overwhelmed. It was something greater than me, it was powerful, and I was just some squirrel or mouse. I tore out of the little dead end fast enough that I nearly shot off of the road when I came on a turn. 

By the time I got on a road where I may have interacted with another driver my fear had settled, instead of rushing away I focused on every little detail around me, I scanned for any marking or movement. I analyzed every landmark possible. But now as I saw me phone tell me it was 19:00 I was in town. As I pulled into my driveway and started unloading my loot I saw something on the side of the trunk.It was a set of six scrapes.

I rushed to store my loot and then grabbed some chalk from my magical workspace. I scribbled down a pentacle and some protective sigils at the doors and windows. I started to make some spell bottles when my mother caught notice of my erratic behavior.

“Dear, what happened,” She asked. She was well aware that I didn’t react like this normally. When I didn’t respond she continued, “It’s okay dear, what’s going on?”

“Mom I have to set up some protections for the house, something might’ve followed me.” I answered as I placed some iron nails and my blood in a jar and murmured some protective charms before moving onto the next. I spoke up, “Tell the others that this is a ghost thing and to stay put.”

My mother, unsurprisingly, did not take my orders and instead asked a question, “What do you mean by ghost thing?”

As I made my last spell bottle I answered, “I know you don’t believe but there is some sort of spirit which was causing me issues.”

I quickly ran past her into our yard and buried one bottle in each corner of the property and ran back inside. I then heard my siblings scamper out of their rooms.

My older sister, Erin, looked at my disheveled state. She quickly grabbed her own hunting knife and rifle before returning and speaking, “So Amy, what’s happening?”

My younger brother, Jacob, spoke up this time, “Sis what’s happening, I’m scared.”

Following this my little sister, Elizabeth, spoke up, “Yeah, is it another ghost. This time I’ll fight it!”

I was pretty confident before this but now it was a bit more serious. I breathed before speaking, “You all should be fine, remember the charms I made you?” I began, getting a series of nods, “You should be fine if you have them with you. And Liz, you’re too young to fight this one.” This seemed to satisfy my younger siblings and they went back to their room. But Erin stood firm.

“I don’t know anything about magic but this is serious isn’t it.” Erin said, our mother decided to give us some tea and I heard our father settle down next to us in a chair.

I took my tea as I spoke before the older family members, “So I get that you all are probably more concerned so I’ll tell you the important stuff. Essentially there is a spirit or monster in the woods which was stalking me and it scratched my truck and I don’t want to risk you all.”

My family was not satisfied with that but I didn’t give any more information.

Throughout the following week of school and me trying to figure out the magical nonsense I’ve been seeing things, the claw marks, the five fingered sigil, and the other sigils. While I have done my due diligence in destroying them I need to solve this.

This saturday I will go into the woods and seal that thing. No matter what.",61,0.87,4,Decent_Hovercraft556,2024-11-12 19:29:08,1gq1cgs,65,High
NoSleep,I heard my name in the woods,"
Yeah, that’s right. I heard my name in the woods. If you’re Appalachian, you shuttered at the title of this alone. If you’re not, I’ll explain. 

My grandfather went to be with the Lord a few years ago now. He grew up in a small wooden shack a mile off the road. There’s a small Hellfire Brimstone Pentecostal church off the main road. We attended there a few times with him for revivals but often times we would park there and walk to his small house. Along the road he would tell us all kind of spooky stories, which I’ll perhaps share one day. He also told us about all kinds of stories through his life, about his parents, and what it was like growing up in such harsh conditions.

The conditions I’m talking about is probably what you expect to hear coming from poor southerners in Appalachia. No power, cooking only over an open fire, etc. He also told us about how he would stuff hay through the cracks of the wood to try to provide some insulation against the harsh winters. The cabin wasn’t much, probably 150-200 sq ft. There were two bedrooms, and by that I mean one very large room where the family would gather/eat/bathe/ and the kids would sleep. The second room was where his parents slept. 
Along the creek bed near his house, there was a fresh spring you could get water, and there was a house attached to a school bus, where his uncle lived. 

It’s been years since I had visited the house. Occasionally we would have family meals out there for a picnic, bringing friends to come see the place. Some land disputes got in the way as the land had been split and divided and drug addicts had got in the mix. Grandpa went up there often during the last few years of his life to tear down fences people put up trying to keep us out. 

During those walks my brother and I used to take with Grandpa, he told us all kinds of superstitions, many of which I hold today. Examples would be to not show my teeth to a writing spider or to close an open pocketknife. He also would tell me about things like…hearing your name in the woods. In the words of Grandma, “there are haints and boogers in the woods”. 

I was visiting Grandma lately and we were talking about Grandpa and the old cabin, and I got the itch to just go sit there for a bit and think. See Grandpa really was the greatest man I knew. I figure maybe if I could go sit on the steps to the old cabin, I could have some form of communion with him. 

Now I didn’t make it clear at the beginning of this post, the road into the cabin was somewhat accessible in a vehicle, provided you have a 4WD, which I did, but it make more sense to me now why we always walked it. Grandpa wanted us to have that quality time. So when I got off the main road, I parked my SUV at the church, thinking back on the times I’d see Grandpa lifting his arms and praising Jesus, about how the first girl I had ever loved used to go there, and how the preacher man would be running around the congregation feeling that Pentecostal fire. 

Getting out the car, I took a slow walk to the cabin. I enjoyed hearing the acorns under my boots pop and the leaves crunching, a few birds tweeting their familiar songs, and the water from the creek a short ways yonder. 

When I made it to the cabin, I had a bag of mixed emotions, I suppose. I missed Grandpa a whole lot, I was angry that the methheads who lived nearby had littered the cabin with drink bottles, and I was bothered by the men who thought they should “restore” the property when all they did was take away the character of the place my Grandpa loved. 

I went by the creek and there it was familiar. The school bus was still there, there was a bicycle wheel stuck in the ground that Grandpa would put a stick in when he was a young boy and roll around the property, and I filled my water bottle with some of that spring water. As far as I was concerned, that was holy water.  

After kneeling down for a quick prayer and let a small cry out, I decided it was time to make it back to my car. That’s when I heard it….”Phillip”. 

It was almost a whisper. Surely I hearing things, nightfall wasn’t too far away and I brushed it off as a small fear. But then again man’s voice, “Phillip”. I now noticed I couldn’t hear squirrels rustling in the leaf piles or the birds chirping.

I tried to think, that wasn’t any of my family’s voices. Grandma was the only one who knew I came here and she isn’t the kind of woman to use a phone to tell family I had came by the old house. It couldn’t have been any of the tweakers that lived on the edge of the property, none of them would know my name. 

“Phillip”, came a tone that was giggling and somewhat sinister. 

This was it, this is what my grandparents had told me about. These were haints and boogers trying to get me. I never knew what they meant by “get me” but I sure didn’t want to find out. 

I paced quickly towards the car, mind you it’s only about a 15 minute walk. 10 if I jog. 

“Phillip…….Phillip…..PHILLIP”, the haint screamed. 

My now I started jogging, this would save some time, and the sun was setting. 

“Phiiiiiiiiiilip” came up the noise, like how a man will jokingly make the vibrato that a female opera singer has. 

Lord only knows why I turned, I broke the rule and acknowledged it. “Who is there”, I asked. 

“Phillip. Phillip, Phillip. Phillip. PHIIIIILIP”. 

I closed my eyes and slapped myself a couple times, I was going crazy. None of this could be real.

Then I saw…something standing about 50 yards from me. It was the size of a short man, and he had on a devil mask and cape. Very cartoonish, like something someone would buy for Halloween. Holding one of those plastic red pitchforks. 

A distorted mangled voice came from it, howling and laughing. “Oh ho ho Phillip”. 

I know what you’re thinking, run. And that’s what I did. I ran. I only had maybe a quarter mile left to the car, I ran like never before and his thing was hot on my trail. 

“Phillip” it sang out, “Phillllllip, Phillip. Phillip”, it cheered as it tackled me from behind. It quickly flipped me on my back and started digging into me. They were not hands…..they were claws. Skinnier than a nun’s finger and sharper than nail it drove both into my chest, scratching me all up and down and singing my name, continuously. 

The primal noises that came from it and gleeful cheers mixed with the fast breathing of my name had to have echoed the woods. It eventually wrapped the claws around my throat. 

“Shhh Phillip huehuehue”. I could see the strain in its eyes and the pure hate this booger had. I chokingly reached for anything I could get and I managed to get a rock. With any strength I had in me, I swung the rock into its head. Plastic didn’t crumple from a Halloween mask though, the rock caused a bludgeoned dent, like when you know you hear bone get hit through paper skin. 

As it rolled off me to howl , I managed to catch my breathe and get up. There I ran as hard as I could, there wasn’t much, I could see the car and the church. It took one last tackle at me and scraped my ankle on its way down, but I did it. I made it to the church parking lot. 

The creature stopped where it was and wouldn’t enter the lot. It just kept stomping. Stomping and saying, “Come back Phillip, come back. Come back Phillip, come back. We need you Phillip”. 

I climbed in my car and took off down the road, watching it dance by the moonlight in a circle with 3 others just like it. ",76,0.98,11,Grandaddyspookybones,2024-11-12 16:44:08,1gpxsn1,87,High
NoSleep,"I'm A Contract Worker For A Secret Corporation That Hunts Supernatural Creatures... Seriously, don't try to summon monsters. ","[First:](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fz6zph/im_never_doing_door_to_door_sales_again/)

[Previous ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fz6zph/im_never_doing_door_to_door_sales_again/)

My arms had been taking a beating recently. The tainted magic had finally fully gone through my systems but now my left arm wasn’t healing as fast as I could have liked. It hurt like a bitch but I was glad I still had it. It could have been ripped off on the last job.. I wondered if Ito had gotten his arm replaced yet.

August sent me a screenshot of a job demanding we did it together. I debated the offer. Having backup was good however I didn’t know if I had the energy to deal with him that day. The longer I took to answer him the more texts came in. I caved and said yes. Within the next few hours, I found myself at the start of a hiking trail waiting for him to arrive.  

In recent years supernatural creatures have started to migrate to cities. It was easier access to food sources if they were the type able to blend in with humans. The monsters that stayed in the forests were either more animalistic or focused more on traditions. I wasn’t looking forward to whatever waited in the woods. It could be anything from a werewolf to an ancient creature beyond human understanding.   

August arrived late. He said he was having trouble finding a babysitter he trusted. Lucas was in a kindergarten program. Most of the time August didn’t work when Lucas was awake and at home. Lately, he has been having issues finding jobs that fit within school hours. He didn’t mind working at night and would often go two days without sleeping. Most of the time Evie didn’t mind staying overnight at his place to make sure Lucas was fine. But she was often busy during the day. He’s started to have limited options for babysitters now that I was working more.  

When he walked over, he raised a cooler bag to show off.  

“Lucas helped make us lunch.” He said proudly.   

I’ll admit that was pretty cute and worth waiting for.   

We walked down the trail to find the reported site. August happily talked about Lucas. The pain in my arm kept me from adding much to the conversation. Soon we found ourselves at a recently used cult summoning site. Or something along those lines. A circle with Latin words had been drawn around the campfire in red paint. The area was covered with burnt-out candles and feathers. Countless messy footprints were left behind in the dirt leading off into the woods. Instead of getting down to investigating, August sat on a fallen tree lunch bag on his lap. He patted the wood next to him causing me to raise an eyebrow.  

“Now?” I asked.  

He kept patting me until I sat down. I suppose there was no rush getting this job done. We had hours of sunlight left. He opened the bag and handed me a messily made sandwich. He ate some carrot sticks as we silently took our break. I’ve seen him eat raw meat and vegetables. And a person’s brain. He couldn’t eat processed food or spices. I heard he was sick for a full day trying a single chicken nugget.   

He pulled out an orange and offered it to me when I finished the sandwich. My hand had gotten crumbs on it, so I reached out to my other one to take what he offered. A burst of pain shot up my arm and I dropped the orange after picking it up. He caught it but didn’t hand it back. Instead, he started to peel it.  

“I can peel my own orange.” I told him reaching out again but using my good hand.   

“Is another person doing this for you emasculating?” He replied, not even looking up.  

“A little.” I said in a serious tone even though I was joking.  

“I’ve always found the idea of men not accepting help a bit silly. Your species is weak. You have only gotten this far because you rely on others. The pyramids weren’t made by a single person, so take help when you can get it.”  

He held out the peeled orange, with a dimpled smile on his face. I took it from him. Even though he was a man-eating monster I thought it was a good thing he adopted Lucas. I had a feeling the kid would turn out alright. I glanced over to see August split his face for half a second to make his mouth wide enough to fit two large oranges into his mouth. Lucas would be an odd kid, but a good one with this monster as his father.   

After our lunch break, we got up to look around. I hunched over to look over the circle to see it wasn’t all Latin. Some words humans may assume to be random scribbles had been mixed in. I didn’t know Latin aside from a word or two, so I didn’t know what the person had been trying to do.   

“What do we have here?” August asked after he let me look things over for a few minutes.  

“This was most likely done by humans.” I pointed out.  

“How can you tell?” He pressed getting down to my level.  

August had done way more jobs than me. He should know the answer. I considered this was a test.  

“It wasn’t written in the common language supernatural creatures use. But it’s close enough. They were able to write a word or two by chance. There have been thousands of years of misinformation about how spells and magic work from it being suppressed from humans. Because of that, most people think spells need to be found in human skin-bound books written in blood. If you have clear wording and enough magic to power the spell, you can use any language.”  

I stood up and shoved my hands into my pocket to keep away the chill. August ran a finger over the red paint as if testing it.   

“Why do creatures always tend to use the common language then? I know a few of them have been brought up in the human side of things and maybe English would be easier for them to use.”  

I narrowed my eyes at him. He knew the answer. So why bother to check if I did?   

“The common language doesn’t have double meanings for words. It has a crap ton of words but they all mean one thing. English isn’t always like that. Read is a good example. Like Hey, read this or I’ve read that. If a word has two meanings, the magic doesn’t decide on the more logical one. It picks one and you end up with a result you don’t want, or the spell backfires because the magic didn't have a clear path to act on.”   

August nodded along and played dumb. Or maybe he really didn’t know all of this. Not all creatures used spells. I’ve only seen him use his claws and teeth. You didn’t even need to use a spell to make magic do what you wanted. It took longer to write it out, but spells focused the power more efficiently into the task. Magic is a creature’s life force. Using less in a fight to get the job done was key to staying alive.  

“You seem to know a lot about this kind of stuff, but you’re not overly strong.” August commented.  

I should be offended by that. I did enough up beaten and bruised by the end of every job. The pain in my left arm proved his point.  

“My mother hunted down monsters. I’ve always been around supernatural creatures. We moved a lot, and I didn’t go to school as much as I should. Because of that, my only choice was to be a contract worker after my mother died.” I said with a shrug.   

“What about your father?” He asked looking me over.  

“He was human. A biker, I think. My mother said it was a one-night stand. She always wanted kids but only got me. She always said how lucky she was to have me considering her health problems. My life with her was rough but not bad enough that I need therapy.”  

“You totally need therapy.” He said without missing a beat.  

I shoved his shoulder. Even though he looked thin, I couldn’t make him move a millimeter.   

“What about you? Here you are asking for my tragic backstory without giving yours.” I said offended but not expecting him to actually tell me.  

“My clan lived in some mountains. Suddenly cabins started to be built near us for a new tourist ski town. A few of the older generation saw it as free food. Contract workers got wind of it and took out my entire village. I accepted this leash to stay alive. I bounced around for a while before finally landing in Evie’s care.”   

He moved his head show off the black ring around his neck. His voice sounded steady, but I was still kicking myself for asking him such an insensitive question. Not only did he most likely have to watch his loved ones be killed, but he was also caught and forced to work with the people who murdered his family. I looked away with a bad taste in my mouth.  

“Humans and supernatural creatures are not meant to interact. The moment those humans stepped foot on our mountain meant death for both of us. If we keep working together, the day may come when one of us needs to turn on the other. You seem to know a decent amount about creatures, so it won’t be a one-sided fight.” He said in a rather calm tone.  

I looked back over to him letting the words run through my head. We did try to kill each other when we first met. And then I stabbed him again in the cave mostly trying to save my own life. If he went feral, could I kill him? I brought my attention to the empty lunch bag by the fallen tree.  

“What about Lucas?” I asked.  

He looked down at the ground as he gripped his hands together. This thought had come across his mind more than once. He was a monster raising a human. That fact never left his mind since he adopted the poor kid.  

“I would never do anything to hurt him on purpose. I would rather die. But because of what I am... I’ll cause him pain. He may end up hating me. Until then, I’ll treasure the moments of us together.”  

I faintly remember my mother saying the same thing to me when I was younger. Her lifestyle wasn’t ideal for raising a child, but she didn’t have any other way to live. She knew she was going to die young or even drag me into her kind of life, but she didn’t regret the time we had together. It may be the reason why I never disliked the life we had, aside from not being able to finish high school to get a real job to stay afloat.   

August knew his time was limited with Lucas. He would either die on one of these jobs, or his adopted son would finally find out what kind of person was raising him. Could he deal with that information? How can you deal with finding out your parent isn’t human?   

“It is a bit random you want us to talk like this.” I commented wondering if he had some ulterior motives.  

“I was just trying to waste some time.” He admitted.  

I heard the sound before my brain registered what happened. August lifted his hand to block a bullet from going through my skull. His hand transformed into a claw with a protective shell. The shards of the bullet fell to the ground. He was moving before I even caught up to what was going on. I followed behind, pulling out a dagger I rented for this job. Another shot rang out from the tree line. My shoulder felt hot but I didn’t stop moving. Since I grabbed the dagger with my left hand the hidden attacker assumed that was my dominant hand. The left side was already useless and I baited the bullet from going into my good shoulder.  

I heard a scream as August found his target. I got through the bush to see him sitting on the chest of someone dressed in a black robe. He pinned the man’s arms to the ground but hadn’t yet harmed him.   

“You were shot.” August pointed out.  

“I’ll recover. Who’s this?”  

Blood dripped down my arm from the shoulder wound. It hurt. A lot. But I pushed it to the back of my mind and took hold of the dagger in my other hand.   

“From the smell of things, he was the one sacrificing the chickens and spray-painted the spell circle.”   

There were traces of red paint on the bottom of the dirty robes and some feathers sticking to the sleeves. While still pinning the man down, August took away the gun to hand it to me. He did a quick pat down to confirm the stranger wasn’t holding any more weapons. The man struggled; face flushed from being manhandled.   

“Get the fuck off me! I didn’t do anything wrong!” He shouted out of breath from August sitting on his chest.   

“You messed around with magic. That’s dangerous. Depending on what you did, you might only get a warning.” I told him a bit glad this looked to be an easy job.  

“Go to hell! I’ll never snitch on my beloved!”  

I made eye contact with August. He had the same idea. Most of the time spell circles were made by humans to summon whatever false God they believed in, or people with a monster fetish trying to get a partner that would end up eating them. If he brought a dangerous creature into this world, we needed to know what it was. But the whole summoning of a God idea wasn’t off the table. It was much easier than you would think to drag one into this world.   

I was above to press the man further for answers but froze when August changed tactics. He pinned the other man’s wrists above his head in a way I’ve only seen in slightly edgy romance novels. His face dropped in close to take a deep breath near the stranger’s neck causing the other man to let out a surprised squeak. It was so embarrassing to watch I almost told him to stop.  

“The creature you summoned is very lucky. You have a nice smell about you. It’s too bad we didn’t meet before now.”  

I didn’t hide my disbelief. August was flirting. He pulled out every ounce of charm and this guy was about to take the bait.   

“I... You won’t get me to turn on my beautiful future wife.” He said with a weak voice.  

Suddenly August changed his face. It slightly split into four revealing the monstrous insect he hid under his human mask. I’ve never seen it so clearly. Most of the time he only partially showed it, or dropped his mask monster before it was buried into flesh. The front was divided by a cross. He opened each segment wide enough to swallow an entire human head in one bit. Countless sharp teeth lined each segment. He then closed his face, it shifting to something a little more human. His mouth was still wide with needle-sharp teeth. His now black eyes were extra-long appearing half-closed as if he was smiling. They shone in a way that reminded me of an oil spill. I thought he did this to scare the man into speaking. I soon realized the terrifying face had the opposite effect.  

A strangled sound came from the man, his face a deep shade of red.  

“Gross.”  

I tried not to judge people for their preferences. But this guy was drooling over August of all people. He needed way better standards.   

“We just need to know if your future wife is dangerous. Why don’t you introduce us to her?” August suggested in his sweetest voice.   

Well, as sweet as he could sound. With his mask dropped his voice picked up a different tone. The words sounded harder as if he found it difficult to speak. He leaned in more to whisper something I unfortunately heard.  

“How about we ask her if you two will consider an open marriage?”  

The excited noise was the answer we needed. August let the man get up off the ground, tripping over his own feet ready to bring us to whatever monster he dragged into our world. I was horrified that the strategy worked. August gave me a thumbs-up behind the man's back and I didn’t return it. We followed behind and the man introduced himself and Joey. He looked around my age. He brought his hood down to show off long messy red hair and a face nearly covered with freckles. He was shorter, trying to grow out a patchy beard, and had crooked front teeth. I didn’t think he was overly unattractive. Just normal looking. I wondered if he had bad luck with dating so turned to summoning a monster wife instead.  

“She’s a bit hard to handle to start with. I swear she’s not dangerous. Just misunderstood.” He told us as we walked through the wood.  

“Honey! It’s safe, can you come out and see us?” Joey called out into the woods.  

“Honey!” August joined in and I punched his arm.  

He smiled with a row of sharp teeth clearly enjoying acting like a dumbass. He needed to take these jobs more seriously. I knew if I told him he would dismiss my concerns. I found out I preferred him goofing off compared to what else I had to deal with.   

A loud sound came from behind us as something large dropped from the trees. A strained expression came over August. He froze in his tracks staring over my shoulder.  

“Honey! There you are!” Joey said excited to see the monster behind us.  

I finally looked to see what had stopped August in his tracks. I understood why Joey fell for this monster. She was beautiful. From the waist up. Long deep blue hair that was almost black hid half her face. Dark eyes with glowing red pupils were set in my direction. Long fangs ready to rip flesh peeked from her mouth. Her lower body was that of a massive spider, making her twice my height. Aside from some webbing she wrapped around her chest, she wore no clothing.   

Extra arms sprouted from her back, each with a long curved black blade. I got my dagger ready but I knew I was outmatched in this fight. For a pretty face, she was scary as hell. She proved just how frightening she was when her mouth opened. Large fangs come out as well as an ear-piercing scream.   

August was useless. His legs gave out from under him. My body was full of fear and I wanted to join him cowering on the ground but I pressed on. I pushed us out of the way before a sharp blade came down on us. I felt the bottom half of my new thrifted jacket get cut off. I rolled in the dirt avoiding a shower of blades. Thankfully Honey was going after the moving target and not the shell-shocked insect creature. My mind was racing, and fear hammered in my chest. What could I do? Joey was begging Honey to stop without any success. Whatever spell that brought her here must have made it so she couldn’t kill the one who summoned her. Or she didn’t care enough to do so. My weapon wasn’t enough to take her down. And I couldn’t leave August behind. Joey can go off and get eaten for all I care. I bet he would enjoy that.   

The blades sliced through thick trees I tried to hide behind. I narrowly avoided getting crushed by one as I ran. I took a huge risk to slide under her large body, my arm throbbing in pain. I didn’t try to stab her knowing her spider body would be too hard for my knife. I got up and went over to August. I took his arm hauling him back to his feet. His face was a blank mask staring off into space. I wanted to force him to run but it was too late.  

A blade came down on us and I raised my own on reflex. The spider monster was stronger and had a larger weapon and more skill. I should have been cut in half. For some reason, I lived through the attack.   

A sharp pain came in my left leg, and then the hand I had in August started to burn. A white-hot feeling shot through my veins straight to the knife in my hand. When the blades clashed, a burst of power exploded outwards shattering them both. A shard of metal cut August across his face snapping him from his trace. A large piece of Honey’s weapon shot back towards her chest. It cut through the webbing she had used as a tight cloth but bounced off her hard skin. I jerked my burning hand back ready to make a run for it.  

My legs refused to work. My entire body hurt so much I couldn’t move. By sheer luck, Honey had some modesty. She let out a shocked sound and covered herself with her many arms. Then she rushed back off into the trees to recover.  

“Feel free to step in to help at any time.” I hissed at August.  

He gave me a thumbs up I rolled my eyes at.  

“And you! What the hell were you thinking summoning a dangerous creature here!” I shouted at Joey.  

He had a dazed look on his face. He acted as if he had watched something completely different than a fight to the death.  

“Dangerous? I thought that was how she uh... got things going. I was worried she fancied you over me.” He admitted.  

I gritted my teeth. There had to be a limit to how stupid someone could be. If he wanted to die trying to get with a monster, he should have found a way to go to them instead of bringing one here.   

I took stock of the situation. When Honey came back, August was useless against her. My body was too worn out to fight and Joey had stars in his eyes when he looked at the monster that attacked us. Whatever stroke of luck that shattered the blades wouldn’t happen again. If it did, I would die. Simple as that. I needed another way out of this.  

I heard Honey stalking through the trees before I saw her. I kept a tight hold on August's arm in case we had a chance to run. She came out of the darkness, new webbing over her chest and all her arms ready. When I took a step closer to her, she tensed up. She didn’t know how I shattered the blades. I was human and yet I showed an odd power I shouldn’t have. It freaked her out a little.   

“Can we just talk?” I offered to try to break this stalemate.  

She slowly put away her extra arms with the weapons. She got closer, arms crossed ready to hear what I had to say.   

“I don’t want to fight you and I bet you don’t want to waste time either. We only showed up here because of the signs someone summoned a creature recently. If you want to get back home, The Corporation can arrange that. If you want to stay here, you need to register with them.” I explained.  

“And submit myself to them? No, I’ve heard of their ways.” She huffed in a voice that sounded as sweet as her name.  

“Why would she need to register with someone?” Joey asked stepping into this conversation.  

Honey beat me to answer.  

“They are nasty things keeping all supernatural creatures under their control. Step one hair out of line and they kill off your entire species. They favor humans in conflicts and on top of all that they claim their actions are approved by The Silver King! As if our King would let so many of us be slaughtered by Agents for the benefit of humans!”  

Her words weren’t entirely untrue. August was proof of that. His village had been killed when they refused to let humans on their land. If anyone here had a reason to agree with Honey, he would.  

“No, I refuse to be a part of such a horrid company. I’ll stay in this world proving my strength. I’ll bring my family name honor. I cannot let go of any more of my pride after I let a man see my bare chest before marriage.” She said as she tightened her arms covering her chest.  

“If it makes you feel any better I didn’t see anything.” I told her.  

Joey felt better by those words. August turned his head, an odd emotion on his face.  

“Who cares about pride and honor. All it does is shorten your life.” He spoke in a bitter voice.  

“And what would an insect like you know about that?” Honey narrowed her eyes down at him.  

“Even insects have reasons to live. For my elders, it was the pride they had in their mountain. We could have left for an entirely different world with a better way of life, but they claimed we needed to honor our history. That stubbornness killed everyone. I’m still alive by sheer luck. There is no honor in a painful lonely death.”  

I wasn’t expecting August to say any of that. He got past his fear of spiders to make eye contact with Honey challenging her to answer.   

“And what do you suppose I do then? Become a slave like yourself?” She hissed.  

“What do you want out of life?” He replied in a calm voice.  

The question made Honey take a step back on her many legs. She had never had anyone ask her such a question let alone let herself even consider such a thing. For most creatures, their lives were already planned out for them. She had expected to be strong, produce offspring, or die fighting. There had never been any other options.  

“That doesn’t factor into-” She sputtered.  

“It does. You’re on your own right now. I doubt your family or any of your species is going to come here looking for you. They won’t hear about if you decide to stick to what you’ve been taught, or if you do something different. However, there are limits to your freedom because you’re a supernatural creature. If you start fights, the Corporation will catch wind of it. They’ll send Agents to deal with you. If you kill too many humans for food that will also cause Agents to track you down. If you register with The Corporation, they’ll ensure you have a home and a steady food source in exchange for what you're willing to give. It could be your silk, your magic, or just doing some filing in an office if you can read.”  

“Wait, seriously?” Joey asked in disbelief.  

“Pretty much.” I shrugged.  

There was a little bit more to it all. This offer was only extended to sentient creatures. Monsters like the undead piles of bones I’ve fought before were seen as a threat to be killed. But I knew about a few cryptid-like creatures that were allowed certain number of human deaths per year. Even the ones who registered with The Corporation that needed to eat humans to live were given just enough to survive. The entire system was... messy. Only the head of The Corporation knew the reasoning behind why some monsters could eat how many people per year and why some creatures were killed on sight. I was paid by them, but I wasn’t officially working for them. It wasn’t my place to question the system. It appeared to be working though. For the most part, humans and creatures lived together on a very thread between the two worlds always threatening to break.   

“I do not have as many options as you first suggested. I should just kill the both of you and run off like I had planned. No need to worry about honoring my family name or being under the heel of another using my body for goods. I could have true freedom.”  

Sweat started to form at the base of my neck. From the sounds of things, that option was what she wanted to pick.  

“It would be a short-lived freedom.” August told her.  

It wasn’t a threat but the truth. If we died here, then they would send out Agents to take care of her. We were nothing compared to an Agent. I thought about cute little Ito and mentally corrected myself. We were nothing compared to most Agents.  

“If you do that, I’m coming with you.” Joey spoke up,  

“Don’t be silly. They would kill you too. Walk away now and you’ll just get a slap on the wrist.” Honey waved off his offer.  

“I was the one who summoned you. When we met, I told you the truth. I’m going to be with you till the end. I’ve loved you since I saw your face and will do anything to make you happy.”  

For a moment, he sounded pretty convincing. Honey appeared unmoved by his gentle words.  

“Anything like drooling over the first creature you see when I’m not around? Hmm? Or getting excited by an open marriage offer?”  

That was a little embarrassing she saw all that. She looked annoyed that Joey was so easily taken. He quickly got on his hands and knees then pressed his forehead in the dirt as an apology.   

“I’m sorry! I just felt like I was a worm! There is no way you could care about a pitiful thing like myself. I got carried away from the positive attention. But I truly thought you might like a second partner. You should go with him instead of me. I’m only good for stepping on.”  

This... was even more embarrassing. The sight hurt to watch. I needed to look away. A chill ran down my back as I did everything in my power to suppress what I just saw.   

Honey extended one of her pointed spider leg to press into Joey’s back causing him to be forced further into the dirt. He was totally into it. I regretted asking her to talk. A blade to the stomach would be better than seeing this.  

“It was a bold thing of a little worm like you to offer to throw away your life for me. What else would you do?” She pressed harder.  

“I’ll give you anything. I’ll worship you.” Joey said his words slightly muffled by the dirt.  

“What if eat your insides while you’re still alive? Or if I bring you along and make you watch as I take a different partner? What would you do then?”  

Joey raised his head enough to let their eyes meet. I’ve never seen someone with such an honest expression before.   

“I’ll do whatever makes you happy. I’ll give you my life or my body. If you want neither of those it would be nice to be friends. I brought you here. The least I can do is get to know you. So, what do you want from me?”  

Honey brought her leg back after his last question. She suddenly appeared lost. No one had ever asked her what she wanted in life. Being happy was never something she considered. As much as she hated the idea of it, if she went along with The Corporation’s deal, she had the chance to figure out answers to questions she never even thought of before.  

Finally, it appeared as if we wrapped up this job.   

Things are never that easy. Something hit my back hard. I landed on the ground scrambling to stand up. I threw off whatever landed on me, then raised the gun I stole from Joey at the attacker. I screamed when I saw a spider the size of a dog staring at me with red eyes and dripping fangs, I fired the gun, blowing apart half the spider’s head. They looked scary as hell but not that strong if a bullet took care of one. My entire body itched and I was jumpy from the fear of there being more of those things around.   

My stomach dropped when I realized I just killed a spider in front of Honey.  

“I uh...” I started my mouth dry.  

“That was one of my siblings. They’re assholes, don’t worry about it. They must have come through the same way I did but only came out now because the sun is getting lower.”  

At least she was on my side. Another spider went for her leg. She was faster and impaled it with the tip of her leg and pushed it off with another. I started to notice more of the red eyes in the trees. August had frozen in place again. I couldn’t count on him in this fight. I quickly emptied the gun. No matter how many I killed, two more took its place.  

We would be eaten in minutes if we didn’t do something soon. A black curved blade landed at my feet. I gave Honey a questioning look.  

“I’ll protect this human, you protect your useless insect. I haven’t fully decided what I want to do. But I’m not going to let these little butt-munchers take me out before I figure out what makes me happy.”  

I suddenly liked Honey. I took the handle of the blade to cut the first spider in half. My body burned and I started to get dizzy. I was in no condition for this fight, but I pressed on. Thank God Honey was tough. She took out a bulk of the spiders leaving me the leftovers she missed. When I was almost about to collapse the smaller creatures suddenly turned tail and ran.  

I wanted them to just run away in fear of their bigger sister but we had no such luck. They were running from a larger sibling that showed itself.

A booming crack rang through the forest followed by a shockwave that nearly knocked me off my feet.  

Creatures could come to our world by summoning. However, if the barrier between the two worlds had been weakened and the monster was strong enough, they could push their way through. 

If August hadn’t frozen up before, he would have been useless now. Even my body wanted to shut down from what I saw through the trees.   

A massive dark shape towered over the treetops. It had the body of a wolf but the legs of a spider. Eight red eyes were set on the head of a wolf. It started a clicking sound that ended in a howl that shook the trees.  

“Shit. My big brother came by. There goes this world.” Honey muttered to herself.  

She was already considering a way of leaving this world to get back to hers.   

Damn it. This sucked. We barely held our own against the smaller spiders and now this? If I called back up, they would not arrive in time to save us. We had minutes before that thing spotted us and brought its fangs down.  

 August was useless. Joey stared at the new monster as if he had just found a playboy in the woods. So, he was more than useless. I couldn’t run and was finding it hard to stand. That left Honey. Anyone could see she wasn’t on the same level as this beast.   

I counted her blades. Seven including the one in my hand.   

“Do you want to stay in this world to try and find your happiness?” I asked her. 

She glances between the beast and Joey. She nodded which made me let out a sigh of relief. I had a plan, but I wasn’t sure if it would work.  

“How fast can you produce silk?” I asked her.  

“Very.” She nodded.  

“How fast can you run?”   

“Super fast.”  

“Can the tip of your leg grow back?”  

She nodded a bit confused.  I just needed someone to distract the wolf spider long enough to get our plan into motion. If Joey did it, he would die too fast. To my shock, August moved. In a blur he had raced into the forest towards the massive monster. Its eyes started to follow him, and it brought some long legs down trying to kill him. Good thing August was able to run faster when it came to spiders.  

With my heart in my throat, I told Honey what she needed to do. We had everything arranged in under two minutes. Either August had been squished to death, or the wolf spider got bored. It turned its eyes in our direction. Without any more hesitation, I told Honey to get started.   

She had made seven slings for her blades out of silk. When she cut one thread, the tension was broken causing each blade to get shot forward cutting down anything in their path. They hit their target, each blade exploding into a burst of magic she placed inside the weapons. The blasts landed on the wolf’s face, two of the smaller eyes were blinded by the attack. We knew it wouldn’t be enough to take it down. That was where my dumb idea came in.  

We needed it to be distracted long enough to not see Honey throwing me as hard as she could at the monster. I held the long-pointed end of one of her legs as if I were jousting in midair. Her aim hit exactly where was needed it to. The leg sank in deep into one of the monster’s eyes causing it to roar out in pain. I let go, rolling down the creature's large face, and then towards the ground. We attached a thread to the piece of torn-off leg now buried in the monster's eye. The thin piece of strong silk connected the pair just long enough. When I was out of the way she shot through as much magic as she could. The power fired directly through the injured eye and inside her big brother's brain.   

The only way to kill most creatures was to hit it with magic on the inside. Another stroke of luck was the beast fell the opposite way I did. Honey jumped to snagged my body with some webbing before I died from hitting the ground. Still, the sudden stop from falling in midair was enough to make me black out.  

I wasn’t certain how much time had passed. I woke up in a dark room. Fumbling for the lights, my head hurting almost as much as my left shoulder. I knew this room. The Corporation had many offices. Each one had identical treatment rooms for people getting off jobs who needed to rest after minor injuries. While I was blacked out someone had treated the bullet wound in my shoulder. I was thankful for that but dreaded how much they would take out of my pay for the service.  

I walked out to the lobby when  August came out of the interview rooms. He smiled and made his way over.  

“Do you want to go in and give a debrief or do you want to put it off? The three of us already finished ours.” 

Most of the time we only were required to do reports by email. When things like a huge ass wolf spider breaking through into our world happened, an in-person report was requested.   

“I’ll get it over with.” I sighed.  

The room was simple. One table, two chairs. A man greeted me when I entered. A plate of baked goods and juice was pushed my way. I had never met this person before. I assumed he was an Agent at one point. He lacked a suit jacket but was dressed in a tie and white pressed shirt. His hair was grey and neatly cut. He kept his hands folded on the table on top of some folders of paper. His hands were covered in scars. His face wasn’t much different. Four deep claw marks ran down his face from his forehead to his chin. The scars tore through his lips revealing teeth giving him a grim smile. His eyes were kind and I found myself able to relax as I sat down.  

We went over everything that happened as he wrote down what I said. His voice was soft with some sort of accent I couldn’t place. He didn’t have any issues talking despite his exposed teeth aside from the occasional sharp inhale after a sentence.   

“What’s going to happen to Honey and Joey?” I asked when we were finally finished.

“We’re still talking that over with them. So far Honey has not displayed any signs of aggression towards humans, besides yourself of course. We’re letting them choose what they would like to do.”  

She didn’t actually have a lot of choices. Go back to her world and be unhappy or deal with a company she hated.   

“How did Joey do all this?”

He didn’t seem to how the power to make such a mess. My interviewer looked through his papers to double-check some information.  

“It seems as if he found out the summoning ritual over... Discord? Whatever that is. There are a few humans recklessly sharing some dangerous information. Another group summoned some female Hyena creatures. They were devoured but we’re not faulting the Hyena’s. We returned all but one to where they came from. That one wanted a job with us. Now, knowing how to summon these creatures is the first part. You must have the power to follow through. Joey burned a dagger that had been in his family for generations unaware it held true magic. The men who summoned the Hyenas sacrificed a virgin.”  

My head felt heavy. Because that group wanted some hot monster girlfriends, a person was dead. I was glad I didn’t eat any of the offered treats when I entered the room. Bile rose to the back of my throat and I felt so very tired.  

“Monsters and humans should never interact with each other.” I muttered to myself.  

“You think so?” The interviewer asked, his smile pushing back most of my negative thoughts. “I’ve seen a lot happen between creatures and humans. Despite it all, I think there are good moments. After all, I enjoyed talking with you.”  

He pushed the tray closer to make me take a cup of juice. The sugar washed down some bitterness. This guy was smooth. It must be part of his job to be so charming.  

“I would suggest you take some time off. You got battered from today. I would like to dismiss you but I... want to ask a personal question.” He said with a sharp inhale through his scars.  

I raised an eyebrow wondering what on Earth he would want to ask.  

“Why did you ask Honey to throw yourself with her leg? Surely the leg was sharp enough to pierce the eye. Did you need to risk your life like that?”   

I felt a redness come to my face. I chugged down the rest of my drink and started stuff my pockets with cookies and muffins.  

“I thought the extra weight would push the leg deeper down! It was a good plan!” I defended myself.  

“I'm not saying it wasn’t a good plan...”   

He held a serious face for a moment then he needed to raise a hand over his mouth to cover up his laughter.   

“I lived therefore it was a good plan! I'm leaving now Mr. Know it all!” I said annoyed.  

“My name is Klaus. I hope we don’t need to meet again.”  

His gentle voice and kind face made me pause. Seeing him meant I did a very dangerous job. If I wanted to keep my life, I needed to limit how many times I needed to go into this room for a report.  

“We will.” I told him and stole more baked goods before I left.  

I got home and collapsed in bed. Since we took down such a large monster the pay would be more than normal. I have time to take it easy. A massive debt still hung over my head. No matter what I did it felt like I hadn’t even touched the amount left.  

Just before I fell asleep that night August sent me a text. 

‘Lucas wants a jumping spider as a pet? What should I do?’  

I ran through a few replies but settled on a simple answer.  

‘Man up and get one.’   ",130,0.96,11,02321,2024-11-12 12:51:17,1gps7bi,141,High
NoSleep,End Of Life As We Know'd It,"In Obedient Grove, silence isn’t just the lack of sound—it’s a way of life, a kind of ritual, almost. It lingers in the air, in the way our neighbors nod rather than greet, in the steady tolling of the clock tower. Evelyn and I, we’ve grown accustomed to it. After all, in a place like this, silence can be comforting. Or, at least, that’s what I’ve always thought.

These days, our *quiet* is occasionally softened by the sound of Timmy’s laughter, and, if I close my eyes, I can almost pretend everything is as it was. He doesn’t understand, not fully. To him, this is just a visit to Grandma and Grandpa’s, a long one, perhaps, but temporary. He talks about his mother and father as if they’re right down the road, as if any day now they’ll walk through the door. Evelyn and I haven’t found the strength to correct him, to tell him that he’s here with us for good. Instead, we let him keep his illusions, because a part of me wishes I could still believe it myself.

In the morning, I watched Evelyn braid his hair into cornrows, her hands moving carefully. I think about it now, of Evelyn *smiling* as she sends him off to school with a sandwich and a small treat, watching him skip down the driveway. I know she worries, lingering at the door until he’s out of sight, fearing that, like his parents, he might simply disappear if we don’t watch him close enough. Each night, I read him the same stories we used to read to our daughter, and he falls asleep with his little hand tucked into mine. He’s the last bit of her we have, and I don’t think either of us would survive losing him, too.

The whole town seems to sense it, our need for this fragile new *normal*. The neighbors nod from their porches but rarely speak, lawns are pristine, and at night, the streetlamps all flicker on in perfect unison, a soft, reliable glow against the dark. Obedient Grove cocoons us, as if trying to keep us safe in its quiet embrace.

There’s a peculiar stillness to this place, something deeper than grief, something unspoken. It presses in, as though the town is watching us, biding its time.

That first night was the first time in a long while that I felt uneasy in my own home. It’s difficult to explain; it sounds almost foolish as I write it down, but the silence here, the stillness—it was different. There was a weight to it, a quiet that pressed down like a presence, as if something else had settled into the house with us.

It started small, just faint noises—a creak on the stairs, the thud of something dropping in the attic, footsteps. Old houses have a way of making their own sounds, so Evelyn and I brushed it off as our imaginations running wild. Still, when I checked on Timmy, I found myself hesitating by his door, lingering just long enough to hear the soft, steady sound of his breathing. He was fast asleep, oblivious to the unease seeping through the walls.

But the noises didn’t stop. At one point, I could’ve sworn I heard someone—or something—whispering from the corner of the room, but when I looked, it was only shadows flickering, shifting along the wallpaper. Just a trick of the light, I told myself. But I knew that wasn’t quite true. Evelyn felt it too. I saw it in the way her hands trembled slightly as she closed the curtains, how her eyes darted to the shadows that gathered just beyond the lamplight.

We tried to sleep, to put it out of our minds, but the house refused to let us rest. There were noises—an almost rhythmic tapping along the walls, faint but insistent, and a skittering sound, as though something was crawling through the walls themselves. I remember holding my breath, straining to make sense of the sounds, my heart thudding in my chest. I don’t remember feeling this way since *the accident*—this feeling of something terrible hovering just out of sight, waiting.

Then came the shadows. They seemed to pool in the corners, darkening the spaces between furniture, thickening under the bed. At first, I thought it was just the play of headlights from the street, but the shapes lingered, stretching along the walls and ceiling in ways I can’t explain. And just before dawn, I thought I saw a figure standing in the doorway of Timmy’s room.

When I gathered the courage to look again: there was nothing there.

It was only then, as I lay back down beside Evelyn, that I realized I’d been gripping her hand all along, and that I’d been praying, over and over, that it was only the house settling, that the quiet would return to its familiar, *peacefu*l hum.

But this morning, when Timmy asked why someone was whispering his name during the night, I could feel the truth beginning to creep in: we aren’t alone. Something has shifted, and whatever it is, it’s come to Obedient Grove to make itself known.

The silence in Obedient Grove has always been a comfort to me, a stillness that held the world steady and predictable. But lately, I wonder if it’s something else entirely, something alive, that stirs within the quiet. A force that thrives in the spaces where words go unspoken and thoughts remain nascent. As strange as it sounds, it’s as though the very hush of this town draws out what’s hidden, giving shape to things that should never take form.

It began with Timmy’s sketches. He’s always been fond of drawing—a happy distraction, I’d thought, a way to keep his mind on brighter things. But his drawings have changed. Where once there were smiling stick figures and animals, there are now twisted shapes, creatures that don’t belong in any storybook. Long limbs, eyes that bulge in impossible places, mouths that curl into jagged grin. Evelyn and I exchanged uneasy glances when we saw them, dismissing it as a phase, perhaps, or an outlet for the confusion he must be feeling. But it didn’t stop there.

The first real sign came a few nights ago. Timmy was fast asleep when I heard the patter of footsteps in the hall. Thinking he’d woken up, I went to check, but found only his toys scattered across the floor. They hadn’t been there when we tucked him in. As I reached down to pick them up, one of them—a wooden horse on wheels—let out a faint creak, as if it had moved by itself. I told myself it was my imagination, but the dread lingered, a chill that seemed to seep into the walls

Evelyn and I were sitting in the living room, exhausted and the house was finally still, or so we thought. A faint shuffle behind us broke the silence, something soft and scratchy—just the sound you’d make if you dragged a piece of chalk across the wall in slow, jagged strokes.

I turned, and in that sliver of dim light from the hallway, I saw it. The thing was barely there, a shape that wavered and shifted, like a child’s frantic drawing, come to life and slipping between worlds. It looked like something Timmy had scrawled in crayon on paper, then smudged over in wild streaks—a chimera, but incomplete, sketched in blurry lines that couldn’t hold still. A strange smear of limbs and eyes that almost formed a face but melted away when I tried to focus. It didn’t walk, didn’t crawl, just seemed to blur in and out, as if it were trying to find itself and failing.

It was there, and then it wasn’t. When I blinked, the shape shifted, slipped backward, and vanished. But there was a sickly residue left in my mind, like staring too long at something bright and having the shape burned into your vision.

Neither of us said a word. Evelyn’s hand was cold in mine, her grip unsteady, and I knew she’d seen it too. We couldn’t find words to fill the silence, so we sat there, each of us holding our breath, watching the shadows for any sign that it might reappear. I felt my heart pounding in my ears, the quiet pressing in again, as if the house had sealed itself over that strange, fragile thing.

Hours later, we climbed into bed, but sleep refused to come. I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, wondering if it would slip back into our room while we slept, if it had always been lurking just beyond our sight, waiting.

Morning arrived, but it felt like the earth had tilted slightly, leaving everything off-kilter. The sunlight poured through the windows, but it didn’t warm the room; it only made the shadows sharper, more oppressive, as if they were stretching longer just to remind us of their presence. I watched Timmy sitting at the breakfast table, still as stone, staring blankly at his untouched plate. His hands were curled into fists at his sides, and his eyes—his eyes were distant, hollow, as if he wasn’t really here with us at all.

Evelyn and I didn’t speak. We couldn’t. The silence between us had grown thick, a presence in itself. The kind of silence that makes your skin crawl, the kind that makes you feel like you’re suffocating on your own breath. The house was so still, I could hear my pulse in my ears.

I watched Timmy, my heart hammering in my chest, but I couldn’t bring myself to ask him what was wrong. His stare was empty, unfocused, as if he were seeing something we couldn’t. The air in the room was so dense, so heavy with something unseen, that I couldn’t move. I couldn’t look away.

Evelyn’s hands were trembling in her lap, wringing together like she was trying to hold onto something, trying to stop herself from breaking apart. I could see the same panic rising in her eyes—the kind of panic that comes from knowing something terrible is happening, but not knowing what or when it will strike. Her gaze kept flicking to the shadows in the corners of the room, as if expecting them to move, to shift into something more solid, something...alive.

I couldn’t look away from Timmy, and he couldn’t look away from whatever it was that he saw. The *silence* stretched on, longer than it ever should have, choking us, suffocating us. No words were spoken, not a sound—just the sound of our breaths, too loud in the oppressive quiet. I wanted to scream, to break the silence, but I couldn’t. It felt like the very air would tear if I did.

Timmy didn’t blink. He didn’t move. His hands were still clenched, and he just kept staring at that breakfast plate like it was the most important thing in the world. I wanted to shake him, to make him snap out of whatever this was, but I couldn’t bring myself to touch him. I was terrified that the moment I did, whatever we were avoiding—whatever we were waiting for—would rush back in, filling the room like smoke, like shadows, like something we couldn’t control.

The quiet wasn’t just the absence of noise. It was something more—something alive, suffocating, pressing against us from every side. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from, but I knew it was here, in the house, in the air. The same thing that had haunted us the night before, that had flickered in and out of existence like a smear of ink—now it was everywhere. I felt it creeping up behind me, in the corners of my eyes, where the shadows wouldn’t stop stretching.

Timmy finally blinked. But he didn’t move.

We didn’t move.

The house didn’t move.

And the silence...the silence just kept pressing in, tighter and tighter.

I had to get out of there, and left Timmy and Evelyn to go to the library. I've always got my answers from books. I have an uncanny knack for research and locating information. I had to do something, to find a way through the silence. It was strange that I felt like I was somewhere I didn't want to be, as though the threshold to knowledge were a cold and evil stone slab I had to step over.

I don't know how long I spent in the library—time blurred into something unrecognizable, a tangled mess of hours or perhaps days. The cold stone of the building seemed to press in on me, heavy and oppressive, as if the very walls were conspiring to keep me trapped. I had no idea what I was searching for, but I knew I had to find something—anything—that could explain what had been happening to Timmy. There had to be an answer hidden in the town's forgotten past, some piece of history that could tell me how to protect him.

And then I found it. A single, obscure folktale, buried in a crumbling old book, tucked between forgotten volumes. It wasn’t much—just a few tattered pages, barely legible—but it was enough. The story, something from the earliest days of Obedient Grove, told of a creature, a thing born from a child’s imagination. It had no true form, just a blur of shifting shapes, twisting shadows—like something sketched quickly with crayon, but alive. And it had been summoned by the innocent mind of a child.

The creature, too pure at first, had grown twisted, fed by fear, until it had become a terror that gripped the town for years. The child’s grandparents, it seemed, had been the ones to defeat it. They had used something—an artifact, a weapon of light, something the town’s history had nearly erased. These artifacts, the *Fulgence Illumum*, were the key. The light they wielded was the only force that could push the creature back, banishing it into the darkness, but at a cost.

The cost was unthinkable.

Using the *Fulgence Illumum*, the tale warned, would destroy the child’s imagination—erase it. The very thing that had brought the creature into existence would be destroyed, and with it, the child’s innocence, the very soul of childhood. I read those words, feeling them sink into me like vomit, heavy and suffocating.

But what could I do? The creature was here, in our home, in Timmy’s mind. I saw it every time he stared into space, every time he shuddered and looked over his shoulder. I couldn’t let it consume him. But the price...

I didn’t know what else to do. I couldn’t stop myself.

That’s when I overheard something. One of the librarians, a woman with an unsettlingly quiet voice, had mentioned the library’s restricted cellar. It was off-limits to the public, but there were rumors about what might be kept down there. Strange things. I hadn’t thought much of it until then. But now, in that moment of desperation, I knew where I had to go.

The library had emptied by the time I slipped down the hall, moving quietly through the back corridors, my breath catching in my throat. The air grew damp and cold as I descended the narrow stairs to the cellar, the stone walls pressing in on me as if they wanted to swallow my soul. It was darker than I’d expected, the kind of darkness that makes you feel like the shadows hide something, watching. Shelves lined with dust-covered crates filled the space, each one feeling more ancient than the last.

And then, I found it. A chest, sitting alone in the corner, its wood old and warped with age, covered in strange markings, too faded to decipher. Something in me knew. I felt it in my gut. This was it. This was what I had been searching for.

Inside the chest, the *Fulgence Illumum* lay waiting. Three objects, gleaming faintly even in the darkness: a lantern, its glass glowing from within as if it contained its own heartbeat; a pair of gloves, thin and delicate, woven from a silver thread that caught the faintest light; and a crystal orb, so clear it seemed to absorb the very air around it, casting a thousand tiny, fractured reflections on the walls.

I didn’t need to ask what they were. I knew, somehow. These were the very objects that had been used to banish the creature long ago. The light they held was the only thing that could stop it now. But there was no forgetting the cost. The child’s imagination would burn away. Timmy’s innocence would be gone forever.

I hesitated, standing there in the dark, the artifacts heavy in my hands. The price... the cost was unbearable, but what choice did I have? Timmy couldn’t go on like this, trapped in his own fear. I couldn’t stand to watch him slip further away, lost in that terrible thing that lurked in his mind.

I took the artifacts. My heart raced, my hands trembling as I slipped them into my coat, burying them close to my chest. I didn’t look back as I ascended the stairs, barely breathing as I passed the empty halls, out into the crisp night air.

The weight of what we faced pressed down on us, heavier than anything I’d ever carried. Evelyn and I hadn’t spoken much since I returned from the library, the silence between us thick with the weight of what we were about to do. I could feel it in her eyes—what I felt, too. The fear wasn’t the same as before; it wasn’t just the creature anymore. It had become about Timmy, and the uncertainty of what we had to sacrifice. What would it cost us to protect him?

When Claire and her husband... when they were taken from us, everything changed. The world became a quiet, desolate place. It’s hard to describe, that kind of loss. It’s not like any grief I’ve known, where you can say goodbye, where there’s a sense of closure. No, this was different. It was the suddenness of it that cuts the deepest. One day they were here, full of life, and the next, it felt like they’d never existed. That kind of absence, that void, it doesn’t fill up easily.

And now, in the quiet of this house that used to echo with Claire’s voice, there’s only stillness. The walls are heavy with it, and every corner feels empty. That’s when Timmy came. He wasn’t a replacement for Claire, and I knew he never could be. But he’s a piece of her, a part of this family, and we hoped—maybe foolishly—that his presence could fill just a little bit of the space she left behind. But I don’t think Timmy understands. He still thinks this is just a visit. That one day, everything will go back to the way it was. He doesn’t know that his parents aren’t coming back.

And that breaks my heart. He’s so young, and he’s so lost in all of this. He deserves to know the world isn’t a dark and broken place, that there’s safety and love. But sometimes, I see it in his eyes—the same confusion, the same fear I feel. I wonder if he senses it too. The emptiness, the loss, the way everything’s changed so suddenly, and so completely.

Every time I look at him, I think of Claire. I think of how she would’ve known what to say, how she would’ve made everything feel okay. But she’s not here. And now there’s something else—a creature, a thing born from Timmy’s imagination, his fears, and this quiet town that seems to hold everything in place, like it’s waiting for something to break. It’s feeding on him, growing stronger every day. It’s like watching him slip away, little by little, into something else. Something darker.

I wish I knew what Claire would have done. What she would have said. Maybe she would’ve known how to stop this—how to keep Timmy from fading into something I couldn’t reach. But she’s gone, and I’m left with this fear, this horror, and I don’t know how to fix it.

The *Fulgence Illumum*—these artifacts I found, these light-based objects that can burn away the creature—might be the only hope we have. But there’s a price to using them, a terrible price. If we destroy the creature, we destroy Timmy’s imagination, his innocence. I know it will break him. And I don’t know if I can do that.

But I can’t let him become what this creature wants. Not after all that’s already taken from us. I can’t lose him too.

So we move forward. The ache of Claire’s absence is still fresh, still raw in ways I didn’t expect. Timmy’s only just moved in, but already, it feels like he’s been here forever. And yet, every day, I feel like we’re walking on the edge of something we can’t quite see, waiting for it to take us. We can’t protect Timmy from everything—he’s already lost so much—but I have to try. I can’t let this thing steal him, too. I can’t let him become like this house: empty, quiet, forgotten.

For Claire’s sake, for Timmy’s, we have to face what comes next. Whatever it costs us, we can’t let him slip away into the dark. Not like she did. Not again.

It all happened so fast, too fast—one second, we were standing there, the light flickering in our hands, trying to hold it together, and the next, the creature was *everywhere*. God, I can’t even make sense of it, everything a blur—its body stretching, twisting, *growing*. It didn’t make sense. The walls groaned like they were alive, creaking, cracking, and suddenly the air felt *wrong*, as if the house itself was being torn apart from the inside.

The windows—they exploded outward, and I couldn’t hear myself scream over the shriek that tore through the walls. It wasn’t just screams—it was everything—growls, screeches, tearing metal, cracking bones, all crashing together, a roar that rattled my bones, shook the very ground beneath us.

We had to run. We didn’t even think. We just—ran.

Evelyn grabbed my arm, pulling me toward the door. Timmy was right behind us, his hand clutching mine, and we were stumbling, tripping over our feet, every step leading us farther from that *thing* inside. The floor beneath us groaned, buckling, the house itself seemed to be *caving in*, bending and shifting in ways I couldn’t understand. There was no time to think, just run—run, *get out*—and we did, through the door, into the air that felt cold, wrong, like it had been poisoned by whatever the hell was inside.

And then—*then*—it came. The house… *broke*. The limbs of it *reached*, stretching out from the windows, from the cracks in the walls, like they were made of nothing but air and shadow, barely there, flickering like some half-formed nightmare. It was too much, too fast, too much to even take in—everything splintered and cracked and *flew* outward, shards of wood, glass, the very walls breaking apart, exploding into the air, the wind screaming with the sound of it.

We were running. We didn’t even look back.

The air was full of glass, of splinters, like they were cutting through the world, raining down around us. We didn’t stop. I couldn’t—*we couldn’t*—look back.

But then, for a second, I did.

The house… it wasn’t a house anymore. It was just *pieces*, *fragments*, everything falling apart, bending, warping like it wasn’t meant to be real. The thing—whatever it was—was still there, still *growing*, limbs flailing, stretching outward, impossibly large, and the noise… God, the noise, it was like everything was screaming at once.

And then it exploded.

No, it wasn’t like fire—it was like the world itself cracked open, every bit of it pulled apart and shredded in an instant. The walls, the windows, the floor—*everything*—ripped away, flying outward, and I thought I was going to be torn apart with it. I was holding on to Timmy, holding on to Evelyn, and we ran, *ran*, just trying to get *away* from the destruction, the chaos, the terror. But there was no escaping it. It was all around us, too close, too fast.

And then—*it stopped*.

The house was gone. The wreckage of it was all that was left. We stood there, breathing heavily, too terrified to speak. My legs were shaking, my chest was tight, and I couldn’t even—*couldn’t even think*—I just stared at the pile of rubble. The thing—*the creature*—was gone. But we weren’t safe. Not yet.

Timmy was beside us, so we grabbed him into our embrace, alive, but *changed*, somehow, like he’d seen something no child should ever see. Evelyn clung to me, and I to her, and we all stood there, frozed, holding each other as the dust settled, as the echoes of the nightmare slowly faded away.

But that silence—it was heavier than anything else. And the fear, it was still there. In the back of my mind, gnawing at the edges of my thoughts, I could feel it.

The nightmare wasn’t over. It couldn’t be.

...

Now, I’m sitting here, writing this in the big city. There’s noise here, all the time. Sirens, honking cars, the constant murmur of the crowd. But it doesn’t bother us anymore. The noise is normal. We’ve learned to drown it out, to let it become part of the rhythm of our life. It’s like we’ve lived here forever, and somehow… that night, that house—it already feels like a dream.

Timmy is different now. He’s *still* Timmy, but there’s something softer about him. Something older, too. The other day, he showed me a drawing he’d made—a picture of his mom and dad going to heaven. There were clouds, stars, and a golden light surrounding them. I don’t know how long he’s been thinking about them that way, but he told me they were happy now. He said they were watching over us. He said it with this quiet certainty, like it was the most natural thing in the world.

And for the first time in a long time, I think he might be right. I don’t know how or when it happened, but he’s starting to heal. The scars from that night are still there, buried somewhere deep, but Timmy’s imagination is still alive, and it’s no longer a weapon. It’s his way of coming back to us, of understanding, of letting go.

It’s strange, though. Even now, I can’t help but remember the fear, the terror of what we had to do to protect him. The *Fulgence Illumum*, those damned artifacts—we took something from him that night. We didn’t just fight a creature. We fought against what makes him who he is. I can never forget the look on his face when he realized what had happened. But somehow, we’re all still here, still together, and in some ways, that’s all that matters.

We’re safe now. We’re *whole*. But I know that no matter how far we move from Obedient Grove, no matter how much the city’s noise drowns out everything else, I’ll never forget that silence—the quiet that swallowed us whole, that *thing* we fought, and the way our world shattered in an instant.

And I know, deep down, that we’ll never fully escape it. Not really. Not ever. But I’ll hold onto Timmy and Evelyn, and I’ll protect them for as long as I can. That’s all I can do. And maybe… just maybe… we’ll be alright.",25,0.96,1,dlschindler,2024-11-12 20:39:27,1gq2qzp,26,High
NoSleep,I Work at a Rescue Service as a Captain. My Last Bermuda Mission Was Beyond Impossible,"The sea had taken many things from me over the years—friends, crew, even pieces of myself—but it had never taken my sense of duty. A captain’s burden is the lives of others, and every decision weighs heavier when those lives hang by a thread. I’d made mistakes before, the kind that leave scars no storm can wash away, but I’d always sworn to put my crew and those in need above all else. That’s why I answered the distress call, even though it came from the Bermuda Triangle—a place where sailors vanish, and reason unravels. I didn’t trust the call, but I trusted my purpose: to bring people home, no matter the cost.

The distress signal came three days ago. A luxury liner, *Starfall Horizon*, stranded deep within the Bermuda Triangle, had stopped responding to all communication. The passengers were reportedly taken hostage by a group of pirates. Maritime law and duty made it my job to intervene, but this wasn’t my first brush with the strange and treacherous waters of the Triangle. I knew better than to trust a simple explanation in this cursed expanse.

The **Aegis**, my ship, was a sturdy rescue vessel, built for enduring rough seas and hostile situations. As we approached the coordinates, a strange silence blanketed the crew. The liner should have been visible long before we reached it, but the dense fog clinging to the horizon seemed determined to keep it hidden. Finally, as a dull glow crept across the sky, the **Starfall Horizon** emerged from the mist.

The ship was eerily still. No passengers waved for help, no signs of the chaos we had prepared for. Its massive hull leaned slightly to one side, and streaks of a dark, slimy residue trailed from its deck down to the waterline, giving the impression that the ship itself was bleeding.

Maclin, my first officer, leaned toward me as we stood on the bridge. His face was as tense as I’d ever seen it. “That doesn’t look like pirates.”

“No,” I agreed. “It doesn’t.”

We tethered the **Aegis** to the liner and prepared a boarding party. The rescue team armed themselves—protocol when dealing with potential hostiles—but I could sense their unease. This wasn’t a mission anyone wanted to be on, least of all me. Still, leaving those passengers to their fate wasn’t an option.

I led the team across the bridge connecting the two ships, the groan of metal beneath our boots unsettling in the stillness. The liner’s deck was slick with a pale slime that seemed to shimmer faintly under the weak light filtering through the mist. It clung to everything—the railings, the floor, even the air felt heavier, filled with the acrid, metallic tang of decay.

“Keep close,” I said to the team, motioning for them to move toward the bridge of the liner.

The ship’s bridge was empty. The controls were still active, though smeared with more of the strange slime. Static crackled from the communication systems, but no human voice emerged. I checked the logbooks, flipping through pages warped and sticking together, but the last entries offered nothing useful—just routine reports before everything stopped.

“Captain, over here!” one of the team called, his voice laced with urgency. He was near the entrance to the main stairwell. I joined him quickly and saw what had caught his attention.

The walls were streaked with pale, slimy tracks, running in uneven patterns as though something had been dragged—or had dragged itself—through the corridor. The substance pulsed faintly, almost imperceptibly, as though alive.

“What the hell is this?” the crewmember asked, stepping back from the trail.

I shook my head. “Something’s wrong here. This isn’t just a hijacking.”

Maclin joined us, his expression grim. “Where are the passengers? Even if the pirates ran, there should be bodies.”

“Or survivors,” I said. “Let’s check the lower decks.”

Descending into the ship’s depths, the air grew colder, and the strange, sour smell intensified. The tracks became more frequent, branching out in seemingly random directions. Some led into rooms, the doors of which were coated in slime and sealed shut. The crew exchanged nervous glances, but I pushed us forward. Whatever had happened here, I needed answers.

The source of the distress call turned out to be a makeshift barricade in the ship’s dining hall. Tables, chairs, and metal scrap had been piled high, blocking the entrance. On the other side, I could hear faint movements—rustling, scratching, and the occasional, quiet shuffle of feet.

“Break it down,” I ordered.

It took a few minutes, but we finally breached the barricade. Inside, we found a group of passengers—perhaps a dozen—huddled in the far corner. Their faces were gaunt, their eyes wide and sunken as though they hadn’t slept in days. Many were wrapped in blankets, their clothes stained with grime and slime. They didn’t look relieved to see us. They looked terrified.

“You’re safe now,” I began, stepping forward. “We’re here to help.”

A man at the front of the group, middle-aged with streaks of sweat matting his thinning hair, shook his head. “No one’s safe,” he said, his voice shaking. “Not from that thing.”

“What thing?” Maclin asked.

The man gestured toward the ceiling, where the slime seemed to thicken, branching out like veins. “It came from below. We thought it was the pirates at first, but they’re gone now. It’s… still here.”

The passengers shrank back at his words, their fear palpable.

“What is it?” I pressed. “What happened to the crew?”

Before he could answer, a sudden screech echoed through the hall. The sound was high-pitched and unnatural, reverberating through the ship like nails dragged across metal. The passengers whimpered, some covering their ears, others clutching each other tightly.

“Get back to the **Aegis**, now!” I barked to the team, gesturing for the passengers to follow.

As we ushered them toward the exit, the screech sounded again, this time closer. The corridor outside the dining hall seemed darker, the lights flickering and casting strange shapes across the walls. The slime on the floor had grown thicker, clinging to our boots and slowing our progress.

We hadn’t made it halfway back to the connecting bridge when the first sign of movement stopped us cold. A figure emerged from the shadows at the far end of the hallway. It was humanoid in shape but grotesquely distorted. Its pale, translucent skin revealed dark veins pulsing beneath the surface, giving it an almost unnatural glow. Its limbs were unnervingly thin and twisted, with claw-like fingers that seemed to twitch independently. It moved with an erratic, insect-like rhythm, its eyeless head tilting unnaturally toward us, as if perceiving the world through senses beyond our comprehension.

For a moment, we were frozen, unsure if what we were seeing was real. Then it let out a guttural clicking sound, followed by a burst of speed that defied logic. It charged toward us, its claws scraping the walls as it moved.

“Fire at it!” I shouted.

The crew opened fire, the deafening sound of gunfire filling the corridor. Bullets struck the creature, black ichor spraying from its wounds, but it barely slowed. One of the crewmembers panicked, turning to run, but the creature was on him in seconds, slamming him into the wall with enough force to dent the metal.

“Fall back!” I ordered, forcing myself to stay calm as we retreated toward the bridge. The passengers screamed as we passed, some refusing to move until Maclin physically dragged them forward.

As we reached the connecting bridge to the **Aegis**, I glanced back one last time. The creature stood at the far end of the corridor, its head tilted as if studying us. Slimy tracks glistened in its wake, and the faint glow beneath its skin pulsed faster, like a heartbeat. It didn’t pursue us, but somehow, that made it worse.

We sealed the door behind us and made it back to the **Aegis**. My crew scrambled to tend to the survivors, but I couldn’t shake the feeling we hadn’t escaped. The creature wasn’t just hunting us—it was spreading.

 Back on the **Aegis**, the tension was suffocating. The survivors were huddled in the mess hall, pale and silent as if speaking might summon the horrors they’d fled. My crew worked quickly, setting up quarantine protocols. The slime tracked from the liner was already being scrubbed from the deck and equipment, but I wasn’t sure it was enough.

Maclin stood beside me, his face grim. “We should cut them loose, Captain. Burn the *Starfall Horizon* and be done with it.”

I stared at him, my jaw tightening. “There are lives on the line.”

“And how many lives do we risk by bringing that thing with us?” He jabbed a finger toward the survivors. “You saw it. That wasn’t human.”

He wasn’t wrong, but I wasn’t ready to abandon the people we’d rescued—or the mystery of what had happened. Something had brought that creature aboard the liner, and I needed to know what it was before we left this cursed stretch of water.

“Seal the survivors in quarantine,” I said, my voice firm. “No one in or out until we know what we’re dealing with. And scrub every trace of that slime from the ship.”

Maclin looked like he wanted to argue, but he held his tongue. Instead, he gestured toward the corridor leading to the med bay. “Dr. Esteban’s looking at one of them now. You should see this.”

The med bay was eerily quiet when I entered. Dr. Esteban was hunched over his workbench, his gloved hands steady as he examined a sample of the pale slime under a microscope. A young man, one of the survivors, sat trembling on the examination table. His skin was clammy, and his breath came in uneven huffs.

“Doctor,” I said softly, stepping closer.

Esteban didn’t look up. “Captain, this substance… it’s alive.”

“What do you mean?”

He leaned back from the microscope, his expression grim. “The slime isn’t just residue. It’s teeming with microscopic organisms, almost parasitic in nature. They latch onto cells and begin… altering them.”

The survivor on the table groaned, clutching his stomach. Esteban turned toward him, his face lined with concern. “He was fine an hour ago, just shaken. Now his temperature is spiking, and his veins are discoloring.”

I stepped closer, my eyes narrowing. The man’s skin was taking on an unnatural pallor, almost translucent. Dark veins spiderwebbed across his arms, and as he moved, I noticed a faint shimmer beneath his skin—like something was shifting beneath the surface.

“Restrain him,” Esteban said sharply. “Quickly.”

Before I could react, the man let out a guttural screech, his back arching violently. His eyes rolled back, and his limbs spasmed as black ichor began oozing from his pores. The air filled with the sour, metallic stench I’d smelled on the liner.

“What’s happening to him?” I demanded, grabbing restraints from the nearby tray.

“He’s transforming,” Esteban said, his voice tight. “Whatever’s in that slime, it’s taken hold of him.”

We managed to strap him to the table, but the man thrashed with unnatural strength, the metal groaning under the strain. His jaw stretched wide, his teeth sharpening into jagged points. His hands curled into claws, and his skin began to split, revealing patches of the same pale, resin-like substance we’d seen on the creature aboard the *Starfall Horizon*.

“Get back!” Esteban shouted.

The man tore free of the restraints with a horrifying roar, his body snapping upright. He lunged toward us, but I grabbed a scalpel from the tray and slashed at his arm. Black ichor sprayed across the floor, but he barely reacted, his glowing veins pulsing faster.

I drew my sidearm and fired. The gunshot echoed through the room, and the creature collapsed, black resin pooling beneath it. For a moment, I thought it was over. But then its body began to twitch, the resin hardening around it like a shell.

“We need to burn it,” Esteban said urgently, his voice shaking. “Now.”

We incinerated the body. The smell of burning resin and flesh lingered in the air long after the flames had died down. I turned to Esteban, my stomach churning. “How long before the others start showing symptoms?”

He hesitated. “I don’t know. But if even one of them is infected, this entire ship is at risk.”

I returned to the quarantine area, where Maclin was overseeing the survivors. The passengers were seated on the floor, their expressions vacant. One woman rocked back and forth, muttering under her breath. Another man stared at the wall, his fingers twitching.

“They don’t look good,” Maclin said quietly. “A few are showing fever symptoms. You need to make a call, Captain.”

I looked through the reinforced glass at the survivors, my mind racing. These people were terrified, broken. But how many of them were already compromised? How many were carriers for whatever horror had taken hold of the ship?

I turned to Maclin. “Seal the quarantine zone tighter. No one gets in or out without my authorization.”

“And then what?” he asked. “Wait for them to turn into monsters?”

“We’ll isolate the infected,” I said, though the words felt hollow. “Esteban’s working on it.”

Maclin didn’t argue, but the doubt in his eyes was clear.

As night fell, the **Aegis** seemed to grow quieter, though it wasn’t the calm of safety. The silence was heavy with tension, broken only by the faint creak of the ship and the low hum of the engines. I sat in the dim light of my cabin, staring at the ship’s logs, but my mind kept drifting back to the creature I’d seen. Its translucent skin, the shimmer beneath it, the slimy tracks it left behind—it wasn’t just a predator. It was an infection, a contagion with intent.

A sudden knock at the door jolted me. Maclin entered, his face pale. “We’ve got movement near the quarantine zone.”

I followed him to the security station, where the surveillance monitors displayed the corridor outside the sealed room. The slimy tracks we’d seen aboard the liner were spreading, snaking along the walls and floor. The survivors inside moved restlessly, their bodies twitching as though in response to something we couldn’t see.

And then, on one of the monitors, I saw it.

A pale figure, about the size of a human, creeping along the ceiling. Its spindly limbs moved with insect-like precision, its eyeless head tilting toward the camera. A faint shimmer rippled beneath its translucent skin, and as it turned, I saw the glow of its veins pulsing steadily.

“Is that… the same one?” Maclin whispered.

“No,” I said. “It’s another.”

The realization hit me like a wave. The creature wasn’t just hunting us. It was breeding.

The discovery that there was more than one of those creatures sent a ripple of dread through the crew. The ship seemed to shrink around us, its narrow corridors and confined spaces pressing in like a trap. The thought of those translucent monstrosities prowling unseen, leaving their slimy trails as they hunted, unnerved even the most battle-hardened among us.

Maclin and I stood in the security room, watching the grainy footage of the new creature creeping along the ceiling near the quarantine zone. Its movements were eerily precise, its limbs clicking faintly as it navigated the resin-slicked walls.

“We need to kill it before it gets to the survivors,” Maclin said, gripping the edge of the console so tightly his knuckles turned white.

“And if it already has?” I countered, my gaze fixed on the screen. Inside the quarantine room, the survivors moved restlessly, their skin pale and glistening. One woman was hunched over in the corner, her body shaking violently. The others gave her a wide berth, their fear palpable even through the monitor.

Maclin frowned. “We can’t let it spread.”

I nodded. “Arm a team. I’ll go with you.”

We approached the quarantine zone cautiously, our boots sticking to the resin-coated floor. The stench of decay hung heavy in the air, mingling with the acrid tang of burnt metal from the earlier firefight. Slime trails crisscrossed the corridors, faintly pulsing in the dim light.

“Eyes up,” I whispered. “It could be anywhere.”

The creature struck before I finished speaking.

It lunged from the shadows, its eyeless head snapping toward us with unnerving precision. One of its spindly arms struck the nearest crewmember, sending him crashing into the wall. The creature hissed, its translucent skin shimmering as its glowing veins pulsed faster.

“Open fire!” I shouted, raising my weapon.

The corridor erupted in gunfire. Bullets tore into the creature, black ichor spraying as it screeched and writhed. It moved with inhuman speed, climbing the walls and darting between us with terrifying agility. Maclin took aim and fired a clean shot through its torso, and the creature collapsed with a sickening wet thud. Its body twitched, the resin around it hardening into a shell as the glow beneath its skin dimmed.

“Is it… dead?” one of the crew asked, his voice trembling.

“Not for long,” I said. “Burn it.”

We doused the creature in accelerant and set it alight. Flames roared to life, consuming its body and filling the corridor with thick, acrid smoke. As the resin melted away, the slime coating the walls seemed to recoil, its faint pulse fading.

“Good work,” I said, though my relief was short-lived. “Let’s check the survivors.”

Inside the quarantine room, the situation was worse than I’d feared. The woman who had been shaking in the corner was now on the floor, her body convulsing violently. Black ichor oozed from her mouth and eyes, spreading across the floor around her. The other survivors backed away as far as they could, their faces twisted in a mix of horror and revulsion.

“We can’t help her,” Esteban said quietly, standing near the door. “She’s too far gone.”

I crouched beside her, watching as her veins darkened and her skin began to stretch unnaturally. The faint shimmer beneath her flesh had grown stronger, the glow pulsing in sync with the slime spreading across the room. She wasn’t just infected—she was transforming.

“Get the others out of here,” I said, standing quickly. “Now.”

Maclin moved to guide the survivors out, but as the door opened, the woman let out a guttural screech. Her body arched, her limbs twisting as claws tore through the ends of her fingers. She lunged toward us, moving with a speed that belied her deteriorating form.

I raised my weapon and fired on instinct, the shot striking her squarely in the chest. She crumpled to the ground, dark ichor spilling out and spreading across the floor in thick, glistening pools. Even then, she didn’t stop moving; her body convulsed violently, and the resin began to seep outward, encasing her in a cocoon-like shell that seemed to grow with a life of its own.

“Seal this room,” I ordered. “No one goes inside.”

Back on the bridge, Esteban delivered the grim news. “This isn’t just an infection. It’s a life cycle. The parasites start small, microscopic, but they use the host to grow and mature. Once the transformation is complete, they emerge as those creatures we’ve been fighting.”

“And the slime?” I asked.

“It’s part of the process,” he explained. “It… it’s alive, spreading spores and preparing the environment for the parasites to thrive. If we don’t stop it, the entire ship will become a breeding ground.”

I glanced at the monitors, where the slime continued to spread across the ship. It was no longer just a nuisance—it was taking over. “What happens if one of those cocoons finishes forming?”

Esteban hesitated, then said, “It will hatch. And the creature inside will be stronger than the ones we’ve faced.”

The alarms blared as we prepared for the next stage of the fight. The crew armed themselves, flamethrowers and accelerants replacing their standard weapons. The quarantine zone was sealed off, but the slime had already begun spreading through the ventilation system, and faint, clicking sounds echoed from the lower decks.

“They’re multiplying,” Maclin said grimly. “We need to get to the source.”

He was right. The slime was emanating from the cargo hold, where the luggage and other supplies from the *Starfall Horizon* had been stored. It was the perfect breeding ground—dark, damp, and untouched since the transfer. If we didn’t stop it there, we wouldn’t have a ship left to save.

We descended into the cargo hold, the air growing colder and heavier with each step. The resin coated the walls and floor, forming grotesque patterns that seemed almost deliberate. Cocoon-like structures hung from the ceiling, their surfaces pulsing faintly. The sound of dripping slime echoed through the cavernous space.

At the center of the hold, we saw it.

The largest cocoon yet, nearly the size of a small car, pulsated with a sickly light. Slimy tracks led to and from it, and the air around it seemed to hum with energy. The resin here was thicker, harder, as though protecting the structure within.

“That’s it,” Maclin said, his voice low. “That’s the source.”

“Set the charges,” I ordered, keeping my weapon trained on the cocoon. “We end this now.”

As the team moved to place explosives around the hold, the cocoon began to split. The pulsing light intensified, and a low, guttural sound emanated from within. I raised my weapon, my heart pounding as the first spindly limb emerged from the crack.

The Parasite King had arrived.

The cocoon cracked open with a sickening sound, the hardened resin splitting to reveal the creature within. The **Parasite King** emerged slowly, almost deliberately, as if savoring the moment of its arrival. It was smaller than I’d expected, about the size of a human, but there was nothing remotely human about it.

Its pale, translucent skin shimmered faintly, the glow of its veins pulsating in rhythmic waves that seemed to draw the light from the cargo hold. Its limbs were unnaturally long and spindly, ending in sharp, clawed fingers that twitched with unsettling precision. Its eyeless head turned toward us, tilting as if listening. Beneath its stretched skin, something shifted—a ripple of movement that made my stomach churn.

“Stand back!” I shouted, my voice echoing through the hold.

The creature stepped forward, its clawed feet making faint clicking sounds against the resin-coated floor. Slime oozed from its body as it moved, leaving a trail that pulsed faintly, as though alive. It opened its mouth, revealing rows of needle-like teeth glistening with black ichor. A low, guttural sound emanated from its throat, resonating through the air like a living vibration.

“Charges are set, Captain,” Maclin called, his voice tight with urgency. “We need to move!”

The creature let out a shriek, a sound so piercing it felt like it was clawing at the inside of my skull. It lunged with terrifying speed, its limbs snapping toward us like the legs of a spider. I fired instinctively, the bullets striking its translucent flesh and sending sprays of black ichor across the resin-covered floor. But the creature barely faltered. It moved with an insect-like rhythm, jerking and twisting to avoid the worst of the fire.

“Focus your shots on its core!” I shouted, aiming for the faintly glowing veins beneath its skin.

The crew opened fire, their weapons roaring in the confined space. The Parasite King screeched again, its movements becoming more erratic as it dodged and lunged. It grabbed one of the crewmembers, its claws sinking into his torso, and hurled him across the hold. He hit the wall with a sickening crunch, his body crumpling to the floor.

Maclin stepped forward with one of the makeshift incendiary devices, activating it with practiced precision. A torrent of fire roared to life, engulfing the creature and illuminating the resin-coated walls in a fiery glow. The Parasite King recoiled, its translucent skin bubbling and splitting under the intense heat. Yet it refused to back down. Instead, it emitted another ear-splitting scream and lunged, its claws cutting through the air with deadly intent.

I tackled Maclin out of the way just as the creature struck, its claws carving deep gouges into the resin-coated floor where we’d been standing. “Get up!” I barked, pulling him to his feet.

The creature turned toward us, its eyeless head tilting again. The pulsing light beneath its skin grew brighter, faster, as though it was feeding off the energy of the room. The slime coating the walls began to ripple, spreading outward in a wave that made the entire hold feel alive.

“We need to blow it now!” I shouted. “Set it off!”

Maclin hesitated, his gaze darting to the rest of the crew still scattered around the hold.

“There’s no time!” I yelled, grabbing the detonator from his belt.

The Parasite King lunged again, its movements impossibly fast. I rolled to the side, the detonator clutched tightly in my hand. My breath came in ragged bursts as I struggled to find an opening. The creature loomed above me, its claws raised for a killing strike, when a blast of fire caught it in the side. One of the crewmembers, bloodied but alive, had picked up a flamethrower and was pouring flames into the creature’s exposed core.

“Do it, Captain!” Maclin screamed.

I pressed the detonator.

The explosion was deafening, a thunderous roar that shook the entire ship. The cargo hold erupted in fire and smoke, the force of the blast hurling me backward. I hit the ground hard, the air driven from my lungs as heat and light engulfed the room. The Parasite King let out one final, ear-piercing shriek before its body was consumed by the flames. The resin-coated walls cracked and crumbled, the slime boiling away as the fire spread.

When the smoke began to clear, I forced myself to my feet. The hold was unrecognizable—a charred, smoldering ruin. The cocoons hanging from the ceiling had been incinerated, their contents reduced to ash. The slime was gone, leaving behind only scorched metal and the faint smell of burning resin.

The Parasite King was dead.

Back on the bridge, the surviving crew gathered in silence. Maclin leaned heavily against the console, his face pale but determined. “The readings are clear,” he said, his voice hoarse. “No more movement. It’s over.”

I nodded, though the weight in my chest didn’t lift. We had survived, but at what cost? Three crewmembers were dead, and the survivors from the *Starfall Horizon* were quarantined indefinitely. Dr. Esteban confirmed that the infection had been eradicated, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that we’d only scratched the surface of whatever nightmare had taken hold of the Bermuda Triangle.

“We’re leaving,” I said finally. “Set a course for open waters. And log this in the black box. If anyone ever finds this ship… they need to know.”

Maclin nodded, but neither of us spoke as the **Aegis** moved away from the wreckage. The sea swallowed the debris behind us, the mist rolling in to obscure our path. I stared out at the water, my thoughts weighed down by the lingering sense of what we had left behind.

The Parasite King was dead, but the slime, the infection, the creatures—they weren’t just random horrors. They were part of something larger, something far older and more terrifying than I could imagine. And as much as I wanted to believe we’d left it behind, a part of me knew the Triangle wasn’t done with us yet.

But that was a worry for another day.

For now, we were alive.

And for a captain, that was enough.",18,0.83,0,myrasam79,2024-11-12 18:44:28,1gq0f3d,18,High
NoSleep,God Healed an Amputee,"Alondra was a faith healer, and like every single one of her kind, she was a complete and total fraud. She came from a long line of faith healers, those who would go town to town, set up a revival tent, preach a sermon, and then heal those who came forth, all in the name of God and money.

I worked for Alondra as part of her travelling revival show. My job was to vet audience members before the show began, helping decide which of them would be invited on stage to have hands laid upon them and supposedly be healed. I’d start my day in the parking lot, which was often just a field on the outskirts of whatever town we were visiting. I’d watch intently as people got out of their cars and headed toward the revival tent.

Typically, I’d keep an eye out for people who used a wheelchair to get around, but still had the ability to walk short distances. I’d spot them right away – the passenger door of their car would pop open, they’d slowly get out, and then shuffle over to the trunk of the car, where their companion would pull out their wheelchair and guide them into a seated position. These were the people who’d get invited onstage to be healed. I’d follow behind them and covertly listen in to their conversations so that I could pick up some useful tidbits of information, like their names. I’d take note of where they sat, and then pass all that information on to our production crew.

Sometimes I’d see people in wheelchairs who couldn’t walk even a little bit. There was no chance in hell they’d be invited up to the stage – after all, God will only heal those who can meet him halfway.

Now, just so you have an understanding of how everything worked, let me run you through a typical revival. Start by imagining this:

*It’s revival day, and the show is beginning. Alondra starts her sermon by spouting off whatever Biblical nonsense she’s decided to talk about that day. It usually centers around Jesus healing the faithful, but sometimes it’s completely random, just Bible quotes that Alondra selected from some deep recess of her memory.*

*While she’s busy telling lies to the believers, the crew coordinates which audience members are going to be invited onstage. I key my radio and speak to Kyle, our production supervisor. “The guy in the left section wearing a blue shirt and red Angels ballcap,” I say. “He’s in a wheelchair, but I saw him take some steps. He should go first. His name’s Lawrence. The wife is Shelly.” Kyle listens intently as I tell him about Lawrence and the others I vetted.*

*Alondra then brings the sermon back into focus by telling the crowd that she herself has been selected by Jesus Christ to carry out his work in the heartland of America. She takes a big dramatic pause and looks out to the expectant crowd, some of whom want to be healed, and some who just want to see God’s hand in action. She clears her throat and points her hands at the audience. “God is speaking to me right now,” she says. “He’s telling me there’s someone here who’s been in a lot of pain lately, someone who prays every day that he’ll be able to get up out of his wheelchair and dance with his wife once again.” She turns and looks directly at our mark. “Lawrence. Yes, you in the blue shirt. Christ is calling you. Come on up here with your beautiful wife Shelly.”*

*Lawrence and Shelly, faces full of happy tears, make their way to the front. Alondra tells them how special they are, how she knows that Lawrence has been dreaming about the day when he can stand and hold his wife close once again.*

*She lays a hand on Lawrence’s forehead and commands him to be healed. Immediately two of our stagehands run forward and lift him from his chair. Lawrence, adrenalin pulsing through his veins, puts his legs down and stands up. Whatever pain he may be feeling in his legs is eclipsed by the applause from the crowd, and a desire to not piss off Jesus. He takes a step. Then another. His wife reaches into her purse and puts all her money in a nearby donation bin. Others in the crowd do the same as Lawrence spins in a circle and smiles. The next person is called to the stage and the healing continues.*

And that’s how it went. Town to town, dollar to dollar. We mostly “healed” people in wheelchairs, but we would also “heal” those who suffered from any sort of chronic pain, and even cancer patients. It was by far the best paying job I ever had, and I grew close to everyone in the crew. We were a den of thieves and liars, but we were honest and noble amongst each other.

Alondra was middle-aged and very charismatic, both onstage and off. She could preach a sermon about watching paint dry, and it would somehow still be the best sermon you ever heard. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had all been faith healers. It was how she was raised, and she intrinsically knew what everyone around her needed to hear. She dominated any conversation she was part of, but she was always so interesting that nobody minded. When she wasn’t preaching, she spoke about hockey, purses, horses, TV shows, and pretty much anything except God and Jesus.

Kyle, our production supervisor, had once been a firm believer in Christ. Initially he’d joined up with Alondra under the belief that her powers were truly God-given, and not the result of trickery and deception. He was quickly disappointed, but soon found solace within the fat wads of cash he was making. During his first few years, he rationalized his actions by claiming that he’d donate his money to charity, but after a while he stopped saying that. There were ten of us in total who ran the show. I joined the crew knowing from the beginning that it was all a scam, but separating the foolish from their money didn’t bother me one bit.

The beginning of the end came one morning when Alondra walked out of her trailer and addressed the rest of us. “I’m going to heal an amputee,” she said matter-of-factly. We laughed. “No. I’m serious,” she said. “Jesus came to me in a dream last night. He told me how to do it.”

The rest of that day, all she could talk about was how Jesus had spoken to her, and that she’d never experienced anything like it before. “He glowed,” she recalled. “I’ve never felt so at peace than when he was with me. I was sitting at a large table with him. And then, suddenly, there were eight of him, and they all spoke in unison, telling me exactly what I need to know.”

It was weird. I mean, here was a woman who never discussed God or Jesus unless she was trying to con people out of their money, and all the sudden, in the most earnest way, she was telling us how great Jesus was, and that she had dreamed about EIGHT copies of him. We kept trying to laugh it off, but that only made her more insistent that she had a newly divine purpose.

At that point, we had a couple more days before our next revival. We were camped outside some Podunk town, still setting up our tent and equipment. Alondra pulled me aside and spoke to me. “I need you to go to the ocean and get some seaweed. Burn it on the sand and then bring the ash back to me.”

“What?!” I said.

“I need ash from seaweed.  The seaweed needs to be burned on the sand. It can’t be done any place else, and it must be done today. That’s what Jesus told me.”

I protested. “Are you insane? Even if I wanted to, we’re two-hundred miles from the ocean!”

“We have time,” she said, holding out the key to her Mercedes. “Take my car.”

“Can’t you go?” I asked.

She shook her head. “No. I have to stay here and meditate.”

“Since when do you meditate?” I asked.

She ignored my question and forced the car key into my hand and smiled. “Make sure you do it right. If you don’t follow the directions exactly, I’ll know.” She turned around and walked back to her trailer.

I quickly found Kyle, who was helping set up the tent. “Alondra is acting really weird,” I said.

“Gee, ya think?” Kyle replied.

“She’s making me drive to the ocean and bring back some seaweed.”

“What?” Kyle said as he took off his hat and scratched his head in confusion, “There’s too much work here!”

“Why don’t you go speak to her?” I asked. “Maybe you can talk some sense into her.”

“I’ll be right back.” Kyle stormed off to her trailer, but not more than five minutes later, he returned. He was clearly distressed. “Maybe you should just go do it,” he said with shaky hands. “I don’t think I can reason with her right now.”

I looked down at the car key in my hand. “Really?”

“Think of it as a day at the beach. At least it gets you out of helping with the set up,” he said.

I clamped my hand around the key while pondering my options. “There’s no way I’m going to drive two-hundred miles to the ocean! Maybe I’ll just go into town and catch a couple of movies. Alondra won’t know the difference, and I’ll just pick up some ashes from that campsite over the hill.”

Kyle glanced over at Alondra’s trailer and shook his head, almost like he was in fear of her. “No, she’ll know if you don’t do it right.”

“Man, what did she say to you?” I asked.

“It’s not really what she said, it’s how she said it,” he replied. “She told me to tell you to do as she asked. But the way she spoke her words…” he trailed off for a moment. “It just made me scared. I can’t really explain it.”

I rolled my eyes, but I knew there was no more discussion to be had. Anyway, Alondra had always paid me well and treated me like family. I supposed it wouldn’t kill me to do what she asked. I got into her car and drove off, giving Kyle a wave of my hand as I passed him.

Once I hit the open highway, I floored the gas pedal and watched the scenery zip by. It took me less than three hours to get to the coast. As I passed through a small beach town, I spotted a touristy general store. I knew that if I was going to burn seaweed on the beach, I’d need a few supplies. I pulled in and bought a lighter, a flat metal pan to collect the ash, and a plastic container to hold the ash for the drive home. By that point I was already within walking distance of the coast, so I darted across the coastal highway and made my way to the sand. It was an overcast, off-season day, so I had the beach pretty much to myself.

After a few minutes of walking along the coastline, I saw a floating patch of seaweed, not too far from the shore. I removed my shoes and socks and waded into the ocean. When I got to the patch, I saw little sea critters, who’d been using the patch as a hideaway, flitter off into the green-hued water. I grabbed a mass of seaweed and tried to tear off a chunk. When that proved difficult, I got out my pocketknife and cut off a large piece, and then returned to the sand.

Like any regular, sane person, I’d never tried to burn seaweed before, so I wasn’t exactly sure how it should be done. After trying a few different things, what I found worked best was simply holding the seaweed in one hand, and the flaming lighter in the other, and then putting the two together to let the seaweed cook. The seaweed was wet, obviously, so it took a while for all the water to boil off.

As the seaweed began to darken and bubble, the most ungodly smell hit me. Now, I wasn’t expecting it to smell good – seaweed never does, but I guess I was at least expecting it to smell like the ocean. Instead, the odor could only be described as a combination of dog crap and burning plastic. It was so awful that after a while, it caused a sense of dread to form in the pit of my stomach, as if I was doing something so unnatural that the Earth itself was telling me to stop. Nonetheless, I pressed on, mostly because I’d already gone so far that I was determined to see it through. A massive headache spread from my left temple to my right temple, which I tried my best to ignore. When the seaweed finally started to turn to ash, which took a long time, by the way, I let it fall into my pan, and then used my pocketknife to scrape it into the plastic container. I discarded the pan and lighter on the sand, and after a moment of thought, I discarded my pocketknife too. It was a contaminated item, and I didn’t want it any longer.

I rinsed my hands off in the ocean for a good long minute, and then walked back to Alondra’s Mercedes. I tossed the container of ash in the trunk and headed back, fighting off the throbbing headache and trying to focus on my long drive. I drove much slower than before, and I returned well after dark, when everyone else was asleep. I stumbled into my trailer, trying hard not to wake my roomies, and collapsed onto my bed.

I awoke the next morning feeling much better. I retrieved the container of ash and gave it to Alondra, who looked exceedingly pleased. She opened the container and rubbed the tip of her finger in the ash. “Thank you, bringer of ash,” she said as she grazed her ashy finger against my forehead, leaving a small mark in its wake. “You will be rewarded.”

She acted as if there was no foul smell at all as she put the cap back on the container, but I almost vomited. Once she was out of sight, I ran to look for some water to rinse the ash from my forehead. Not only did it stink, but it also caused a burning sensation. I found a ten-gallon water cooler and pretty much used all of it to wash my head. There was still a red mark where the ash had been, but otherwise I seemed okay. Alondra kept to herself the rest of that day, while I focused on my work, doing my best to avoid thinking about the task I’d performed. When I ran into Kyle, it seemed that he was in a better mood, after having been spooked by Alondra the day before.

Our revival was scheduled for a day later, and while Kyle truthfully assured Alondra that he’d found an amputee for her to heal, he separately told all of us to play it like any regular revival. “We’ll do the wheelchair people first, and maybe a couple of cancer patients,” he told us. “I’ve arranged for an amputee to be in the audience, so once the money is collected, he can go up there and Alondra can do whatever it is she thinks she’s going to do.” He glanced over his shoulder to make sure Alondra wasn’t looking. “I swear, if she wasn’t the boss…” he trailed off before telling us to get to work.

The next day, as the fools from the town began to show up, we assumed our roles. I blended into the crowd and spied on those who were arriving, selecting targets and gathering information. Everything went as expected, right up until the point that the show began. Alondra’s sermon was different this time. Instead of talking about Jesus healing lepers, or sick servants, or friend’s mothers, she seemed indignant, maybe even furious. She stayed laser-focused, talking angrily about the wages of sin, and other bullcrap like that.

As she ended her sermon, and the show began to segue over to the healing, Kyle came over the radio to give Alondra her first patient. “Fat man with the blue shirt and long mustache. Second row. Name’s Joe.”

Alondra nonchalantly reached up and removed her tiny earpiece, letting it fall to the stage floor. She’d just disconnected herself from the rest of us. I could hear Kyle react. “Alondra! Alondra what are you doing?” But of course, she could no longer hear him.

Alondra looked out to the audience and then pointed directly to Kyle’s planted amputee. “You! The lord is calling you up here!” Our lighting tech quickly adjusted to the unexpected change in the show and re-aimed the spotlight at the man with only one arm.

I heard Kyle’s voice coming through the radio again. “Oh crap!”

We all looked at each other uneasily as the man rose from his chair and approached Alondra. I’m not sure where Kyle found this guy, but it soon became apparent that he hadn’t done a very good job vetting him. The guy was gruff looking dude.

Alondra greeted him with the biggest smile I’d ever seen. “Please, tell us your name.”

“Henry Woodruff,” the man said curtly.

“And what brings you to seek out the Lord today?”

Apparently, nobody’d mentioned to Henry that he was supposed to be playing the role of a downtrodden, yet hopeful and god-fearing man who only wanted to be healed. “I was paid a hundred bucks to show up here.”

Alondra wasn’t bothered by the man’s tone at all. “And please tell us what led to your tragic situation.”

Henry looked down at the shoulder that had once held his arm. “Oh, you mean this unfortunate bit of business right here? Car accident. Drunk driver.”

“And have you found it in your heart to forgive this drunk driver?” Alondra asked.

Henry chuckled. “Yeah I forgive him every time I see him in the mirror.”

Alondra didn’t miss a beat. “Oh, so you were the drunk driver?”

Henry shrugged his shoulders. “It happens, ya know.”

“Well Henry, the lord forgives and heals all those who seek it, and the Lord will heal you here today.”

“Hey, me and the lord will be square as long as I get my hundred bucks,” he replied. The crowd was becoming noticeably uneasy as they shifted in their seats and muttered to themselves about the uncomfortable interaction happening on the stage. I took my earpiece out just so I didn’t have to listen to all the cuss words Kyle was spitting out.

Alondra reached for the container of ash that I’d provided her. The ushers, who normally helped to lift the healed from their wheelchairs, glanced at one another from the sidelines, not knowing exactly what their role was going to be in this healing. “Henry,” Alondra said as she reached for his sleeve, “may I see the spot where your arm was?”

Henry grunted his permission as Alondra pushed up the loose sleeve. She looked out to the audience. “Through the power of belief and prayer this man will grow a new arm!”

The audience gasped and leaned forward in their seats. Alondra opened the container, dipped two fingers in the ash, and the smeared it all over Henry’s stub. Henry wrinkled his nose as the smell hit him, and seconds later, the crowd began muttering their disdain over the smell too. I could tell from the look on Henry’s face that he couldn’t wait to collect his hundred dollars and then get the heck out of there. Alondra addressed one of the ushers. “Could you please hand me that prayer cloth over there?” The usher looked around and saw the cloth Alondra was referring to. He quickly retrieved it and brought it to her. She wrapped the cloth around the ash and held it in place. “Henry, do you feel the power of the lord coursing through you?”

Henry’s face turned pale. “It burns!” he shouted as he reflexively pulled away from her.

Again, not missing a beat, Alondra removed the cloth from the retreating Henry and looked to the crowd. “Now witness the POWER OF THE LORD!”

All of the sudden, Henry gave an excited yelp. “What the Hell?” he said as he glanced down at his shoulder. I didn’t have a good vantage point, but from what I could tell, there seemed to be something erupting from Henry’s stump. It was small at first, maybe the size of a finger, but quickly, and miraculously, it grew in length and thickness. It was a green wiggling appendage that made me feel nauseous just looking at it. After half a minute it must’ve been the size of an elephant’s trunk, but even then, its growth showed no signs of slowing.

Henry, who’d to that point had been shocked into silence while his new arm grew, let out the most awful scream I’d ever heard. The appendage began flailing around wildly, and by the wild expression on Henry’s face, it was obvious he had no control over its movements.

Upon hearing the scream, Alondra seemed to snap out of whatever holy fugue she’d been stuck in. For just a moment she had a wide-eyed expression on her face before she began to back away. The appendage, which by then was about ten feet long, could only be described as something that looked like a tentacle from of massive octopus. At first, it flailed around randomly along the stage, its movements like an out-of-control firehose fishtailing wildly on the floor. But suddenly, the movements of the tentacle seemed to become purposeful as it reached its full size. As Alondra continued to back away, the tentacle reached out and swept her feet from under her, causing her to land on her back. At that point Kyle came running onto the stage, reaching out to Alondra to try and help her up. The tentacle shot out and wrapped itself around his neck before he could even get to her, making several loops and then squeezing tight. His face instantly turned purple as he gasped for breath and clawed helplessly at the tentacle, trying to free himself.  

Henry looked to be in a panic, still having no control over what was happening with his newly sprouted appendage. He reached across his chest with his other arm and began striking at it in a vain attempt to wrest some sort of control over what was happening to his body, but his efforts were useless.

Alondra finally found enough wherewithal to right herself. Her legs wobbled as she stood up and tried to move away. The tentacle gave one last jerk around Kyle’s neck – even from my distant vantage point I could hear his neck snap. The tentacle tossed his rag-doll body toward the fleeing crowd, where it crashed into some empty folding chairs that had held spectators only moments before. The tentacle whipped across the stage and managed to grab onto Alondra, right before she almost managed to get away. It wrapped itself around her waist and lifted her up.

Amidst the screaming and panic of the audience, I locked eyes with Alondra as she was held high up in the air – she knew she was moments from death. Now, one thing you need to know about Alondra is that despite her deceitful professional life, to me she was like a big-sister, den-mother, and good friend, all rolled into one. She’d taken me in and gave me purpose when nobody else had. At that point I did what was perhaps the first selfless act in my life – I ran toward the stage to try and help her. 

I couldn’t get there fast enough though. The tentacle slammed Alondra to the floor, face first. It raised her up again as I ran on stage and jumped onto the thrashing tentacle, trying to use my weight to halt its movements, or at least slow them down. A stream of blood was gushing from Alondra’s nose, and most of her front teeth had been knocked out. I had a hard time holding onto the slick tentacle, and ended up slipping off and tumbling to the stage floor. The tentacle slammed Alondra to the ground a second time, even harder than the first. Then, it raised her up one last time, as if it was displaying its trophy to the world. Alondra’s final punishment came as the tentacle smashed her into the floor with so much force that the entire stage nearly collapsed from the impact.

It released her limp body and turned toward me. I’d already righted myself and had nearly moved out of its reach when I felt it wrap around my ankle. Its grasp felt like a vise clamping around my joint, and I could feel my bones crack under the stress.

The only thing that saved me is that Barry, one of our production assistants, came running in with an axe and began hacking at the tentacle. He landed one good blow, cutting deep into the appendage, but he didn’t get a chance to land a second one, as the tentacle released its grip from my ankle and reached out toward him. I took the opportunity to start crawling off the stage, but from the corner of my eye I saw that, rather than toy with Barry, the tentacle wasted no time and impaled him right through his abdomen, exiting out his backside. Barry had a look of surprise on his face as he dropped the axe to the floor. I kept crawling and managed to get myself off the stage.     

From what I could see of the audience, most of them had managed to flee, but at least two men had drawn guns and began firing once they had clear shots.

Bang – The first shot hit Henry right in the kneecap, causing him to crumple to the floor. This seemed to have no effect on the tentacle, and it continued to wave Barry’s impaled body around like it was a victory flag.

Bang Bang – the next two shots hit the tentacle directly, causing it to pull out of Barry, who fell lifelessly to the floor.

Bang – The fourth bullet sailed wide and struck another one of our production assistants who was behind the stage. He fell down face first.

Bang – The fifth shot hit Henry right in the middle of his forehead, blasting out through the back of his skull and carrying some brain matter along with it. Henry slumped over but couldn’t fall completely to the ground with the tentacle acting like a kickstand that kept him propped up. The tentacle continued to flop around like a fish pulled from a pond.

Another person, I don’t even know who, ran up to the stage, grabbed the loose axe, and began hacking away at the tentacle, managing to sever it from Henry’s body after many blows. Even then, it continued to twitch defiantly for another ten minutes.

Everything was a bloody mess. Barry, Alondra, Kyle and Henry were not only dead, but also barely recognizable as human. Our other production assistant, the one who’d been shot, was also dead.

Our audience went screaming to their homes, while at the same time, the police, fire department, and even state and federal agencies were summoned. But what sense could they make of the scene of carnage in front of them?

In the end, the official government report, and the mainstream news media, called it a mass shooting, even though only two people were killed by bullets. The report made no mention of the two-hundred eyewitness testimonies that said an octopus tentacle had grown from Henry’s stump, only that a tentacle had been found at the scene, and that it must’ve been used in some sort of previously undocumented pseudo-Christian ritual. One of the popular tabloid newspapers of the time, which had a reputation for distasteful gossip and sensational headlines, ran a fairly accurate article about the incident. But aside from that, everything seemed to get swept under the rug. Keep in mind this was many years ago, before everyone carried a smart phone in their pocket, so there was never any video footage of the incident.

I often think back to that day and try to figure out exactly what happened. The only conclusion I can come to is that, if you piss off God long enough, he responds. I don’t understand the meaning of Alondra’s dream, or why it flipped her so hard. I will say that I’ve become a better person. There’s a scar on my forehead where Alondra wiped the ash. For years after the incident, whenever I thought about engaging in some sort of unethical behavior, the scar would start to tingle, and I’d think better of it. Today, I work an honest job, and I’m teaching my children the value of honest work as well. However, I can’t go so far as to say that I’ve become religious, because no God that would kill my friends so mercilessly deserves my adulation. I understand some of you may feel otherwise – that maybe they deserved their fates – but your opinions are of no concern to me. Perhaps I just need more time.

I never paid too much attention to the sermons that Alondra delivered. They were, after all, lies spewed out of the mouth of a master liar. Nonetheless, some of the verses stuck in my mind, and while I know many people find comfort in the Bible, one of the verses she used to preach will always leave me feeling a little uneasy:

*Friends, do not avenge yourselves; instead, leave room for His wrath. For it is written: Vengeance belongs to Me; I will repay, says the Lord.* \- Romans 12:19

The skeptical have asked of faith healers, many times, “Why won’t God heal an amputee?”

To that, I say, “God did.”",92,0.95,3,Thomas-O,2024-11-12 08:12:39,1gplm3u,95,High
NoSleep,I Was A Park Ranger Looking For A Missing Hiker. The Way I Found Him Will Haunt Me Forever.,"I’ve been a park ranger in Mount Hood National Forest for over a decade, and nothing has ever truly shaken me. Sure, there are the occasional lost hikers, a few wild animal sightings, but nothing out of the ordinary. That changed a few weeks ago.

It started with a missing person’s report. A hiker had gone out alone on the Timberline Trail, and his wife called in a panic. He was supposed to be back by 5 pm, but it was now 7, and he wasn’t answering his phone. Something about the way she sounded—frantic, desperate—told me this wasn’t just a case of someone losing track of time.

I took the night shift patrol to search for them. The air was cold, thick with fog, and the trees stood like silent sentinels, blocking out most of the moonlight. As I ventured deeper into the woods, a deep unease settled in my chest. It was too quiet. The usual sounds of rustling leaves or animal calls were absent.

I followed the trail, each step crunching on the frost-covered ground, the silence pressing in around me. The usual sounds of the forest—distant calls of owls, the rustle of small creatures in the underbrush—were absent, replaced by an unnerving stillness.

Then I found it. Frantic footprints. They led off the trail, deeper into the forest. The prints were erratic, almost as if the person had been running or stumbling in a blind panic. I crouched to examine them, my flashlight cutting through the darkness. The shape of the prints was unmistakable—a hiker’s boot, a solid, worn tread. But something wasn’t right. The ground around the prints was disturbed, torn up as though something had been dragged along with them.

I followed the trail further, the hairs on the back of my neck standing up. But then I found something worse. Another set of prints. Larger. Much larger. And not human. They were too deep—and they spread unnaturally wide, the toes splayed out like claws. The earth around them was torn as though whatever left them had been moving with immense weight and power.

I felt the cold sweat on my brow, but I couldn’t stop now. Something wasn’t right, and I needed answers. The prints led further off the path, into the darker parts of the woods. The air grew heavier, the fog thicker, and for the first time in years, I regretted being out here alone.

I hesitated at the edge of the steep hillside, my boots slipping on the loose rocks as I followed the prints downward. The earth seemed to be alive, shifting beneath my feet with every step I took. And then, I saw it—a scrap of clothing, caught on a branch. It was torn, frayed at the edges, and stained with something dark. The fabric looked familiar, but it didn’t matter. What mattered was what I saw next.

The footprints of the hiker and the creature now seemed to line up perfectly, as though the thing had been stalking the person, step by agonizing step. Whatever it was, it wasn’t just following. It was hunting.

I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself as the weight of the situation bore down on me. I couldn't turn back now. I had to know what was out here, and if I could help whoever was still out there.

I moved further down the trail, careful not to lose the prints, when suddenly, a scream pierced the silence. Distant, but unmistakable. A cry of pure terror. It sent a shockwave through my chest, freezing me in place.

But then, I heard something else. A low, guttural roar, far deeper than any animal I’d ever heard. It wasn’t just a roar, though. It was mixed with the scream, as if whatever was chasing the hiker was so close, it had begun to drown out their cries. The sounds twisted together, sending a wave of ice through my veins.

I didn’t wait. I ran.

I pressed my hand against my side, feeling the cold metal of my firearm beneath my jacket. It didn’t give me much comfort, but it was the only thing I had. I kept telling myself that if the hiker was still alive, the gun might be the one thing that could make a difference—if I could find them in time. If I could stop whatever this thing was.

The sounds of the forest seemed to grow quieter as I ran, the rush of my own breath drowning out everything else. My pulse thundered in my ears, each step making my heart beat faster. I had to focus. I had to find them.

I slowed, my chest tightening as I tried to steady my breath. My heart was pounding too loudly now, and I was beginning to lose track of the sounds that had been guiding me. I listened intently, straining to hear anything, but the woods were eerily silent. No more screams, no more growls—just the sound of my own feet crunching the underbrush.

The gulley opened up, and the fog seemed to thicken. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, a primal instinct warning me that something was very wrong. I stepped into the small clearing, shining my flashlight across the ground, scanning for any signs. My stomach twisted when I saw it—the signs of a struggle. Broken branches. Trampled ground. Torn-up dirt.

And then, I saw the fabric. Bloodstained, torn to shreds, lying in the grass like it had been discarded. I couldn’t breathe for a second as I crouched down beside it. The fabric was too familiar—it was the same as the scrap I had found earlier. This was real. The hiker was here. And they were hurt.

I fought to stay calm, but my mind was racing. This person wasn’t just lost. They were being hunted. I could feel it deep in my gut, that sickening certainty. I had to keep going, had to find them before it was too late.

But as I scanned the clearing, the silence grew heavier, more oppressive. Like something was watching me.

I kept searching, my eyes darting around the clearing, every muscle in my body tense, but all I could hear was the wind rustling through the trees. The silence was deafening, heavy, as though the forest itself was holding its breath. But then, I heard it—a gnarled, sickening crunch. A sound that made my blood run cold.

I whipped around, flashlight in hand, the beam cutting through the darkness. My breath caught in my throat as my eyes locked onto the unimaginable scene just beyond the treeline. There, lying in the shadows, was the hiker. Or what was left of him. His body was mangled, torn open like a ragdoll, his entrails spilled across the ground in a sickening display of brutality.

But worse than the body, worse than the blood, was the thing crouching behind him.

The creature was massive, its hulking form towering over the shredded remains of the hiker. Its body was covered in matted, dark hair, thick and wild. Its head bobbed with each sickening crunch it made, the sound of bones breaking echoing through the night air. I could barely comprehend what I was seeing.

Then it turned its head, its eyes locking with mine. Those eyes—they weren’t like anything I had ever seen. Dark, empty, and full of hunger.

Its mouth was a grotesque thing, stretched wide with sharp, jagged teeth, glistening with blood. The stench of it hit me like a wave, rancid and foul. In its clawed hands, it held the hiker’s legs, tearing through them with a grotesque ease. The creature chewed through bone like it was nothing more than celery, its mouth moving with mechanical hunger.

I stood frozen, too terrified to even breathe. The light from my flashlight wavered in my shaking hands as I tried to process what I was seeing. There was no mistaking it. This thing wasn’t some animal or wild creature. It was something far worse, something far older.

And it had seen me.

The creature let out a shriek, a high-pitched, piercing scream that rattled through my skull, making my ears feel like they were going to burst. It was a sound so unnatural, so horrible, that I thought I might lose my hearing entirely. Before I could even react, the thing launched itself toward me with terrifying speed.

I fumbled for my gun, heart hammering in my chest as I drew it. My hands were shaking, but I forced them steady. As it closed the distance, I fired. The first shot hit its shoulder, but the beast didn’t falter. I squeezed off another shot, and this time, the bullet slammed into its massive chest.

The creature stopped, its body jerking back from the impact, a guttural cry of pain escaping its monstrous mouth. For a moment, I thought it might charge again, but instead, it turned and fled into the woods. The sound of its massive frame crashing through the trees, snapping branches and uprooting saplings, echoed long after it had disappeared.

I stood there, frozen, my breath ragged in my chest, the adrenaline surging through me. My heart pounded in my ears as I listened for any sign of it returning. Silence. Nothing but the faint rustle of the wind.

I slowly lowered my gun, still on edge. I glanced back at the hiker’s remains—his torn, mutilated body—a horrible reminder of the nightmare this forest had become. The peaceful trails I had once loved were now tainted with blood, with terror.

The weight of what had just happened crashed down on me. I forced myself to take note of my location, marking the spot where the creature had attacked. I wasn’t about to leave the area unguarded, but I had to get back to the station, to report what had happened.

With slow, deliberate steps, I began making my way back, keeping my gun drawn, my senses heightened. Every shadow in the forest seemed to move, every sound felt like a threat. The night had become a living nightmare. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something else was watching me, waiting for its chance.

I arrived back at the station, every muscle in my body tight with tension, but nothing compared to the relief I felt when I stepped inside, the lights flickering on and casting a warm glow over the walls. I reported everything to my superior—every detail of the creature, the screams, the blood, the way it had attacked the hiker. He didn’t question me, didn’t even seem surprised. He just took it in, his face growing pale as I spoke.

By the time I finished, it was already 9pm. He apologized, told me I’d have to stay put and give my statement to the authorities. I nodded absently, too tired to argue. It didn’t matter to me how long I had to wait. I was back in the safety of the station, out of the woods, away from that... thing.

The night dragged on in a haze of exhaustion and dread. My mind couldn’t shake the image of the creature, its monstrous form, the way it had looked at me with those empty, bloodshot eyes. I kept telling myself that I was safe now, that nothing could touch me here.

But when the vehicles finally arrived, my relief turned to confusion. I had been expecting local police, maybe an ambulance for the poor hiker, but what I saw instead made my blood run cold.

Two black SUVs pulled up to the station, their tires crunching on the gravel as they came to a halt. The men who stepped out weren’t in uniform. They wore sharp, black clothing, sleek and professional, their faces hidden behind dark sunglasses despite the late hour. They moved with a quiet, deliberate precision, like wolves hunting in the night.

I felt a chill crawl down my spine as one of the men approached. He didn’t introduce himself. Didn’t offer a hand. Just stared at me for a moment, his eyes hidden behind dark glasses.

""Are you the ranger who encountered it?"" he asked in a voice that was too calm, too controlled.

I nodded, unsure of what to make of him, of them.

""Good,"" he said, turning back to his colleagues. ""We’ll take it from here.""

It wasn’t until then that I realized what was happening. These weren’t local authorities. They weren’t even from around here. Their presence, their demeanor, was unsettling, like they had known this was coming. Like they had been waiting for someone like me to find the creature. And now that I had, they were going to take control of everything.

I stayed silent, my mind racing with questions, but before I could say anything, the man spoke again.

""Your statement will be taken. You will be briefed later. We handle things like this.""

I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach. There was no room for questions, no room for doubt. They had been waiting for this. Whatever this thing was, it was something more than just a creature in the woods. And I had no idea how deep it went.

After giving my statement, I tried to ask them questions. I needed answers, needed to understand what was going on, but each of them just looked at me—stoic, emotionless, like they had heard it all before. Their eyes were cold, unreadable. They said nothing.

Instead, one of the men reached into his jacket and pulled out a document, sliding it across the table toward me. It was a non-disclosure agreement—an NDA. The words on the paper blurred together as I tried to read, but I could barely focus. They wanted me to sign it. To keep everything I had seen, everything I had learned, a secret. Forever.

I stared at the document, my hands shaking. I didn’t want to sign it. I couldn’t. But the way they looked at me, the way their eyes locked onto mine with an intensity that spoke of things far darker than I could understand, told me I had no choice. The weight of their silence hung heavy in the air.

They weren’t asking. They were telling.

I took the pen. My fingers trembled as I signed the paper, each stroke of ink feeling like a surrender, a piece of my soul being locked away. The man nodded as I finished, sliding the document back into his folder without a word.

But then, he handed me another piece of paper. This one was different. It had details written in tight, precise handwriting. A story for me to tell, one that would be fed to the authorities if I ever dared to speak the truth.

The man suffered a bear attack. I arrived too late to stop it. That’s what I was supposed to say. Nothing about the creature. Nothing about the blood, the screams, the twisted horror I had witnessed.

I looked down at the paper, a sickening twist in my stomach. The lie was laid out in front of me, and it tasted like metal on my tongue. I was supposed to accept it. I had no choice but to accept it.

I nodded, my voice caught in my throat as I silently accepted the agreement. I wasn’t sure what was worse—the horror of what I had seen, or the realization that I was now a part of something far bigger than I could ever understand. And I was expected to stay silent. To forget.

But I couldn’t. Not completely. Something in me refused to believe that this was over.

After that night, I quit being a ranger. I couldn’t stay in that job anymore—not after everything I had seen, everything I had been forced to bury. I tried to move on, to forget, but the nightmares never stopped. Sometimes, I lie awake in the dark, hearing the man’s awful screams echoing in my head. I see the creature—its massive, blood-soaked mouth, chewing through his thighbone like it was nothing more than a twig. The sound of it still haunts me.

What breaks me even more is the thought of that man’s poor wife, never knowing the truth of what happened to her husband. I can still hear her voice on the phone, frantic with worry. The guilt gnaws at me because I couldn't give her the closure she deserved. She’ll never know what really happened, and that thought weighs on me more than anything else.

I used to love the woods. I was an avid hiker, a lover of wildlife and nature. The forest was a sanctuary for me. But now, after what I saw, I can never look at it the same way again. The smell of pine and damp earth now just reminds me of the blood and the hunger lurking in the shadows.

I’m writing this now, trying to finally get it out of my head, because I can’t live with the images anymore. I fear they’ll find out I’ve breached the NDA, and when they do, I know they’ll come after me. They don’t let people like me talk. But I can’t keep living with this torment.

If you’re reading this, stay out of the forest. Please. It’s not what it seems. And if you must go... be sure to go armed. You never know what might be lurking out there, waiting for you. It’s not just the trees that can hurt you. The woods are full of things that should never be seen, things that are better left [undiscovered.](https://youtu.be/yqtlxlol0uI?si=6XohNKTX_iowYMqk)",301,0.94,26,InformationRemote865,2024-11-11 23:19:00,1gpdhv0,327,High
NoSleep,The Other,"My name is Claire, this happened to me just over ten years ago now. If I’m going to tell this story, then I’m going to tell it right.

When I was in my early thirties, my husband passed away. He was driving home one night from a long day of work when a drunk driver hit his car. From what the coroner told me, he died on impact. And the state of his car was in shambles, the driver’s side was completely crumpled in. I was distraught with grief, and my then-six-year-old son, Tommy “Tom” didn’t understand what was happening. He kept asking where his daddy was and I had to tell him that daddy wasn’t coming back home. 

A year after my husband’s passing, we moved away. I couldn’t stay in that house anymore. We ended up selling it and moving to a small town just two states away in Indiana. I won’t say the name of the town, as I don’t want this to happen to anyone else. 
The house we moved into was a small, remote house that almost resembled a cabin. The interior walls were made up of dark wood paneling, and it reminded me of my grandparent’s house. That’s why I wanted to move there in the first place. Somewhere that felt familiar. The house had some distance from the neighbors, which I liked. Behind our home were thick woods that went on for miles, and I remember telling Tommy to never go into those woods unless I said it was okay. 

For the first year that we lived in that house, everything was normal. Although, Tommy was struggling to make friends at school. I can’t say that I blame him, he took his father’s death very rough and maybe that is why he would go on to disobey me in the next few years. I didn’t make friends any quicker than he did and most days I would find myself gardening to pass the time. That was something that I didn’t do before my husband died. I think it was a way for me to have some control over something, whether a plant lived or died depended on me. It calmed me and it made me happy to be able to do something good. 

I was in the backyard one afternoon while Tommy was at school. I was watering my lilies. It is important to note the layout of our backyard. Upon exiting the backdoor, you step out onto the patio which was layered with clay bricks on the ground. They were put in long ago and some were loose and would shake when I would step on them. Then almost against the wall of the house was where my flowers would be. I would often have my back facing away from the woods when I would water my plants. That specific afternoon, I was listening to music on my MP3 player as I tended to the flowers, and I thought I heard something. I thought I heard people talking. But not just people, but children. I pulled out my earbuds and listened closely. I could hear the murmurs of children whispering. I couldn’t make out what they were saying. I would try to write it out but it would just read like gibberish. And that’s what I thought it was, just gibberish. But it was children, there was no doubt about that. I turned around and faced the woods. 

“You kids should be in school!” I called out

the whispering stopped. 

There was nothing but the sound of a light breeze in the air. But the sudden silence of the children made my skin go cold. Usually, children liked to mess around and disobey adults, which is why it was so peculiar that they stopped talking about whatever it was that they were talking about. Nothing like that happened for a while, until a month later.


I was lying in bed one night, my window was cracked open because it was July and the summer heat made our house unbearably hot. I kept the screen of the window closed, as I didn’t want mosquitoes to infest our home. While I lay in bed, I thought I could hear something outside. It again, sounded like the whispers of children. But now, instead of there just being whispers, there was giggling too. The soft sound of children giggling. Something that I was very familiar with. But hearing that in the dead of night was chilling. It all happened so quickly. The next thing I heard was the sound of Tommy giggling from his bedroom. 

I sprang out of bed and ran to Tommy’s room, opening the bedroom door to see Tommy staring out of his bedroom window. His small body was illuminated by the moonlight. He giggled again at something that I didn’t see. 

“Thomas? What are you doing up?” I asked

Tommy turned to face me.

“The kids momma, the kids are here” he replied giggling.

I froze in place and goosebumps began to form on my bare arms. I ran to the window, looking out to see what Tommy was seeing. And I saw them too. Kids were walking into the woods behind our house. They must have been at Tommy’s window. I didn’t get a good look at the kids, but I could tell from the silhouettes of their bodies that they were children. Some are taller than others. 

“Tommy, honey… who were those kids?” I asked

“the kids from the grove Mommy” Tommy replied

“the grove? What’s the grove, honey?” I questioned

“it’s where they live.”

Tommy slept in my bed that night, I couldn’t sleep after that and stayed up to watch the windows, making sure those kids wouldn’t come back. 


Nothing happened for another two years. 

The next event that happened was similar to the first encounter that I had with the whispers. 

I was in the backyard gardening again. Tommy was at a friend’s house, it was a Friday and if I am being honest, I didn’t want to see him for the rest of the day. We had gotten into an argument that morning and he said some things to me that I’d rather not repeat. 

While I was gardening, I heard the snapping of twigs behind me, near the woods.

Snap

Crack

I turned, gasping as I did so. 

I came face to face with an older gentleman who threw his arms up as if he had been caught.

“W-who are you?” I asked

“My name is Allen, I’m your neighbor I guess” he replied

“you guess?” 

“I didn’t know that anyone lived here, I haven’t seen you at all.”

It didn’t make any sense, how could he not have known that we live here?

“You didn’t know? We’ve been living here for nearly three years” I exclaimed

He paused for a moment.

“Well, your house is surrounded by woods on all sides and I never usually pass by your house unless I have to” he tried to reason for why he was standing in my backyard. I looked at him for a moment. His face was worn with wrinkles from stress over the years and his eyes darted to his left toward the trees, as if he were paranoid.

“Why were you in the woods?” I asked unconsciously

“I decided to go on a walk this afternoon, I haven’t been in these old woods in a long time. Which reminds me” he stopped for a moment.

“Be careful in these woods, a lot of strange things in there.” 

He waved and walked back into the woods, back onto the trail. The entire scenario perplexed me, I didn’t understand what he meant and at the time, I hadn’t even thought of what had happened a few years prior. But after thinking about it, I now understood what Allen had meant. He wasn’t talking about animal noises or anything like that. He was talking about the children in the woods. 

Everything changed after Tommy turned nine. After school one day, we got into a heated argument about him not cleaning his room. Tommy was upset and packed a bag full of clothes and walked out of the back door and into the woods. He said that he was running away. I let him. Looking back now, it wasn’t the right decision. But I did the same thing at his age, and all he needed to do was go outside and let off some steam. But when he didn’t return by sundown, I knew something was wrong. Panicked, I grabbed a flashlight and ran into those old woods. 

I ran down the trail, calling for him and I weaved out of the way of overhanging tree branches. I was distraught and thought of the possibility of him being lost in the woods. I didn’t want to think about it. But the woods were thick and went on for miles, the thought of him out there gave me a fear that I didn’t know I had. I ran for what felt like hours.

As I was running through the woods, I kept hearing the familiar sound of children whispering, giggling, and laughing. I stopped and turned in circles again and again. But I couldn’t see anyone through the brush. But I could hear them cackling.

I continued to run down the path until my flashlight caught something just off of the trail, like a deer in headlights. It was nearly hidden out of view. It was Tommy’s shirt. He was wearing a black T-shirt with the Batman logo on it. But now it was in the leaves. I grabbed it and quickly examined it. The back of the shirt was torn, it had a big hole, almost appearing like there was no back to the shirt.

“Mom?” Tommy called out in the distance.

I dropped the shirt and ran quickly in the direction of his voice.

“Tommy!” I shouted, my voice echoed through the woods.

My flashlight caught him, shirtless, standing in the middle of the trail. He raised his hand over his eyes, and I lowered the flashlight, not wanting to blind him. 

“Tommy, are you okay? What happened?” I asked

“M-my s-shirt got c-caught” he struggled to speak. 

I guided him out of the woods and back into the house. Tommy didn’t speak for weeks after that night. I had to plead with him just to tell me goodnight. I had to send him to a psychiatrist, who eventually told me that Tommy may have suffered some trauma from being lost in the woods. 

It took Tommy seven months before he spoke again. 


Tommy turned seventeen, and things began to change with him. He didn’t hang out with any kids after school, and sometimes I would catch him in the backyard, just staring into the woods. I knew that what had happened to him was traumatic but I thought he overcame that memory. As the weeks passed on, I kept noticing Tommy’s strange behavior. Sometimes, I would catch him watching me from around the corner as I cooked dinner. When I would catch him, he wouldn’t be smiling or anything. He would just stare with a blank expression on his face. 

I didn’t understand the surfacing of the behavior. He was always very private before he turned seventeen. He would always be in his room. And maybe he wanted me to think that he was still doing that. Maybe he didn’t know that I could him several times, staring at me. 

One day, after school, he told me that he was going on a hike in the woods. I said that it was okay. And as I grabbed his backpack to bring it into his room, one of his notebooks fell out. I bent over to pick it up and when I did, it was open. In the notebook there were no notes from his classes, it was drawings. I didn’t understand them.

One of the drawings was of him standing in the woods, and next to him was a black tree and what I think was a face in the tree.

Then next page revealed another drawing of the tree digesting what looked like a woman. The tree had a wide mouth with wooden teeth that bit down on the lower torso of a person. It didn’t make any sense. Why would he draw something like that? Are these nightmares that he had after that night in the woods? Did he draw them when he woke up? 

I did not understand where this sudden change in behavior came from. Tommy had problems, that much I knew. He was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety when he was fourteen. But this was something entirely different.

Then, one night while I was laying in bed, attempting to fall asleep. I laid on my side, facing the doorway. The bedroom door was cracked and my bedroom window was cracked as well, letting in the cool air in the autumn night. 

I thought that I noticed something in the crack of my bedroom door, I squinted my eyes, attempting to get a clear view of what I was seeing. It was… Tommy. He was standing outside of my bedroom door, staring in. What horrified me more was what Tommy was wearing or what he wasn’t wearing. When he saw that I noticed the lack of clothing, he barged into the room. After that night, I knew that this person wasn’t my son.

I spent the next two days throwing up on and off all day. And I considered taking my own life after that. Leaving whoever that person was behind. 

But when I realized that I couldn’t do that, that I couldn’t just kill myself, I knew that I had to do something. And I confronted Tommy.

He had skipped school that day and went into the woods, he didn’t return for hours until he finally emerged. When he did, I asked him to come inside and sit down. I had a knife hidden up my sleeve, knowing that I was either going to get answers about where the real Tommy was or I would have to kill him.

He sat down on the sofa across from me as I sat in the loveseat. He smiled as I sat down, staring at my breasts. 

“Tommy, do you know what you did?” I asked

He smiled, “I showed you love” he replied

I wanted to vomit.

“No Tommy, that was not love. That was hate, that was… it was evil.”

“What do you mean, mother?” he asked

I paused for a moment, not wanting to remember that night.

“Tommy, you violated me.”

He didn’t speak, he just smiled as he watched me in my vulnerable state.

“My son would never do that to me.”

His smile faded.

“You are not my son.” I muttered and lunged at him with the knife.

Tommy was quick, he stuck out his feet, propelling me into the air and tossing me behind the sofa. I landed on my back, dropping the knife as it skid across the floor. I groaned and reached for my back. He had thrown me so hard that I thought that I broke my spine. 

“You stupid bitch” he let out in a gutteral tone, sounding like he wasn’t human.

He stood over me, his fists bawled. He crouched down, getting to my level.

“You had it coming, you stupid whore” 

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, he wrapped his hands around my neck, tensing his muscles so that my breath would slow.

“You know, you were right about one thing… I’m not your son.”

My face began to turn from a light red, to a dark purple.

“I’m surprised you didn’t figure it out sooner.”

A shot rang out. The other Tommy’s grip loosened as he collapsed to the ground, a black sludge gushed from the open hole in his forehead. I gasped for air, looking over to the front door to see my neighbor, Allen, standing there with his rifle.

“You okay?” he asked

I sat up, gripping my throat and catching my breath.

“Yeah, I’m okay” I replied. 

I glanced at the body, and was unsettled to see that it started to wither away, the skin began to shrink, turning a light grey, to a charcoal black. Until eventually, there was no skin at all, not even a skeleton, but instead there was what looked like dirt, and tree bark. 

“What the fuck was he?” I asked

Allen stood over the mound of dirt.

“I don’t know for sure, but he wasn’t human. He was a copycat”

“A copycat?” I asked

“The thing that lives in those woods, it makes them. It happened to my daughter, whatever it was, it ate her, and it spat out a copycat.” 

It’s been ten years since that day, I moved out shortly after. I reported my son as missing but I knew that he had been dead for years. Allen was there for me, he told me that he never told me about the thing in the woods because I wouldn’t believe him. But he did warn me. Now, I have to live, knowing that my son died years ago, alone, and scared. 

I’ve had my own theories over the years of what the truth may have been. The drawings that the copycat drew, it was of a person being eaten by a tree. That is what I believe makes the copycats. I don’t know what their purpose was, whether it was to cause chaos or if it was to make more of them. Either way, I have been in therapy for years for what happened. And even though he wasn’t my real son, he still had his face. So after having nightmares about him violating me, I went to therapy. I am doing much better now. Allen lost his wife before Tommy and I moved in, and we eventually started a relationship together. We decided that we didn’t want to get married or have children. But we’re happy most days, and we deal with the trauma together. ",39,0.89,3,Goodcoffee03,2024-11-12 06:57:27,1gpk3s1,42,High
NoSleep,I’m A Rookie With The Winchester Police Department Supernatural’s Division: This Is Beginning To Be The Strangest Case I’ve Worked Yet,"[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gfkkpn/im_a_rookie_with_the_winchester_police_department/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gljtwb/im_a_rookie_with_the_winchester_police_department/)

After extensive testing and a thorough examination, Detective Davidson has been officially cleared of possession.

That’s right, Demon Dan has successfully vacated his system, leaving Dustin with only *slight* psychological damage.

(If you're new, you can find what my therapy sessions have covered: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpnsAthenaeum/s/uy48wEsac9)

He doesn’t remember much about the few hours he was shoved into shotgun or how he ended up getting possessed in the first place. All he’s told me is that he remembers feeling really cold and angry. Overall, it was an unpleasant experience, one he wouldn’t wish upon his own worst enemy.

On a totally unrelated note, the division will be holding a mandatory training seminar on the proper precautions to take to protect against possession in the very near future. Yes, I know it’s a mouthful. It was rather enjoyable to see Lieutenant Dawn struggle to read the memo out as he went around announcing it to everyone.

Salt, iron, holy water, a cross, and The Bible are great basic items to have in your possession at all times. If you’re a little more paranoid, or extreme, there are more *permanent* precautions. Like a protective tattoo for example. There was a certain tv show that circulated it around a couple years ago, now that I think about it.

Dustin is seriously debating getting one of these tattoo’s. He has a couple on his forearms that I’ve seen on occasion when his sleeves are pushed up. A purple butterfly and a rose I think. They’re small, but I’m sure meaningful. It might also just be an excuse to get another tattoo though, the symbol is pretty cool looking not gonna lie. That, or he’s more irked by that experience than he’s letting on.

As you can see, we take possession and more importantly precaution, very seriously at the Winchester Police Department Supernatural’s Division. Here, it will literally save your life if you come prepared for anything that might jump out and attack you.

I’m back at work, by the way, if that weren’t obvious already. How’s it going?

Well, if you were to ask me which supernatural cases I hate dealing with the most, I’d say anything involving vampires. They’re gruesome creatures, ruthless and cut throat. They’re even rarer than sirens, so when one pops up it’s a whole annoying mess to deal with. Like an actual mess. When a particularly out of control vampire feeds, it turns into a bloodbath.

And lucky me, I just can’t catch a fucking break. As soon as I set foot back in the precinct, Davidson and I were handed the case of a suspected supernatural serial killer.

In layman’s terms, three murders that share common characteristics and have a cool down period between each kill can be classified as serial murders. The first two victim’s, an older woman and a young man, were all drained of blood and their throats ripped out- classic vampire M.O. The most recent murder of a little girl made three. Like I said, I *hate* vampires.

Dustin and I got to the scene a little after three pm, taking over for the first responding officer. The girl’s body had been found in an alleyway, resting by an overflowing dumpster. The crime scene was cordoned off with that classic yellow tape, a small gathering of curious bystanders on the other side, balancing on the tips of their toes in hopes of seeing something.

The girl’s skin was pale and her little shirt was drenched in blood, throat torn to shreds. Her eyes had glazed over, the life completely drained from them. A permanent expression of terror frozen on her face as her mouth hung open from screaming out her last breath. To throw salt in the wound, a pesky fly crawled in and out of her mouth and on the skin of her face.

She’d been exsanguinated of blood, so lividity wouldn’t be an indicating factor of time of death here. But, based on the fact her jaw still hung open, Rigor Mortis hadn’t set in yet. The stench of sickly sweet iron was too strong for this to have occurred a day or two ago. That meant the body had been fresh, killed only a couple hours ago.

A vamp killing in broad daylight. Bold, but not entirely unheard of.

Lana was the girl’s name. It was written on her purple backpack. There was one of those emergency contact cards in there with the parent’s information as well.

I stood there staring down at the little girl as  a pair of blue latex gloves snapped on the skin on my hands. The background noise of the crime scene investigators, other officers, bystanders, cars, even the nature around the city seemed to fade into nothing the longer I concentrated on Lana. It was just me and her in the world, nobody else.

She reminded me a bit of myself at that age, probably because of the long black hair she had tied up into a ponytail. I also had a purple backpack in elementary school.

A tear slid down my cheek as I mourned for the girl. Lana was so young, had her whole life ahead of her, only for it to be ripped away in an instant. Her promising life in exchange to keep a greedy monster’s appetite at bay. Despicable. She was just a kid walking home from school.

A hot flash of rage swept through my body.

Then a facial muscle in her cheek twitched. Startled, I jumped back, screaming, **“No!”**

After my outburst, the activity around the busy crime scene ceased, everyone’s eyes pointed at me. My partner dropped what he was doing and made his way over to me.

I took multiple steps back, my eyes trained on the unmoving corpse. Uncontrollable tears gushed down my face. Panic gripped my heart, like a vice. Quick shallow breaths left my lungs. My head was spinning. It felt like I was going to die.

Thanks to all my therapy sessions, I recognized it as a panic attack.

Needing to remove myself from the situation, I ducked under the crime scene tape and booked it back to the liftback- Dustin en tow.

I slammed the passenger door shut and locked the car, rolling down my window to let the fresh air in. A slight breeze whooshed in, settling my nerves a little.

Dustin leaned against the vehicle with one arm resting on top of the roof and the other on his hip. He looked down at me with concern. “You good?”

“I will be,” I said with a shuddering breath. My wrists flailed around erratically as I attempted to shake the shock out of my system. I wiped drying tears off my face with my sweaty palms after taking the gloves off.

Dustin pat the top of the liftback twice. “Okay,” he said nonchalantly, walking back over to the crime scene.

Detective Davison was a dear and conducted interviews while I calmed down in his car. Then, together we went around to the surrounding local businesses and requested they hand over any CCTV footage they might have.

While most of the owners were happy to oblige, a couple of them told us to fuck off and come back with a warrant. God, I love small town Michigan. The grit on some of these folks reminded me of the Windy City.

With witness statements, interview notes, and a good bit of security tapes to sift through, Dustin and I headed back to the comfort of the precinct.

The first couple minutes of the car ride were silent. “What was that back there?” Davidson asked, breaking it.

I clicked my tongue against the roof of my mouth. “Would you believe it if I said it was first day back jitters?”

He shot me a quick, stern, glance. “Lucky…”

“I don’t want to talk about it,” my whole body shifted away from him and his gaze as my neck turned to face out the window. I crossed my arms and huffed.

Dustin sighed before he sincerely said, “If you ever *do* want to talk about it, I’m here.”

“Are you ever going to tell me what you really went through while you were possessed?” I mumbled into my chest. After peeking over my shoulder, I found him looking stone faced with his lips pressed together in a hard line.

An awkward silence filled the air between us. The tension grew so thick, you could cut it with a knife.

Then Clair de Lune, Dustin’s ringtone, started playing. He fumbled for a second, reaching around for his phone while keeping his eyes on the road. I rolled my eyes before leaning over and grabbing it out of the center console for him.

“Hey,” Dustin said as he answered the phone, putting it on speaker, “are you thinking what we’re thinking?”

“A vampire? Possibly, yes,” Jane’s semi-muffled voice rang out. Just like his car, Dustin’s phone was old. His model was a good two, three, maybe ten updates behind modern technological standards. “But there’s also the possibility it could be-“

“No,” Dustin cut her off. I shook my head in agreement. Nobody wanted the alternative to be the case. *Especially* me.

A slightly offended pause came from the phone. “I was just saying it’s a possibility. But, yeah, the supernatural we’re most likely dealing with here is a vampire.”

“Great,” I said unenthusiastically, earning yet another glare from my partner.

“Well we’re on our way back to the precinct now,” he informed. “The three of us can sit down and create a profile when we get there.”

“Alrighty then,” Jane said chipperly, “see you soon.” She then promptly hung up the phone.

The rest of the car ride was drowned out with the stale sound of FM radio.

Back at the precinct Jane, Dustin, and I met up and sat down in one of the conference rooms to start working on this profile. Files and papers were scattered and askew all over the large table as we searched for our killers pattern or something to tie the victims together.

Our victims were an old woman, a young man, and a child. Most vampires either have a specific type of person/gender they prefer to drink from. They also typically target almost middle aged to young folk since they tend to be the healthiest of the crop, so to speak. A small portion of the species, however, will drink from anything that lives and breathes. These cretins are the ones we come in contact with most. Based on what we already had, we knew we were dealing with one of the less civilized vamps.

We just needed some sort of connection between the victims that could lead to clues or a pattern that would identify our suspect.

The first victim, Gladys Stokes, was a sixty-five year old widow. Since her kids were all off living their own lives, she spent most of her time down at the animal shelter volunteering. Last week she was found with her throat torn out behind the shelter. Initially, her death was ruled as an animal attack because of the brutality and bite marks. There’s a big wolf and coyote population that live in the woods that surround Winchester. Occasionally, they’re prone to attack, especially if they feel like their territory is being threatened. The animal shelter is located on the edge of the woods so this was a pretty plausible explanation. However, the division would re-open her case and start a death investigation once the serial killer struck again.

Twenty-four year old Shane Embers was the second victim. His body was found in one of the student labs at the hospital with injuries consistent with Gladys a couple days later. Throat ripped to pieces and drained of blood. The coroner highly doubted that a wolf would be able to get inside the hospital, kill a nursing student, and get out completely unnoticed. That’s when he notified Lieutenant Dawn of a possible supernatural going around killing people.

Then of course there’s Lana…

The first connection we ruled out was that they were blood relatives. None of the victims lived remotely close or even knew each other. The next connection to go was religion. Embers was an adamant atheist and Gladys and Lana’s churches were on the opposite side of town.

Pretty much nothing connected our vic’s to one another. This guy was seriously starting to remind me of The Night Stalker.

Jane was definitely the most frustrated out of all of us. She was hardly ever stumped when it came to profiling. It came as easy and natural to her as breathing.

“O-kay! Who wants coffee?” I yelled out nervously after Jane slammed her fist on the conference table particularly hard. The woman was elegant and poise, very rarely did she get temperamental. At least that’s what I’ve noticed in the time since I’ve been here.

Jane didn’t get a choice, she was getting coffee. Dustin, who was nose deep in a file, waved me off. I shrugged my shoulders and left the room.

Lieutenant Dawn cornered me in the kitchen as I brewed Jane’s cup. “How you feeling?” He asked.

I shrugged, pouring a couple table spoons of sugar in my empty mug. “Better.”

Dawn took a step back after he heard my answer, easing the intimidating presence I felt breathing down my neck. “Anything you wanna tell me?”

“Nope,” my lips made a popping sound as I pronounced the p. The coffee machine beeped as Jane’s mug finished brewing. I switched her mug out for mine, adding nothing in hers since she takes it black.

Dawn reached for the cabinet above my head, grabbing an oatmeal cream pie from the snack bin. He ripped open the plastic packaging and took a bite, taking half of the treat with him.

“You will tell me if something happens, right? To you, your partner, even if something bothers you and it’s the smallest thing?”

A forced smile made its way into my face as I turned to my superior. I gave the man a quick two finger salute “Yes sir. I wouldn’t be doing my due diligence if I didn’t.”

Dawn stifled a laugh and rolled his eyes. He ruffled my hair up before walking off with his sweet treat, like he was my dad.

I let out a sigh of relief as I fixed the new flyaways my lieutenant had given me. The space felt more comfortable now that I was alone in it. A good amount of cream was poured into my mug before I carefully made my way back to the conference room.

“Aha!” Jane shouted victoriously, jumping up and down excitedly as I pushed the door to the conference room open with my shoulder.

Dustin threw the file he was reading down in surprise, clearly startled. “What? Did you find something?”

Jane accepted the warm cup of coffee with two hands graciously. She took a small sip with a fat grin. “Yes, I did, because I’m a genius!”

“You wanna share with the class?” I asked, closing the door and taking a seat. Sweet with a slight hint of bitter coffee slid down my throat, making my tummy very happy. “What did you find?”

“They’re all innocent!” Jane proclaimed, gathering up and throwing all three of our victims files open next to each other in the center of the table.

“Yeah, none of them had a criminal record,” Dustin said, leaning back in his chair. “So…?”

Jane crumpled up a blank piece of paper and chucked it at Dustin’s head. It hit his temple and ricocheted onto the floor. I laughed into my mug as I took another sip.

“The victims were morally innocent, ya dummy!” She explained. “An old woman who volunteered at an animal shelter, a young man who was studying health to help save lives, a pure of heart kindergartner that wouldn’t hurt a fly! Can’t you see it?”

“No,” Dustin said flatly. “You look kinda crazy right now.”

“Yeah,” I said, drowning Davidson’s dull answer out. “Whatever killed these people is pretty evil.” My heart sunk to the bottom of my stomach after I said that.

The division’s profiler snapped her fingers. “Exactly! These murders are so gruesome and so evil, and factoring in the victim’s innocence-“

“You can’t seriously be suggesting-“ I cut in.

Jane finished my sentence. “A revenant? Yes, that’s exactly what I’m suggesting. Our victims weren’t killed by a vampire, but a revenant!”

Revenants are a subspecies of vampires. Something goes wrong when they turn and they lose all sense of humanity and become nothing but hungry bottomless pits.

They’re worse than ghouls. They’re worse than *vampires*, and I *hate* vampires! They’re the scum of the earth. Some of the evilest, vilest, creatures on this plane of existence.

“In Winchester? *Really?*” Dustin scoffed, unbelievably.

“Why not?” Jane shrugged her shoulders suggestively and sat down. “There was one in a town only a couple hours away from here last year. That one was a serial killer too.”

I gulped. “What happened to them?”

“Well the murders stopped, so either they were captured and killed by that department’s supernatural division or he skipped town.”

Our very productive conversation was suddenly interrupted by a frantic knock on the conference room door. One of the secretaries cautiously poked her head through and addressed the room. “Detective Davison? Officer Hale? I have a lady on the line who is adamant that she speak with someone handling this case.”

“Is it urgent?” Dustin asked with a yawn.

The secretary nodded her head. “To her it is.”

Dustin sighed and started pulling himself up in his chair.

“I’ll handle it,” I said suddenly, getting up and greeting our colleague at the door. “You guys keep working on that theory.”

I then followed her to the front desk to take the phone call.

I owed it to him for taking over the crime scene earlier. Clearly he didn’t want to talk to this woman on the phone. I didn’t mind the work as this would make things fair between us. Besides, Dustin could sit through one of Jane’s yapping sessions for once. And I love how he squirms when he’s irritated, bored, and uninterested.

“This is Officer Hale, how can I help you?” I spoke into the receiver after Janine, the secretary, handed me the office phone.

“Hi, yes? I think I have information on the individual who might be responsible for some of these killings.”

“You *think* you have information, or you have information?”

The callers breath hitched in her throat, but she quickly regained herself. “I have information. I know who the killer is.”

“What’s your name, Miss? And how do you know who the killer is?” I asked, getting a pen and pad ready.

“W-well, I don’t *know* know who the killer is,” she started, “I just saw him leave the area where that little girl was found. My name is Sage Walker by the way.”

I started scribbling down her information and taking notes. “Can I get your description of the perpetrator, ma’am?”

I’d ask her why she waited so long to call this in later. Winchester is a small town so the news of local’s deaths spreads like wildfire. It was very possible she saw something suspicious but thought nothing of it at the time, only to find out later she could be a key witness.

“H-he’s a brown skinned man, about five foot five or five foot six. Dark, short hair. He was wearing dark jeans, black flannel and a light gray undershirt and was *covered* in blood!” Sage explained frantically over the phone. The more she talked the more worked up she got. She sounded really concerned.

As she continued to walk me through the man’s description, my free ear clued into the sounds surrounding the lobby.

The front door to reception slowly creeped open, heavy footsteps shuffled inside slowly.  The secretaries and other people in the lobby gasped.

“I’m here to turn myself in. I… I think I hurt someone.”

My gaze flicked to the person as their words registered in my head.

“I-I’m going to have to call you back,” I said before promptly hanging up the phone. It was like the person Ms. Walker just described had walked right out of the phone and into the precinct.

The man’s mouth and chin were stained with dry blood. His tanned skin, pale, drenched in sweat. A flannel over shirt was tied around his waste. Giant brown stains covered both the garment and his light gray undershirt. Over all the man looked, and smelled, like death.

Quickly, I raised my gun out of my holster and pointed it at the man’s head. “Get down on your knees, now!” I commanded sternly. “Put your hands behind your back!”

Sheepishly, the man did as I said. His eyes darted around the room nervously, looking extremely uncomfortable and more importantly, guilty.

That rage from earlier started bubbling up in my gut again.

After detaining him, I’d brought the man to one of our special interrogation rooms. We were as safe and secure as we could be in there. The walls were reinforced with a mix of galvanized steel and iron. All of the supernaturals were restrained using silver handcuffs. A tough and sturdy chain bound him to the interrogation table, which was welded into the ground. For extra precaution, I’d slipped some silver ankle cuffs on his legs in case he somehow managed to free himself.

An hour of interrogation later and we’d gotten absolutely nowhere.

The suspect claims he has no memory of who he is or how he got here. He seems to not even realize what he is. All he knows is that he blacks out sometimes. This last time he woke up covered in blood. Knowing what he did was bad, instinct told him to turn himself in. That’s about as far as we got before he started shutting down.

“Is this really necessary?” He asked as one of the forensic technicians scrapped dry blood off of his shirt for testing. A field test concluded the substance  was blood. Another test needed to be conducted in the lab to confirm whether it was human or not. He was then stripped of his bloodied clothes, the fabric being logged in as evidence.

“Yes,” I answered. Then, by my request, The technician carefully lifted up his lip using a gloved pinky finger, revealing a pair of sharper than normal canines.

“Are you sure he’s a revenant?” Dustin asked, leaning close and whispering. “He seems awfully… *there.* And his humanity seems to be intact.”

Right as Dustin said that, he lost control of himself. Our suspect snapped his jaw as the technician removed their hand from his mouth. If the appendage had poked around in there a second longer he’d surely have lost it. A guttural snarl left the suspects mouth as a string of drool started to drip off his lips. The technician quickly gathered their kit and got out of there, hungry eyes following them the entire time.

After a moment, our suspect shook his head, snapping himself out of whatever trance he had gone into. He stared down at his hands shamefully. “Sorry.”

Vampires are rare, revenants even rarer. But a lucid one? Now that’s completely unheard of.

But there I was, staring one in the eyes. They were bloodshot and his pupils were dilated. I’d come across a revenant once before… his eyes were the same.

An unwanted image flashed in my mind. I blinked and shook the memory away. “So what should we call you, revenant?” I asked, leaning over the table to get a better analysis on him.

The man squirmed in his seat under my watchful gaze. Then, timidly, he thought on it for a few seconds before responding, “I’ve always liked the name Rudy?”",51,0.89,1,spnsuperfan1,2024-11-12 00:35:13,1gpenh8,52,High
NoSleep,We've been working onboard a secret space station for the past two weeks. I don't think we're alone out here. ,"“Captain, do you have a moment?” Henderson asked quietly, concern clearly present in his eyes. “It’s Levi. He’s not doing too hot.”

I sighed, still not sure what to make of the situation. He’d been out of it for the past twenty-four hours, and mission control hadn’t yet been informed regarding his status.

“Let’s talk to him again,” I suggested.

I glanced out through the window, staring down at Earth’s brilliant, blue shine below. We were more than five hundred kilometers up in the atmosphere, and should a medical emergency arise, we weren’t equipped to handle it, but notifying our superiors would mean a premature end to our journey. It wasn’t a choice I would make lightly. With no one back on Earth even aware of our covert mission, we couldn’t afford a do-over.

We pushed our way through the station, floating around corners towards our bedchambers at the station’s rear end. Levi had been confined to his room since he started displaying symptoms, but in spite of his poor mental state, he had not yet made an attempt to leave his room.

He sat against the wall, sobbing quietly, not taking the time to acknowledge our presence.

“Levi, how are you holding up?” I asked as comfortingly as I could.

“We have to find her. She has to be out there. She’s not gone,” he mumbled to himself.

“Find whom?” I asked.

“Why are you pretending like you don’t know,” he went on. “Carey is out there. She needs us.”

I glanced over at Henderson. We shared a confused expression before redirecting our attention back to Levi. His eyes were bloodshot, heavy bags lining their underside. Even under heavy sedation, he hadn’t slept a single minute.

“Levi—” I began, “there is no Carey. There’s just the four of us here, and we haven’t had an EVA in over a week. There’s no one outside. There can’t be.”

“How can you say that? How can you look me in the eyes and pretend like you don’t know?”

It was a discussion we’d had on more than one occasion in the past day, repeating it would only serve to exhaust all of us. And getting increasingly worried by the minute, we excused ourselves and locked him back inside his room. Though stuck in his bizarre delusion, Levi made no attempt to resist his confinement.

We returned to the bridge, where Adriana Lowe was waiting for orders on what to do next.

“What do you think?” I asked.

“Mental break?” Henderson suggested. “I just don’t know what set it off.”

“What about a tumor? Neurological disorder?” Lowe asked.

“The company put us through a barrage of medical tests, including an MRI. Unless he grew a brain tumor in the past two weeks, that ain’t it,” Henderson replied. “It’s only been a day, and—”

Henderson was interrupted mid-sentence by a bang reverberating throughout the station, appearing to originate from the outer hull.  

“What the hell was that? Did we just get his by something?” Lowe asked.

“Not a chance, anything up here would have torn through the exterior,” I replied. “Check the computer. Confirm that nothing’s malfunctioning.”

Lowe pulled herself over to the control panel and started performing a system’s check. Though no alarms had been triggered, there were a handful of non-emergency errors, enough to prompt a worried expression on Lowe’s face.

“Captain, we’ve got a problem.”

Already by her side, I started reading over the alerts.

“We’ve lost contact with the T-driss?” I half asked, half stated.

“I can’t realign the antennas, only four of six are even operational. We can’t contact mission control,” she said.

“I don’t understand,” Henderson began. “Didn’t Levi check this yesterday?”

“It’s just a minor power failure, isolated to the communications’ array. Probably a blown circuit,” Lowe explained.

“That’s the bang we heard?” I asked.

“Wouldn’t have been that loud. None of the alarms went off either, so no fire,” Lowe went on.

“What do you suggest?”  

“Not sure yet, we just have to find the damage.”

“I’m sure Levi was working on the solar array electrical supply yesterday. In his state of mind, he could have easily crossed some wires, since they run through the same sections as the Antennae,” Henderson suggested.

“I’ll get the repair logs,” I said. “Lowe, have a look at the wires in the meantime.”

Grabbing the repair logs, I started flipping through the handwritten pages, looking for the last entry. All of us had taken our turn maintaining the systems during our two-week tenure aboard the station, mostly one or two sentences to confirm that everything was in order. I didn’t even need to check the signature, seeing as I had become well acquainted with our team’s handwriting during our several years of training. Henderson’s, Lowe’s, Levi’s, my own—but an entry by a fifth, unknown person caught my eye, with loopy handwriting and an unintelligible signature. It was an entry by a person not stationed aboard the CSS.

But before I could examine the entry any further, a loud knock was heard, as if something had slammed against the station’s exterior.

The sound was loud enough to garner the attention of our entire team, but none could come up with a plausible explanation of what had caused it. Until the sound repeated, and Henderson had an idea.

“Lowe, you said two of the antennae were non-operational?”

She nodded.

“The way they were installed, it’s mostly clinging to the station by the cables running them. It’s possible the base detached, causing them to dangle around and periodically slam against the hull.”

We waited as the sound repeated, coming from approximately the same spot. Henderson could be right, and it meant fixing the problem would require a session of extravehicular activity.

“Don’t worry, I’ll go outside and fix it,” Henderson said, as if he could read our minds.  

“An unauthorized EVA session? Mission control won’t be happy,” Lowe chimed in.

“How are you planning to contact them to ask permission? Captain Foley is in charge. He can make the call,” Henderson replied as he gestured towards me.

I could only nod in agreement. “We don’t exactly have another choice.”

“Right… let’s get to it then,” Henderson said as he started heading for the airlock.

We accompanied him to the inner hatch with its preparation chamber equipped with spacesuits and tools. He quickly got dressed and entered the airlock, hesitating for but a moment to glance back at the three remaining suits.

“There’s only four suits in total,” he pointed out.

“There’s only four of us here,” Lowe said.

“Still, five bedchambers, even if the station isn’t manned to max capacity, there should be one suit per bed.”

“I can’t remember there being more than four,” I said. “Does it matter?”

“I’m not sure,” Henderson said, but he ultimately decided it wasn’t worth the time it took to discuss it. He closed the inner hatch to the airlock behind him and attached himself to the EVA safety-line. If he was right about the antenna, it wouldn’t be a hard task to reattach it to its base. He quickly climbed to the topside of the station and called in via radio to relay his findings.

“I see two broken antennae,” he said. “But they’re just broken and bent, not detached from the base.”

“Can you clarify?”

“I mean, the noises we heard, it couldn’t have come from the damaged antennae. It looks more like something tried to rip it out. There’s no impact damage.”

“Can you repair it?”

“Yeah, absolutely. Give me thirty minutes. Have Lowe look at the wiring in the meantime, there’s bound to be some damage to that as well.”

“I’m on it,” Lowe said, allowing me to stay on the line with Henderson.

“It’s weird, though. There’s nothing out here that could explain the damage nor the banging sound. It must be coming from inside,” Henderson said.

“Inside? How do you figure that?”

“Could be a fault with the pipes,” he said. “Or maybe someone moved into the walls.” He chuckled at the last quip, but I could tell he was nervous about the situation.

We tried to stick to small talk to ease the tension, but Henderson had to keep his mind focused, and I didn’t want to distract him from the task at hand with conspiracy theories. Still, my mind kept reverting back to the handwritten entry in the repair log, written by someone not present on the ship, though clearly dated more than a week after we arrived in space.

“Captain, I know you’re thinking about the repair log. I could tell you noticed the aberrant entry. I saw it too. I wanted to say something earlier, but I wasn’t sure what to make of it.”

“Did you recognize the signature?” I asked.

“No, but it made me think—” Henderson began, only to stop dead in his tracks.

“Henderson?”

He remained silent until I repeated his name over the radio.

“I think I see something,” he explained. “Yeah, there’s definitely something outside. It’s moving.”

“What do you see?” I asked, not yet understanding the gravity of the situation.

“It’s just like a weird silhouette. It’s hard to say, it’s too far away. It’s definitely moving though—Shit, it’s getting closer. Jesus Christ—it’s alive! Get me out—”

“Henderson?” I near yelled into the radio. “Henderson, respond!”

Another few seconds of radio silence, but Henderson wouldn’t respond. I kept calling for him, loud enough to catch the attention of the remaining crew. Lowe came rushing back to my position, startled by the ruckus.

“What’s going on?” she asked as she saw me gripping the radio with all my might.

“Henderson, he saw something outside. I think he—” I tried to explain before Lowe cut me off.

“Henderson? Who the hell is Henderson?”

“Wha—what?” I stuttered, confused.

“Why are you roaming around the airlock anyway, there’s no EVA planned for the day. We need to keep focused and fix the damned circuit so we can reestablish communication with mission control.”

“You were just here fifteen minutes ago. You saw Henderson exit the station,” I desperately tried to explain.

“Listen, Captain. I know it’s been a hard couple of days, but every crew member onboard Caelus is still inside. Levi is resting, and we’re here.”

“There were four of us,” I went on.

“I think I would have noticed a fourth member,” she argued, unreceptive to my information. “But if you’re starting to act like Levi, I’m going to have to lock you inside your bedchamber, too.”

“No, no, no. Look at this,” I said as I handed her the repair logs. “There are entries by five different people.”

“But you just said there were four of us.”

“Yes, and Levi remembers a fifth. Something is obviously wrong here, and I know it has something to do with whatever Henderson saw outside.”

As if interrupted by divine intervention, another loud knock reverberated throughout the station as if to support my theory.  

“Whatever is outside is knocking on the outer hull. It knows we’re in here.”

Lowe stared at the ceiling, then at the logbook, inspecting the different entries. Though she wasn’t entirely convinced there had ever been more than the three of us aboard the station, she was wise enough to understand that something wasn’t right.

“So, what do we do?” she asked.

“Henderson might still be alive. I need to go outside and—”

“No, you’re not setting a single, fucking foot outside. If you’re right, if Henderson even existed, whatever took or killed him is just waiting for a chance to get inside. We need to repair the busted circuit and contact mission control, and I can’t do that alone. I need you to reboot the system as I check the wires.”

I could only nod in agreement. As much as I worried about our colleague—it was the only correct course of action. We were in way over our heads and would need the support of mission control.

“Do you know where the damage is?” I asked.

“All the way in the back. Which means we’re going to have to stay in touch via radio.”

“I’ll call you from the bridge, then.”

We split up at the mid-section. I headed to the front, she to the back. At the bridge, I checked through the error messages again, which were all as unspecific as they were unhelpful. But a reboot was still in order, sometimes turning a system off and on was the proper course of action, even onboard a state-of-the-art space station.

“Lowe, are you at the site of damage?” I asked over the radio.

“Yes, I just arrived. But I realized something. There are five beds.”

“Yeah, there always have been,” I responded, recalling how Henderson had already pointed out that same fact earlier.

“You don’t understand, they’ve all been used recently. It doesn’t add up. Do you think Levi…” she trailed off.  

“I’m still not entirely sure what to believe, but I don’t think he’s crazy. We’ll discuss it as soon as the repairs are done. Get it done,” I said.

For the next twenty minutes, I worked on troubleshooting the system, checking for specific errors as Lowe fixed the wiring and broken circuits. Things were going smoothly until we were interrupted by three consecutive knocks, coming from Lowe’s side of the station.

“Did you hear that?” she asked.

“It sounded like it came from your end.”

“Yeah, I think I see movement through the window. I’m going to check it out.”

“Lowe, wait, stay on task.”

“Don’t worry, I’m not going outside; I’m just going to have a peek through the window.”

She went silent for a few moments, before calling, startled by whatever she was looking at.

“There’s something outside. I don’t even know how to…” her voice faded.  

“What do you see?”

“It’s completely charred, doesn’t have a face. It’s like a—wait, I think it saw me. No, no—this can’t be possible—”

“Lowe?” I called, but she was already gone.  

I let the system reboot on its own and rushed for the rear of the station. She’d been in the middle of the final repairs as the thuds were heard, but she had seemingly just vanished from existence.

“Lowe, please, answer me!” I yelled, but there was no one left who could listen. I searched every inch of the station to no avail, eventually finishing at Levi’s locked bedchamber. He was still inside, seemingly oblivious to the horrors going on around him, but the panicked look on my face told him all he needed to know. What he had warned us about for the past twenty-four hours had come to pass, but it brought him no sense of satisfaction.

“It happened again, didn’t it?” he asked.

“Lowe is gone,” I let out in a pathetic whimper.

“I’m sorry. I can’t even remember who they were. But I call feel the pain of their absence.” 

I tried to think back, but my memory had turned hazy. Though I could remember Lowe vanishing mere minutes ago, I could only distantly remember the man who vanished during his EVA session. I couldn’t even recall his name without straining my mind.

“If you get distracted for even a second, you’ll forget them.”

“What about—” I paused to think, unable to readily recall the loss he’d told us about. “What about Carey?”

“I feel her slip from my mind as soon as I let myself get distracted. But I won’t forget her. I can’t…” he whimpered. “That thing outside, it’s not going to give up. It’s going to get us all.”

“What is it—the thing?” I asked.

“I don’t know. But I think that once you’ve seen it—it’s already too late.”

I thought back to Lowe, how she had described the creature moments before she was taken. And how… Henderson… had seen it during his EVA.

“We need to inform mission control. We can’t let this thing win,” I explained.

Levi seemed uninterested in beating the entity clinging to our station, but I wasn’t yet ready to give up. I rushed to the damaged section, knowing that Lowe had been moments away from finishing up her repairs. What remained was a quick fix, and no sooner had it been completed, than another three knocks reverberated through the station. I tried my best to ignore it, not daring to check outside the windows. It didn’t matter, we ha reestablished contact with Earth, with our home.

Then, I noticed Levi heading for the airlock. Before I could even register what, he was about to do, he locked himself inside without donning an EVA-suit.

“Levi, what are you doing?” I asked as I pulled myself towards the inner hatch.

“I’m finishing things on my own terms.”

“No, don’t do this. Come on, please.”

“It’s only a matter of time before it gets us, too.”

“We’ll be fine if we just stay inside. We don’t have to give up.”

“It doesn’t matter what we do. I can already hear it talking to us. It’s learning from its victims. The more it takes, the more human it becomes. I can hear it whisper, using a voice I love. I want to go out while I can still tell the difference.”

“Levi, Please.”

But he had no intention of listening, and opened the outer hatch without a suit, nor being attached to a tether. He was pulled out into the darkness of space, his body left to float until he inevitably got pulled in by Earth’s atmosphere, where he’d effectively be cremated. To him, that was a kinder fate that meeting whatever creature waited outside.

Letting the shock wash over me for no more than ten seconds, I rushed to the bridge, where I could finally establish contact with mission control.

“This is Captain Foley reporting. We have had an incident onboard the CSS. There have been multiple casualties. Please advise.”

A reply dug itself through the static, a worried sounding man who had clearly not expected to hear from me.

“What do you mean ‘casualties’ how many? What happened?” the voice called from the other end.

“I’m not sure, at least—three—maybe four,” I responded as honestly as I could.

“Wait—four?” the voice asked. “Are you alone?”

“Yes.”

“Are you secure? What happened up there?” the voice asked, pressing for as much information as possible.

“It’s Fermi Event,” I said. “I’m not exactly sure what we’re dealing with.”

“A Fermi Event?” he asked. “Are you certain?”

“I think so, yes. What course of action do you recommend?”

The line went silent for a moment. When the man began to talk again, the concern in his voice had been replaced by hostile suspicion.

“I’m going to need you to answer a few questions, beginning with your full name, rank, and date of birth.”

They were trying to determine if I was who I said I was. While it was standard protocol in the case of a Fermi Event, it didn’t comfort me.

“My name is Brandon Foley. I am the captain on board the Caelus Space Station. I was born on—” I explained before getting cut off by the all too familiar knocks, cutting me off.

“Captain Foley, please continue.”

“Hold on…” I ordered, because with the knocks there had come a second sound, a voice calling through the airlock radio, one that was very familiar.

“Captain, I need you,” the voice said, calmly.

“Captain Foley, what was that sound?”

“I think there’s someone still outside,” I explained, my mind feeling hazy, the memories of my fallen crewmember fading from memory.

“Captain, you do not answer that call. No one is to be let into the station,” the radio operator ordered.

“Please, let me in,” the voice continued still calm.

“Captain, this is an order, stay on the line.”

But no sooner had I heard the voice, the voice of Carey Linden, did I feel compelled to open the hatch and let her in. After all, she’d only been outside on a routine repair task, and she was the only other person onboard Caelus. We’d trained alone, journey into space alone, and now we were the sole two people responsible for ensuring the mission didn’t fail. The radio operator in the background kept yelling orders at me, but his voice was distant and unimportant. Carey was all that mattered.

“Captain, can you hear me? It’s cold out here,” Carey said.

I headed for the airlock, but she was nowhere in sight, still her voice was emerging from the intercom.

“I can’t see you,” I said.

“Just open the outer hatch. I’ll be right there.”

The voice emerging from the radio at the bridge was barely intelligible. I could only just make out a few names he kept calling for—Henderson, Lowe, Levi—all people I’d never met. I only had one partner, and she would have been trapped in the vacuum of space if not for me. Not needing her to ask again, I pulled the lever to open the outer hatch. I wouldn’t have to be alone [anymore.](https://www.facebook.com/richard.saxon.author/)",322,0.99,6,RichardSaxon,2024-11-11 11:39:31,1goy0xn,328,High
NoSleep,The Horror Experience,"This will be the first time I have ever told anyone this. Even now, speaking about it, it was one of the most terrifying situations I have ever been in. To this day, I tend not to look out my window in the dark. It was October time last year and I needed to catch a break, so I did what any normal person would do and looked up social media for a getaway break. I've been single for 2 years now, and I usually do these things by myself. I find it a good way to get away from everything.

I came across a blog about a ''wilderness experience''. You would stay in a cabin out in the woods with one gigantic window that looks out at the wilderness. The cabin isn't much of a cabin at all. It is quite small, basically just one room, one gigantic window, a bed facing the window, and a small bathroom. So, I booked it that very weekend. The drive was uneventful; it took 2 hours to get there. When I was booking, I was told I was going to meet a man named Tom. Tom owned the cabin and, I presume, the land that it was on. I drove into a laneway. The lane went on for about 5 minutes of windy roads, gritted gravel, and shrubs on each side. The further I went in, the denser the shrubbery and trees became.

I pulled up in front of a big, square, white house. As I got out of the car, the gravel underneath sank me just a little bit by my own weight. I walked up to the door and rang the doorbell, then took two steps back. The door opened immediately. An old man greeted me at the door. He was around 5'6"", bald, in his 60s or 70s, wearing blue jeans.

""Hello there."" ""Hi, um, I have a booking in the getaway cabin."" ""Yes, yes, come in. We were expecting you.""

I walked up the two steps and into the house. The house was pretty regular, except for the gigantic ceilings above. There was a small desk to the right-hand side, where the old man went behind.

""Okay, so what time would you like breakfast at?"" said Tom

""Um, anytime really. I'm not in any rush.""

""Okay, we'll say 9:30.""

""Yeah, that's great.""

""And what experience are you looking for?"" asked Tom.

""Um, how do you mean?"" I replied puzzled by the question.

""Well, we have seasonal experiences around here, and because it's coming up to October, we have horror, or you can jump ahead and go straight to Christmas. The experiences are up to you. Here, here is the list.""

The list was an A4 sheet of paper. It had an option for four items: number one, Christmas, and then just beside it, in brackets, it said Santa Claus; number two was horror, and beside it, in brackets, it said Halloween; number three was New Year's; number four was Thanksgiving.

""Um, which one is the best?"" I asked the man, still confused by the offer.

""Well, while you're here, you will still get the whole experience of the wilderness, but what happens tonight will be completely up to you. Personally, I do think you should avoid the Christmas one, as we are still in October. But, are you brave enough to pick horror?""

I did want to get away from everything for a while. I didn't think I was going to be getting such a confusing offer. So, I looked at the man, took a brave breath in, and said, ""Sure, nothing scares me. Go on, I'll do the horror.""

""Excellent choice. So here are your keys. Your cabin is just out the door here, down the path through the woods, and you will see it in the middle of the field. Go there, and there are a number of items in the room. Beside these items will be a little note on how to use them. I recommend you keep the lights off; otherwise, when it gets dark out, you won't be able to see anything out your window. But if you keep the lights off, your eyes will adjust. So please, just remember that.""

I thanked the old man. I took the keys and went back to my car to collect my things. I followed the man's instructions towards the cabin. It was around 4:00 p.m. at the time. It was slowly getting to dusk as I arrived at the small cabin. The cabin was no larger than 8 ft tall. It was a brown square wooden box with one gigantic window overlooking the tree lines. I walked up to the cabin, unlocked the door, and let myself in. When I came in, there was one chair facing the window, a small fridge to my left-hand side, my bed to my right (not facing the window), and a small bathroom barely big enough for one person. There were a number of random items in the room.

The first one I noticed was a pair of binoculars. The binoculars had a note beside them that said, ""Use me at nighttime. I am night vision."" The next items I noticed were earplugs. The note beside the earplugs said, ""Use me if the wind gets too loud."" Finally, there was a notebook. The note beside it said, ""Write down your experiences here.""

After settling myself in, I decided to take a seat on the chair, pulled over the binoculars, and put them on to see what was in the wilderness. It was around 5:00 p.m. at this point. Off in the distance was an apple tree. Four small baby deer came out and slowly moved their way over to the apple tree, picking at it. The two main deer walked behind the baby deer. It was quite an unbelievable sight, one that, if I wasn’t in this cabin and I was standing outside, would surely never happen because the deer would have been too afraid once they saw me. But behind this window, I could see everything in the wilderness.

At 7:00 p.m., it was pitch black. At this point, I had all the lights off, staring out into the shadows. The night vision binoculars were working. You could see everything in a dark green palette. As I was there gazing out into the wild, I heard a knock on my door. I got up out of my chair and opened it, and not to my surprise, there was no one there. I figured this was one of the horror experiences. It did give me butterflies in my stomach—excited ones—so I sat back down with a small grin on my face.

Suddenly, as I looked out the window, something just ran by. I could barely make it out, but it was definitely in the figure of a human. I picked up my night vision goggles to have a look. Searching far and wide, I found nothing. It must have been just my eyes adjusting, or again, just another one of these horror experiences.

For the next 2 hours, nothing really happened. I drank two beers as I sat in the chair, opened a bag of chips, and just listened to the wind. I wrote down some of my experiences. I wrote down noticing the deer, someone knocking on the door, and something running by the window. I read back on a few of the entries. Nothing out of the ordinary except one from four weeks ago. It was from a woman named Mary. She said that she also had knocks on her door and saw something or someone running by. She said that she regretted picking the horror option.

I told myself I should get ready for bed, but not before I had another look outside using the night vision binoculars. Again, I searched wide and far. Then I noticed something way off in the tree line. Two small dots lit up. The more I stared at the two dots, the more an outline of a figure emerged. It looked like a really skinny man. The man had really long hair coming down his face. Out from the two dots, which I presumed were his eyes, he was hunched over with his shoulders out in front, but his arms were long and skinny. I stared at him for nearly a minute, wondering why there was a man out in the woods at this time. This was surely another horror experience happening.

I stood up from my chair, still in complete darkness. I lowered my binoculars, trying to see if my naked eyes could see the man, and to no surprise, I couldn’t, as it was way too dark outside. So, I put the binoculars back up to my eyes. That’s when I noticed the man was now standing outside of the tree line, closer to me. The tree line was about 100 meters away from the cabin. All in front of me was overgrown grass blowing in the wind. The hunched man never moved, his shoulders still pointing towards me, with his arms nearly down as far as his knees. His hair was still slicked down his face. My heart began to speed up. What was actually happening here? Is this part of the horror experience that the old man welcomed?

Again, lowering my binoculars, I decided to take a sip of water and then put the binoculars back up to my eyes. Now...The figure was about 50 meters away. He was a lot taller than I first expected. I don't know how he got this close so quickly. I took a sip of water for only 3 seconds. How could he move that fast? Since he was closer, I noticed he was breathing heavily. I noticed his arms and body were full of scabs. His facial features became clearer the closer he got, and yet he still didn't move. As I stared, I could see his eyes were staring directly at me.

I decided to grab my phone and call Tom. I was worried that this wasn't all part of the experience. I searched for Tom's name on my phone, found it, put the phone to my ear, and looked up. The man, or figure, was now only 10 feet away from the window. At this point, I did not need binoculars at all. The figure was taller than the cabin itself. Its eyes were fixated on me. Its hair was no longer covering its face. Its wide mouth was left hanging open. Its long arms moved up and down as its body was breathing.

I kept my eyes on the figure as Tom wasn't answering his phone. The figure's head shifted upwards, looking into the sky. Its neck was long and skinny. Its hair was falling down the back of its head, revealing its skinny, stretched abdomen. It roared in a high-pitched voice. I put my hands to my ears. The noise was unbearable. I grabbed the earplugs that were left in the cabin. I reached for the light switch to turn on the lights. The lights were blinding as they came on. I looked back out the giant window but could only see the reflection of myself. Then something banged against the window. Pushed up against the window was one of the baby deer I saw earlier. It was lifeless. Wrapped around its neck were five long, gray fingers.

The loud scream came back again. I pressed my hands against my ears yet again, keeping an eye on the window. The deer vanished as if thrown away from the glass. The screaming slowly deteriorated into silence. All there was, was silence: me and my reflection. I hesitantly went to go and turn off the light switch. I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and flicked the switch. Slowly opening them, I noticed nothing. There was nothing there, only the vast field and the tree line. I didn't get a wink of sleep that night.

The next morning, I went back to Tom's house to check out. I rang the doorbell to be greeted by Tom.

""Why, hello. Welcome."" Tom said in suprise. ""Um, I was just about to come down with your breakfast.""

""Yeah, that's quite all right. I honestly didn't get a wink of sleep last night, and I need to go home. But thank you so much. I'm going to hit the road as soon as I can.""

""That's no problem at all. Come on in and I'll check you out."" Tom said in a welcoming manner

I stepped back into the high-ceilinged hallway. I handed over the keys to Tom as he took out the card machine for me to pay.

""So you must have had a hell of an experience last night, then?"" Tom smiled gleefully

""Yeah, you weren't kidding with the horror experience anyway."" I replied in a friendly laugh

""Oh, it's just a little bit of fun. It wasn't supposed to scare you that hard."" Tom said proudly

""Well, I just couldn't sleep, knowing there could be someone just standing outside my cabin the whole night."" I laughed back

Then Tom said it.

""Oh, I don't be standing out in the middle of the field all night. I just do a simple knock and run by, that's all."" Tom said non chnonchalantly

""Yeah, and the tall, skinny man who was off in the tree line?"" I said raising my brow still putting on a grin

""Excuse me? What tall, skinny man? We only have one experience here for horror, and that's me knocking on the door and running by. What man in a field are you talking about?"" Tom finished speaking, lower his voice with each word he said, staring at me....worried.

Then it hit me. If it wasn't him that was out in that field staring at me, then what was it?",109,0.96,5,GRIM_READER_YOUTUBE,2024-11-11 14:44:48,1gp2o4s,114,High
NoSleep,Not going on trips to the countryside ever again,"I was on a solo road trip, just a quick escape to clear my mind. It was late afternoon, and I was driving through a quiet part of the countryside—empty fields and dense trees on either side, with barely another car in sight. I’d been on the road for hours when I saw a motel that looked a bit run down but not too shabby, there were cars parked and a couple of people outside so I thought I might stay the night.  
  
I pulled in and parked near the front office. An older woman came out to greet me, her hair a soft gray, face kind but worn. “Looking for a place to stay?” she asked, she was nice and gentle, seemed really welcoming so I was really positive about the place.

“Yes, just for the night,” I said, already feeling relieved to be off the road.

She handed me an actual key, not a card, and offered a room in the main building, just next to her house. “I don’t usually get many guests this time of year,” she said with a small smile. “Would you like some dinner, too? It’s no trouble.”

I agreed, and she led me inside. The place was old but cozy in its own way, like someone had lived there forever. She made a simple stew, and we ate in her small dining room, filled with old books and faded pictures. She was kind, even chatty, talking about her family, the town, and how she’d run this place her whole life. I felt oddly comfortable, like I’d known her for years.

As we finished eating, she looked at the clock—it was close to 8 p.m.—and her face turned serious. “One last thing,” she said, her voice low. “After 8, don’t laugh please, it's our polcy here.""

I stared at her, waiting for her to laugh it off, but she didn’t. She kept her gaze steady. She told me not to disregard what she'd just told me, and that she was really serious about it. I forced a nervous smile, hoping it was some local superstition. “Why's that though?” I asked, but she didn’t answer. She just gave me a small, knowing nod and showed me to my room.

Back in my room, I tried to brush off her words, chalking it up to her quirky personality or maybe just a joke that went too far. Still, something about the way she said it stuck with me, making it hard to relax. I was scrolling through my phone to distract myself when I heard it—a faint laugh outside, drifting through the evening air.

I froze, heart pounding. It was faint, but there was something… odd about it. It didn’t sound like kids playing or even adults laughing naturally. It was off-pitch, hollow, as if someone was forcing themselves to laugh. I told myself it was just my imagination, just echoes in the trees, but then the laughter grew louder.

It moved around the building, slow and deliberate, until it was right outside my window. My skin prickled as I realized it sounded like… me. The same tone, the same cadence as if someone was mimicking my laugh but getting it just slightly wrong.

Then, I heard a single knock at the window, slow and deliberate. I felt every muscle in my body tense, too afraid to even breathe. Another knock followed, and then another, louder this time, as if something was pressing itself against the glass. I wanted to peek, to see if anyone was there, but a deep instinct kept me frozen, every nerve screaming *don’t look*.

The laughter continued, louder and closer, different voices joining in, each one sounding like a warped version of my own. I clamped my hand over my mouth, heart racing as I tried not to make a sound. I didn’t know why, but I felt certain that if I laughed, something terrible would happen.

Hours dragged by. At some point, the knocking stopped, and the laughter faded into silence. I must have dozed off in a state of exhausted fear, because when I opened my eyes, it was morning.

I stumbled out of the room, desperate to leave. The old woman was waiting for me at the front desk, looking calm, almost relieved.

“Did you laugh?” she asked, her voice soft.

I shook my head, still too shaken to speak. She nodded, a faint smile on her face. “Good. Some people… don’t listen.”

I didn’t ask anything else, didn’t want to know. I just thanked her and left as quickly as I could, trying to shake off the eerie feeling that followed me out of the driveway.

For days after I got home, I couldn’t bring myself to laugh. Every time I felt a laugh coming, I’d remember the hollow sound of that laughter outside my window, circling, waiting. Living alone, it was easy to stay silent, to keep myself from laughing—just in case something was still listening.",0,0.5,0,whipperowl,2024-11-12 15:41:36,1gpwcct,0,Low
NoSleep,What lies beneath ,"When my husband burst into our bedroom waving the transfer papers, his eyes sparkled with a joy I hadn't seen since our wedding day. 
“Germany, Sarah! They picked me to lead the Munich project!"" 

Staring at him in disbelief, our three-month-old daughter sleeping soundly in her bassinet beside us.
I should have been elated. This was his dream – leading an architectural team on an international project. 

But as I held our daughter Emma during those sleepless nights, anxiety gnawed at me, him being at the office or on business trips, Moving across the world with postpartum depression and a newborn felt like jumping off a cliff blindfolded. Still, I painted on a smile. 

John deserved this chance, even if lately it seemed his blueprints got more attention than his family.
""Think of it as an adventure,"" he whispered as our plane lifted off the tarmac. ""Just one year. We'll explore Europe together, make memories with Emma."" I squeezed his hand, leaving behind our family and friends. Not to mention everything we’ve ever known and loved 

The rental agent, Frau Weber, toured us through our new home in suburban Munich. The main floor was bright and airy, with tall windows that flooded the rooms with light. ""Perfect for a young family,"" she beamed. ""Excellent schools nearby, parks within walking distance.""
John practically bounced through each room, rattling off renovation ideas and pointing out architectural details. The basement, however, stopped his enthusiasm cold. While most of it had been converted into a modern living space, complete with plush carpet and delicate floral wallpaper, an odd door stood at the far end like a tomb marker. Its wood was scarred and weathered, children's stickers peeling off its panels, hinges orange with rust.
""What's behind there?"" I asked, noting how the door seemed to absorb the light around it.
Frau Weber's smile faltered. ""I... I'm not certain. The previous owner left rather suddenly, as he was a bit of a loner.I can inquire if you'd like?""
""No need,"" I said quickly, though something about that door tugged at the edges of my mind. ""We won't be here long enough to worry about it.""
The first few months passed in a blur of adjustment. John threw himself into his project while I navigated life as an attentive mother. Gradually, I made friends with other families in the neighborhood, as well as the moms who stayed at home. Though my German improved, I was still slightly nervous.Emma started sleeping through the night. Even John began coming home earlier, spending weekends taking us to beer gardens and on family outings instead of the office.

But that door. It haunted my thoughts, especially at night. I searched the shed, combed through boxes left by the lonely man, looking for a key. Nothing. Until our final week, as we packed to return home.
I found it in Emma's room, of all places, tucked inside an old stuffed bear that had been left on a shelf. The key was black iron, its head ornately carved with what looked to be some sort of moth 

""John!"" I called, racing to the basement. He followed in suit, curiosity overtaking his usual caution. The key slid in smoothly, as if it had been waiting for us. God knows how long it’s been waiting for us.

The stench hit first – sweet rot and old copper as if a million rats were left to die, the smell dissipating but lingering.John fumbled for the dangling light bulb. In the sickly yellow glow which mixed with the fluorescents that filled the basement, horror befell our very eyes.

Mason jars lined old shelves, their contents floating in murky fluid – eyes, tongues, fingers. Leather items that couldn't possibly be leather hung from hooks. Photographs covered one wall, showing people in various stages of terror. And there, mixed among the older pictures, were new ones.

Us. 

Walking Emma in the park. Shopping at the market. Sleeping in our bed.

On a workbench lay fresh tools and an appointment book. The last entry was tomorrow's date, with three names:

John. Sarah. Emma.

Frau stood in the doorway, her eyes blazing with rage and pure evil. ""I see you found our key,"" she spat, clutching a tarnished silver cross. ""I told my father that the teddy bear was a bad idea, but he never listened, just like he never did. He wanted me to carry out his twisted legacy long after he's gone, but I refused. That was until I realized he was right. A father who's inattentive, a mother whose mind is plagued with such great despair that it's more important than her child. And then there's little Emma, born out of wedlock. You're our perfect specimens, the whole reason he did this. He used his faith as a weapon, a justification for his monstrous acts. And now, so will I."" 

Letting out an agonizing scream, Frau lunged at my husband, the tarnished cross clutched in her hand. Tackling him to the ground, she raised her arms, screaming Proverbs and Psalms in his face. I grabbed the first thing I could find and smashed her in the back of the head. Blood began pooling from her long black hair as she fell to the floor, her twisted prayers broken. Mallet in hand, tears poured from my eyes. I had just killed someone, yet relief washed over me that this was finally over.

The police came and conducted a thorough investigation. They determined that Frau and her father were responsible for dozens of deaths, if not more. Not only previous residents but prostitutes and various homeless community members had fallen victim to them. Multiple cold cases were closed and the families were finally able to find some closure, even if they'd never be able to find the bodies.

We moved back to the States the next day. John took a pay cut to transfer home early. Sometimes I see him checking the locks twice, three times at night.And Emma's new room? We sealed off the closet door completely.

But late at night, I swear I can hear hinges creaking somewhere in our house. And sometimes, when I check on Emma, I spot a strange sticker on her wall that wasn't there before.

NoSleep,Out of Sight (Part 1),"My therapist told me that writing about things could help. She kind of looked away when she said it, so I’m not sure she believes that. If I’m honest, I think she just doesn’t want to talk about it anymore. It doesn’t matter though. I’m gonna write about it anyway. I’m gonna write about it because it DID happen, and it doesn’t matter what she thinks. At least if I post it here, someone might actually read it. If I post it here, maybe it can help.

I should probably start with the move.

My dad had taken a job outside of Cleveland. It was a spur of the moment thing. He didn’t really have a choice, given the circumstances. He accepted his first job offer, looked at one house, and drove a U-HAUL straight to Peninsula.

My dad is a suburban nature-lover. He’s the kind of guy who hikes trails on the weekend in clean boots and cargo shorts. To be fair, his cargo shorts are kind of legendary though. Some of his pockets literally have smaller pockets inside. At the time I thought he just needed a place to put all the crap he bought. I figured that he collected gear, which collected dust, and that was just the capitalist lifecycle.

Anyway, what I’m trying to say is, it wasn’t entirely a coincidence we ended up living in Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The hiring manager at Whalen and Erie Railroad had given us a generous relocation stipend. So when someone tipped off my dad to a “gem of a property in the park,” he jumped on it.

The gem, as it turned out, was overhyped. Aside from the incredible great room, which kind of looked like a glass cathedral standing over the valley, the house was a dump. The septic tank was a rust-caked hole, and the well water looked like it was pumped from a muddy tire-track.

Ironically, the dilapidated state of the house probably sealed the deal. The owner was an old widow with no family. When she showed us the house, she turned the knob on the kitchen faucet, and it sputtered brown bubbles. She let out this pathetic, nervous laugh and said something like “Robert always did all that stuff,” then stifled a sob and apologized. I think my dad was about ready to cry too, and he made a cash offer the same day.

We quickly settled into our new home. Living in the heart of the park, it felt silly to drive to the trailhead when I could just step out of my house directly into the woods. So I started blazing my own trails. It was that time of year when you can lose yourself in the rhythmic shuffling of leaves underfoot. It’s an amazing time to visit Northeastern Ohio, if you stick to the trails. 

I would spend hours everyday wandering the woods. I didn’t want to go to school, and my dad didn’t have the heart to make me. So we reached an agreement: I could pursue a GED from home as long as I remained open and honest about how I was feeling. I would never hurt myself, but given our family history, I didn’t blame him for worrying.

So while he was at work, I walked. The main valley is majestic, but I’m fond of the untouched places. There are lots of little feeder valleys, these soil-rich places where the roots haven’t stopped the erosion. I bought a guidebook on the park, and I used it to pick out different kinds of trees while I walked through the valleys: American Beech, Sugar Maple, Norway Maple, Red Maple, Red Oak, Pin Oak, White Oak. I got pretty good at identifying them. My favorite was Musclewood, which kind of looks like a wizard turned a jacked horse into a tree.

If you take the time to look at the trees in a forest, one thing you’ll notice is that they carve out little fiefdoms. If you see an oak, it’s probably surrounded by oaks. Sometimes, like with Quaking Aspen, it’s because a single tree sprouts so many trunks that the whole freaking forest is just one tree, but usually it’s just good old competition. Black Walnut, for example, likes to poison the soil around it with juglone.

I was walking along the valley floor when I noticed them. At the head of this small valley were six beech trees. Each of them was nearly identical in height and circumference. As I got closer, it was clear that they were spread out to form a perfect hexagon. I stopped dead in my tracks. Surrounded by perfect wilderness, these six gray trees stood in their nice configuration like concrete monuments.

Someone had planted them. For a second, I wondered if maybe, just over the ridge, there was a park bench with a little plaque commemorating a loved one. Far from comforting me, the thought triggered a fear that I was not alone. Was someone else standing out of sight? Lurking? Watching me? I turned a slow circle, looking in every direction.

There was no one. Of course there was no one. The nearest trail was at least a half-mile away. Uneasiness slowly overtook me with that realization. If no one comes out here, then who planted the trees? I turned back to face them. Inspecting them a second time, I could see there was something carved into the trunks. 

It wasn’t any language I could read, at least not at that distance. The symbols ran in thin interweaving bands that wrapped each trunk at the same height. I wanted a better look, and my curiosity compelled me. I started to walk toward the closest tree, but the sound of my first step startled me. 

The forest was perfectly silent.

I don’t mean quiet. It didn’t get quiet. It was *silent*. No squirrels. No birds. No wind. It was silent. 

Tinnitus rang like an alarm in my ear. The word “PREDATOR” pressed at the back of my mind like a hot iron, and I froze. Every muscle tensed with the effort of not moving. Not an inch. Not a millimeter. Motion was sound, and sound was death.

With shallow breaths, I slowly craned my head five degrees to the left, then five degrees to the right. I strained my eyes to the edge of their sockets trying to see as much as I could. No signs of movement. I looked a second time, turning my head a little more. Nothing. On my third scan, I saw it. There, in the middle of the hexagon, was a seventh tree.

I was confused at first. It seemed to blip into my peripheral vision as I turned my head away. I turned back, and it was gone. I pushed my glasses up the bridge of my nose. Surely it was a trick of the light. But again, when I turned my head slowly, the tree appeared at the very edge of my vision.

The seventh tree stood perfectly centered between the others. I held it there, at the corner of my eye. I willed my vision to clarify, to show me something of the tree. It did not. I couldn’t make out any details, but I could tell from the dark colors that, unlike the other trees, this one was scarred top to bottom with illegible symbols.

As I stood there frozen, half-seeing a tree that doesn’t exist, the symbols started to glow. In an instant, I felt an intense heat on the side of my face. My breaths were no longer shallow by choice; they were squeezed from me by an electric tension in my chest. Just before full panic set in, a twig snapped.

The forest erupted with the sound of my flight. My shoes kicked leaves, gouged soil, and sent rocks tumbling into the creek as I screamed each breath. This was life or death—a frantic, mindless sprint. As I tore around a bend in the valley floor, I dared to look over my shoulder. I needed to know.

I should have been looking ahead.

The back of my skull slammed into the ground. As I lay there, head swimming, a shadowy figure stepped into my blurred vision: “Womp womp womp?” 

It was talking, but I couldn’t understand anything over the “shhhhhh” of blood shooting through my veins. I felt the figure brush against my left leg as it moved to stand over me, and I sprang into action. Operating entirely on instinct, I shifted my weight, hooked my right leg behind its knee, and kicked its legs out from under it.

I didn’t bother to gauge my success. I scrambled to my feet, my head starting to clear, and ran home screaming through the woods, battered but alive.

My dad was standing on a ladder installing new gutters on the front of the house. As my dogged running slowed to a stop, I heard him shout: “Jesus Christ, Nathan. Are you okay?”

I was no longer screaming by this point. I had long since lost the energy. Instead of answering him, I steadied myself on the porch railing. I sank to a crouch, and vomited. 

“Holy shit. Nathan!?” 

My dad jumped from one of the lower rungs on the ladder and rushed to my side. He touched the back of my head, and I could see from his hand that I was bleeding. I swallowed, and said, “I hit my head.” I gasped a few breaths. “I fell.”

The knock came a few hours later. My dad was grabbing a new ice pack from the kitchen. On his way to answer the door, he stopped at the couch where I was laying. 

“How are you feeling buddy?”

“Like shit.”

“Attaboy.” 

My dad smiled and continued to the entryway. He opened the front door, and I could hear the conversation as it leaked into the living room:

“Good evening!”

“Hello.”

There was an awkward silence.

“My name’s Nevin.”

“Hello, Nevin.”

There was another silence, and Nevin cleared his throat.

“Uh. Well, I’m not sure I’m in the right place, but a young man ran into me this morning, and it looked like he might’ve gotten hurt. I asked around, and it sounds like he might be your son?”

“So that’s what happened.” I could hear my dad shuffle his feet, and I imagined he was looking over his shoulder in my general direction. “Well, I appreciate you checking in on him. He got a solid knock on the head, probably a little concussion, but I think he’ll be alright.”

The visitor drew in a hissing breath at the mention of my injury, but was audibly relieved to hear I was okay: “Oh, thank God. I was horrified when I saw blood on the ground. It looks like he hit his head on a rock.”

“Yeah, that’ll do it,” my dad sighed, “but I promise he’s doing good.” He paused. “Are you okay? He must’ve hit you pretty hard to go sprawling like that.”

“Oh, don’t worry about me. I’m totally fine.” The visitor’s tone was almost self-deprecating before he exclaimed “Ah!” and I heard what sounded like the rustling of a plastic grocery bag. “His phone. I think it fell out of his pocket when he ran into me.”

My dad chuckled. “Nathan would’ve missed this, that’s for sure. Thank you, Nevin. It’s nice to know that there are still some good Samaritans out there.”

“Gosh, I can’t imagine not checking in. I’m sure you would’ve done the same.”

A satisfied silence indicated that the expected niceties had been exchanged before my dad bade Nevin a goodnight.

“Welp, Nevin, I’m Jonathan Brooks.” I could hear the commotion of a handshake. “Thanks again for stopping by and bringing the phone back. If you ever need anything, you know where to find us.”

“Of course, Jonathan. Tell Nathan I wish him a speedy recovery. Goodnight.”

My dad closed the door and walked back into the living room, smiling and waving my phone back and forth in his hand. He tossed it onto my stomach. “So are you ready to tell me what the heck happened?”

I let out a groan. “To be honest, I’m not totally sure what happened, and now I kind of feel like a jackass.”

My dad sat down at the end of the couch and put his hand on my knee. “Honestly, I’m just glad you’re okay. You must’ve been scared out of your mind to run into somebody that hard.”

I let out a terse laugh. “Yeah. I was pretty freaked out. I was heading up toward the Brecksville reservation—you know where I mean? Well, I was just walking, and I thought I saw something weird out of the corner of my eye. LIke there was this tree, and—” I stopped. “Well, it sounds ridiculous now, but it really freaked me out, man. Anyway, I was on the verge of a panic attack when I heard something, and I just booked it.”

The smile faded from my dad’s face, and I knew I had inadvertently ruined the evening.

“Nathan—”

“Dad, it’s okay,” I interjected. “It wasn’t anything like that. It wasn’t a hallucination or anything. I just got a little spooked out there by myself, and I acted like an idiot. It’s fine.” Without meaning to, the volume of my voice had gotten louder with each word. 

He took in a deep breath and let it out as he patted my knee. “Okay, buddy. Okay. It’s okay.” He leaned over and gave me a light hug before standing up. “Just remember our promise. If you’re feeling weird or sad or anything’s wrong, you gotta—”

“I have to tell you,” I blurted out. Correcting my tone from irritation to understanding, I said “I know.”

“Good.” He stretched his hands overhead and yawned. “It’s been a wild day, bud. Get some sleep.”

As he creaked his way upstairs to bed, I picked up my phone to check for notifications. It was dead. I leaned over the armrest and grabbed my charger. As I was plugging it in, I noticed a slip of paper tucked into the phone cover. Absent-mindedly, I pulled it out and unfolded it.

Written with childlike penmanship were five words:

DID YOU SEE THE TREE

My hand shook, and the slip of paper fell from my grip. I slowly got off the couch and opened the front door. I stuck my head outside. The city maintenance depot stood across the street. Its steel fence looked yellow under the light of the fluorescent lamp post, but I saw nothing out of the ordinary. The street was empty; there was no traffic. The only sound was the chirping of a billion bugs. It was a normal fall night.

Relieved, I pulled my head back inside. As I turned to shut the door, out of the corner of my eye… a man appeared beneath the lamp post.

I slammed the door and let out a shocked breath. 

“Nathan! Are you okay?”

My dad thundered to the top of the stairs. I gathered myself.

“Sorry, dad. Yeah, I’m fine. I slipped when I was closing the door.”

“Jesus, what are you doing? You’re hurt buddy. Go lay down and get some sleep.”

“Yeah, yeah. You’re right. I’m sorry. I was just getting some fresh air.”

“Gah, jeez. Give me a heart attack,” he mumbled. “Well, cut that out now. It’s time for bed.”

We said goodnight, but I didn’t sleep. I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, at the edge of my vision, the symbols glowed like [neon signs](https://youtu.be/Fe4tRoHkLjw?si=QGiBKmZm7tb_j4mS).",19,0.93,2,No_Bathroom1296,2024-11-11 18:38:22,1gp83tv,21,High

After that night at Mirror Pool, everything changed.

 

I thought maybe the terror would fade, that Eli and I would laugh it off eventually, treat it like a bad horror movie experience. But whatever presence I’d disturbed at the lake seemed to have followed me back. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched—not just when I looked in mirrors or glass, but from everywhere. My own reflection seemed to haunt me, just at the edge of my vision.

 

At first, I saw her only faintly: a flicker in windows or darkened screens, a shape that disappeared if I looked too closely. Then it became more intense—moments where, just for an instant, I was sure I’d locked eyes with her. She was no longer just a figure I saw in passing. She felt real, and she was growing closer.

 

I called Eli, desperate for someone to talk to about this. He didn’t pick up, and I can’t say I blamed him. He’d sent me one voicemail after that night: “Whatever happened out there… I don’t wanna be a part of it, okay? I don’t know what you stirred up, but it’s not right. Just… don’t call me anymore.”

 

I was on my own.

 

Over the next few days, I found myself obsessively combing through Evelyn’s old journals, hoping for anything to explain what was happening to me. Most entries were her usual diary ramblings—notes on friendships, family drama, sketches of Mirror Pool and the forest. Then, buried in the middle, I found an entry that stopped me cold: *“The lake reflects more than just faces. It reflects what we hide, what we want, what we fear.”*

 

The words felt like a warning. Beneath the entry, she had drawn a pair of eyes, blank and staring, like they could see through the page. Somehow, they reminded me of the girl I’d seen in the reflection.

 

That night, I couldn’t stand to look at myself. I draped towels and sheets over every reflective surface in my room—the mirror, the glass of the window, even my phone screen. But it was useless. My dreams were full of Mirror Pool. I was back at the lake, standing alone on the shore. My reflection stared back at me, but it wasn’t me. It was her—smiling with a slow, eerie grin. Her lips moved as if whispering, but I couldn’t hear the words. She raised her hand and motioned for me to come closer. My feet felt rooted in place, my body numb and unresponsive as she drew me in with her empty, unblinking eyes.

 

I jolted awake, heart racing, drenched in sweat. For a moment, as my eyes adjusted, I could have sworn I saw her—the shape of my reflection standing at the end of my bed, watching me. But when I blinked, she was gone.

 

The next day, I knew I needed help. I couldn’t go to my family or friends. I’d sound insane. I remembered a poster I’d seen once at the local coffee shop for the Paranormal Society. It was a small group that met once a week in the back room, mostly for people interested in ghost stories and urban legends. I had to try.

 

That evening, I sat at the back table in the coffee shop, waiting nervously as a few people filed in. There were five in total—three older folks who seemed more interested in swapping stories, a young guy with headphones around his neck who seemed bored, and a woman in her thirties who took her seat quietly in the corner, her gaze thoughtful and observant. Her name was Mara.

 

As the others chatted, Mara looked over at me, her gaze sharp, like she could already see something different about me. Taking a deep breath, I told them my story—about Evelyn, Mirror Pool, and the reflection that didn’t seem to be my own. As I spoke, Mara’s eyes never left me. She listened without interrupting, not laughing or dismissing anything I said, even when I described seeing my reflection standing by my bed.

 

When I finished, Mara leaned forward, her voice low but intense. “You need to be careful,” she said, glancing around to make sure the others weren’t listening. “Mirror Pool… I’ve heard of it. It’s old—older than this town, older than any maps. People say it’s not just a lake. It’s a boundary.”

 

“A boundary?” I asked, my voice trembling.

 

“Between us and… well, things that shouldn’t be crossed over.” She spoke as if choosing her words carefully, like she was holding back. “When you look into Mirror Pool, you’re not just seeing your own reflection. You’re seeing something deeper. Some call it your ‘shadow self.’ Others say it’s a glimpse into your soul, or a version of yourself that lives beyond the surface. But if that reflection has found you, then it’s no longer just a vision. It’s reached into our world. And that’s… dangerous.”

 

Her words sent a chill through me, but there was something about the way she was looking at me that made me wonder. I felt she wasn’t telling me everything.

 

“So… what can I do?” I asked, my voice barely a whisper.

 

Mara hesitated, then leaned even closer. “There’s a ritual,” she said quietly. “It’s risky, but if done right, it’s meant to sever the connection between you and the reflection. You’ll have to go back to the lake… alone. And you’ll need to face her directly. No matter what she does, don’t speak back.”

 

I swallowed hard, the thought of going back to Mirror Pool making my stomach twist. “And if it doesn’t work?”

 

Mara didn’t answer right away. Instead, she looked at me with an expression I couldn’t read, her eyes dark and intense. “Let’s just say… make sure you know what you’re up against. Not every spirit wants to go back to where it came from.”

 

With Mara’s instructions, I prepared myself as best as I could. She’d given me a simple chant to repeat, a binding phrase she claimed would force the reflection back into the lake. She’d also told me that if anything felt *off*—if the reflection changed in any way or I felt a sense of dread—I should stop immediately and leave.

 

As dusk fell, I drove back to Mirror Pool, Mara’s instructions echoing in my mind. The woods were silent, and a heavy stillness hung in the air as I reached the lake. Mirror Pool looked darker than I remembered. The water was pitch black, like a void, its surface unusually calm and flat. I knelt at the water’s edge, whispering the chant Mara had taught me, watching my reflection take form in the dark water.

 

And there she was. My shadow self, staring back at me with eyes that seemed somehow sharper, more alive than before. She wasn’t smiling this time. Her face was set, angry, like I’d disturbed something she didn’t want interrupted.

 

I kept chanting, my voice steady as I forced myself to hold her gaze. Then, slowly, her hand rose from beneath the water, her fingers reaching toward me, breaking the surface with a ripple. My voice wavered as she stretched closer, her hand almost brushing mine.

 

Everything in me screamed to turn and run, but I forced myself to keep chanting, the words rolling off my tongue like a lifeline. Suddenly, a cold pressure gripped my wrist, and I felt a pull, like she was trying to drag me down. Panic surged, and my voice cracked. But I kept going, repeating Mara’s words, willing her to let go.

 

Finally, the grip loosened. The water stilled, her face fading back into the blackness. For a long, tense moment, I knelt there, breathing heavily, staring at the empty water.

 

It felt like it was over.

 

But when I got back to my car, I had the unsettling feeling that something was wrong. Mara’s last words echoed in my mind, the look in her eyes when she’d handed me the ritual instructions. She had seemed almost… satisfied. Like she’d known exactly what would happen.

 

It’s been a few days since that night, and while I haven’t seen the reflection again, there’s something… off. When I catch my reflection in mirrors now, it feels like it’s watching me with a strange intensity, almost like it’s *waiting*.

 

And sometimes, late at night, I feel eyes on me, a sensation too familiar to ignore. I can only hope it’s over—but a part of me can’t shake the feeling that Mara hasn’t told me everything.",8,0.72,5,Important-Victory-25,2024-11-11 23:04:16,1gpd8il,13,High
NoSleep,My child hasn't been sleeping.. [Part 2],"Hello again,

Finn slipped into a coma last night. The doctors didn’t see it coming, but I had a feeling it would. My wife won't leave the hospital and it seems that she will not eat anything. I needed to go back home, and I tried to take our baby girl with me. My wife wanted our daughter with her.

On my way out the local priest Father Milton, a 60-year-old man tried to enter Finn's room. I tried to get him to leave but my wife insisted. I watched for a moment while he prayed over my son.

I got back home and grabbed my bottle, not knowing what to do. I was scared, tired, and confused. The only thing I knew now was how to tip this bottle and try to forget. That's what I did. I sat staring at a black screen and started to think about my boy. I even thought about my brother. How they seem so connected, but the strings are invisible. The light taps of rain hitting the window were drowned out by my thoughts.

That's when a knock on my door echoed through my silent and empty house. The bang made me jump, knocking the bottle on the ground as the liquid sank into my carpet. I sprung up and picked the bottle up, capping it and sliding it under the couch. I wiped my eyes and opened the door.

There he stood in the rain off of our porch, as if he had jumped off at my answer. His black lightweight jacket took a pounding, and his hair was drenched underneath the hood. He looked up at me, his eyes sunken in their holes, black underneath.

""Anthony?""

I don't like to talk about Anthony, not to anyone it's just not my place. Because of all that he has been through it's best for the town to forget. Anthony was why I never looked back at religion, and why he is how he is today. He isn't the bright kid that would come over and play with Kevin, not anymore. He was now a child in a man's body, shaken by what happened to him, never to grow to recover. The town turned its back on him, an open secret, that many wanted to forget. Myself being one of them.

""Hi Doug.""

""Come on in here, get out of that rain.""

He shrugged and took a ginger step onto the porch. He was not a small man by any means, but he slouched always. He stood under the awning, looking into my eyes.

""What are you doing here?"" I asked.

""I... I am not crazy, Doug. I am just a little confused.""

""Anthony, I don't know if you have heard but it's not a good time-""

He cut me off.

""Finn slipped into a coma tonight didn't he?"" His eyes darted to the ground.

I couldn't even make a sound, everything got caught in my throat, and my mouth dropped.

""How did-

""I know because I saw him last night. In my apartment. Do you mind if we go somewhere?""

I didn't know what to do.

""Let me get some things.""

He stood under the awning, as I grabbed my wallet and walked out of the house.

""Anthony, where's your car?""

""I don't have one.""

Maintaining my sober act, I nodded and walked to mine.

We drove down the road. Both of our eyes looked at Anthony's old home as we passed by it, it was old and falling apart. He stared longer than I did. 

We decided to go to a bar. The Settler’s Den was pretty empty. I haven’t been here for years, but it seems like Anthony knew the place. We sat ourselves and slid into a small booth in the corner. It took a minute. I looked at Anthony's hands, they were shaking. I was hoping it was due to the rain and not other things. I ordered a beer, and Anthony ordered two rum and coke's at once. He downed one right away as he licked his lips, not a drop spilled, nor wasted. I sipped mine.

""You remember what happened back in the day?""

""Anthony I thought we were going to talk about last night. I mean, we don't need to bring up what happened to you.""

""I know, but you do right?""

I nodded. ""I am sorry about that.""

""I didn't.""

""What?""

""Listen to me when I say this Doug, and don’t judge me until after. But, I didn't remember. Not for the longest time.""

""What? You probably blocked it out. It was so traumatizing.""

""Yeah, that's what I have been told my whole life. That it wasn't my fault, that I wasn't to blame. But still for years to come everyone looked at me differently, even today. I see the way you look at me when we run into each other at the liquor store. That gnawing feeling, like I am a bad memory of this town that people want to forget, but when they see me this scar reopens. Yet, I don't know why.""

""Anthony...""

""Why Doug?""

I was completely fazed by his question I had to spit out the truth.

""Anthony you were abused by that priest.""

He just looked at the table.

""You were sick and he came in when you were at your lowest and he took advantage of you. You went up on the stand, you told everyone. He got caught because you were so brave.""

""Father McCleary."" He said softly. You know the last thing that I remember from that time? I walked out of my house that night, to pick up some toys, and I looked down the road the one leading to your house. I saw a person walking down it, walking right towards my home. It took a second but then I saw - it was Kevin. He was wet, each step with a squeak. He came up to me and said that he was sorry. I turned back to my house confused. My mom told me that Kevin was sick. I turned back and he was gone. That happened on the third of October, after that, I remembered nothing.""

I looked up at him. October 3rd was the night that Kevin died.

""Anthony, what do you not remember?""

""Doug, none of the time I was sick, nothing after that moment.""

Anthony told me it was all blacked out. He only remembered that when he got out of his illness. That was when he started to remember, a day after that his parents started acting weird. They started to get convinced something happened with that priest.

""I was scared. I mean my parents were telling me what happened to me, they were all that I had. They told me that I was molested, and taken advantage of by this man, and this was when my parents were religious. So I trusted them.""

""Anthony, why are you telling me all of this?""

""Because I went to my house the other day, before the first rainfall. It was like it was calling to me in my dreams. I walked over to it. You know no one has bought it since my issues it just stands there rotting away. The door was of course opened, so I just walked inside.""

""You broke in?""

""I walked up the stairs to my room. It took a lot, even though I couldn't remember why. It was like the house was pulling me towards it while pushing me away. Heavy steps got me there, and I stepped into it. Where so much took place, and none of it I knew. The air was dead, no wind even through broken windows. I just stood there, ultimately saddened by no gained memory. It was in the end just a room. My bed frame was still there, the mattress taken probably by some homeless man. I walked up to it.""

He took a quick sip of his other drink.

""For some odd reason, I wanted to touch it, and I did. Doug, I am not kidding to you, it was as fast as a flood, all the knowledge all of the memories, all the screaming and pain all compressed into my brain and melted into its halls. I fell onto the floor, as tears just shot out of my eyes already pooling onto my hands. After that night of seeing your brother, that was when I started to see the man in my room.""

I didn't interrupt. I just stared at Anthony telling me what happened to him.

""Back then I couldn't recognize him, he was tall and he was smiling. He stood all the way up and waited in the corner of my room. All night just staring at me. I couldn't move, I barely breathed. It was as if each breath was if I was drowning in the air. For several nights I saw him. But, now it's easy to know who it was Doug, it was me, literally me today staring at my younger self.""

I shuddered at the thought.

""I was completely bedridden after that. I couldn't talk to my parents, I couldn't control my movement. I was a passenger in my own body. I didn't know what took control, but I could hear them as if they were a million miles away but, still barely whispering in my ear. It was a sharp voice, maybe even a little high-pitched. It was a language I never heard. But, it was terrifying. That was when Father McCleary and Father Milton came to the house.""

""Father Milton the priest who is still at St. Innocent's?""

He nodded.

""Wait wait what are you saying?""

""It took a little bit of time. This was when I was floating away, I couldn't hold any control and whoever took it from me was pushing me towards the exit. I was floating into the darkness, no more whispering, no more seeing, all I could hear was one thing and it was growing louder and louder, it was the soft running of water. Maybe a ravine.""

He snapped at me.

""Just like that I woke up and I fell about 10 feet onto my bed. Both of the priests ran to me, throwing a blanket over me, trying to tend. Then a day or two later, my parents were telling me that I was you know that… that I was a victim.""

""Anthony are you saying-""

""I think that this thing plays with memories it makes people forget, or remember wrongly. It burrows its way into your brain and fog up where it left off, so no one knows. Because, my parents witnessed a miracle, but only perceived it as the worst act imaginable. It then made me forget completely until now.""

He was holding back tears.

""I testified against the man who saved my life, and he had to stand there and take it. He died in jail you know? Not so long after I put him in there. Stabbed in the stomach and chest eighteen times. The only person to try to defend him was Father Milton.""

Nothing came to mind what to say.

""I know why he was put there.""

""What do you mean Anthony?""

""I don’t know what it is but it made us all corroborate this story for a reason, it messed with all of us. Because I think it’s afraid that Father McCleary knew how to stop it now. Or he was probably going to try if I hadn’t done what I did.""

He wiped his eyes and took the last sip of his now watered-down drink.

""Anthony, this all came to you just like that?""

He nodded while looking back down.

""Anthony the same thing happened to me.""

He looked up at me now, his eyes widened.

I told him about Kevin's cape, and what happened when I grabbed it. How it all happened just like he told me.

""It happened to you too?"" He whispered.

“What is happening?” I had to ask, knowing he didn’t have an answer.

""I don’t know. But, now I have to tell you about what happened last night. After my awakening, I went down a bad road. I took every night to the bottle and cried. Cried all day and all night. It's not hard to drink at work, when I work nights so I did that as well. I was going through a handle within a day, a day and a half. Easily. I drank and drank trying to wipe the memories and make them as if they were fiction. But, I knew they weren't. I am in a very dark part of my life right now Doug.""

I could only just listen to him.

""Last night I got home from my shift. I poured myself a stiff drink, and I drank it in under 5 minutes. So, I made another, drank it, and then another. Within an hour or so I was starting to feel good. So, I went into my room all over the place and missed the switch, I fell down to the dark ground. Getting up and staggering all over the place I saw a shadow across my room. Completely dark, but my vision cleared for a second. I saw… your boy.""

I gripped the table.

""I saw Finn standing there in the room, right in front of my window. But, something was off he was trying to scream but only black gunk came out of his mouth. That's when I saw that he wasn't alone. Right behind him, was another boy. Whispering into his ear while holding his arms down. A smile that I hadn't seen in nearly 20 years. But, it was a dark grin, something malevolent. It was Kevin.""

I put my hand to my mouth.

""Then I heard a slushing sound and looked to the rest of my room, falling on dozens of eyes. There were 30 maybe 40 boys all standing there, all white skinned with black goo streaming from their mouths, eyes, and noses. Some were skin to bone, others were like they were inflated parts on their bodies, and most were missing parts of them. Jaws nearly ripped off, fingers missing, boys with no legs. Yet, they were all screaming with no noise. All staring at me, all begging for my help. That's when my ears shattered, all of those voices drowned out all that came to me. They all screamed HELP, but it was like they were all struggling to stay above water, they were all drowning. I ran out of my room, I just sat on the floor of my kitchen staring at the room. Shaking, hearing them cry for help that I can't give them.""

""Anthony...""

""I think that whatever it is it’s been here in Briggem for a long time. I think that this thing has almost claimed your son as its next victim.""

I swallow trying to hold back my tears.

""What the fuck can we do for Finn then? Is my boy going to die?""

Silence falls on the both of us. Then something hits me.

“There has to be something with that creek, in the woods. You know what I am saying?”

His eyes furrowed. 

“Why there?""

“That was the last place Finn went, and that was where I found Kevin’s cape. Something is leading back to there.”

“Really?” His face fell. ""That

Anthony put his hands together and leaned in.

""I think we first have to talk to someone that might have the slightest idea. Who knows if he even remembers but...""

I nod because I know exactly who he is talking about. Because, of how I treated him earlier, and now I will be asking for his help. But, if this is the only way of a shot that we have to bring our Finn back, then we have to take it.

""... we have to start with Father Milton.""

I could tell how nervous he was to face that man again, how much it was clawing at his mind. I just reached over and held his shaky hand. I knew it wasn't much comfort, but I hoped it helped.

With that all that needed to be said was done we stood up and walked out of the bar. We are going to St. Innocent’s together tomorrow morning. 

But, for the rest of the night, I drove back to the hospital and I waited there with my now-asleep wife, son, and daughter. I stayed up just staring at my boy. Thinking of all that he was going through, what was happening in his head, and hoping that he didn’t feel completely alone. For the first time in a long time, I had tried to pray.

Again I will update you all soon, please keep your thoughts for my family tonight. If anyone knows or has any idea what is happening please let me know.",36,0.92,2,Street_Camera_1258,2024-11-11 10:29:48,1gow9r9,38,High
NoSleep,My Neice Is Terrified By Something No One Can See. Now I've Seen It Too,"I was babysitting my niece one night while her parents went out for a well-deserved date night. They live in the basement of an old house, where the low ceilings and dim lighting give everything a heavy, shadowed look. At first, things were fine. She was laughing, pushing her toy car across the carpet, making little “vroom” sounds as it skidded along. I watched her, amused, letting her energy fill the quiet room. But then, mid-laugh, she froze. Her gaze drifted to an empty corner across the room, her mouth slowly opening as if she’d seen something terrible.

Then, without warning, she started screaming. The sound was raw, piercing, as if she were in pain. She scrambled into my lap, clawing at my shirt, her little fingers trembling. I held her tightly, feeling her heart pound against mine as she buried her face in my shoulder. Her cries echoed off the walls, and as I tried to calm her, I found myself glancing at the corner too—feeling a creeping sense of dread that had no reason to be there.

""Ellie, there's nothing there,"" I whispered, trying to keep my voice steady as I rocked her gently in my arms. She clung to me, her tiny fists clutching my shirt as her eyes stayed locked on the dark, empty corner. I looked over again, forcing myself to focus, trying to see what could possibly be frightening her so much. Shadows lingered there, but nothing more.

I kept speaking softly, and after a while, her grip loosened, her cries quieting to small hiccups as her gaze finally drifted back to me. I breathed a small sigh of relief and turned her away from that corner, cradling her head against my shoulder and talking about her favorite toys, anything to distract her.

But then, her little body tensed, and her gaze snapped back over my shoulder, to that same spot. This time, her scream was louder, more desperate—a sound that cut through me. She struggled in my arms, twisting to look at the corner as if something there was reaching out, pulling her in.

Her gaze was fixed on the exact same spot, unwavering, wide with terror. Against all my better judgment, I turned to look, my eyes following hers to the empty, shadowed corner. The basement light buzzed softly, casting faint shadows, but there was nothing—only the bare wall and darkened space where two edges met. Yet, as I stared, goosebumps prickled up my arms and across the back of my neck.

Ellie’s little fingers dug into me, clutching with surprising strength, her nails pressing almost painfully into my skin. Her whole body was tense, coiled with fear I couldn’t explain away. They say children are more sensitive to things we’ve long since blocked out—that they see what we can’t, that they’re open to things beyond understanding. The thought crept into my mind, gnawing at my sense of reason, and with it, a cold, uneasy fear took root. I couldn’t see anything, couldn’t hear or feel a thing, but the look on Ellie’s face told me she was seeing something that I couldn’t. Something that terrified her down to her core.

I decided it would be best to take her upstairs, so I grabbed a few of her toys and we left, heading upstairs to the living room.

The stairs creaked as we climbed, Ellie clinging to me, her head buried in my shoulder as if hiding from whatever had haunted that corner. I kept talking, my voice low and steady, hoping it would keep both of us calm. By the time we reached the living room, her grip had relaxed, and I was able to set her down gently on the couch.

I turned on the TV and put on Dora the Explorer, her favorite. Slowly, she seemed to forget about the basement, her eyes brightening as she started singing along with the familiar theme song. Relief washed over me as she began to play with her toys again, her laughter filling the room and pushing the eerie silence from my mind.

I headed into the kitchen, glancing back occasionally to make sure she was okay. Opening the cupboard, I grabbed a can of soup and popped it into the microwave. The soft hum of the microwave was oddly comforting, grounding me after the strange, tense moments in the basement. Just as the timer ticked down, I heard a faint, familiar sound—a quiet whimper from the living room. I turned around, and there was Ellie, standing frozen in front of the TV, her wide eyes staring back down the hall toward the basement door.

I rushed over, glancing down the hall into the empty darkness lingering at the top of the basement stairs. The shadows seemed thicker somehow, pressing against the doorway like a solid weight. For Ellie’s sake, I tried to stay calm, smiling as I knelt down and reassured her, even though my voice felt shaky.

“Let me just close the door, alright?” I said, my words more for my own reassurance than hers. I headed down the hall, each step making my pulse quicken. I kept telling myself it was nothing, that I was only spooked because of Ellie’s fear, but the closer I got, the heavier the air seemed to grow. I reached the door and swung it shut, feeling the weight of it as it clicked into place. I tested the latch, making sure it wouldn’t swing open.

Turning back, I forced a smile, hoping she couldn’t see the uncertainty in my eyes. “There’s nothing to worry about, Ellie. Uncle Mikey’s got you. You’re safe.” But even as I said it, a chill ran through me, the words feeling hollow. I could feel something lingering in the silence behind me, something I couldn’t see but somehow knew was there.

We settled into the routine, Dora the Explorer playing in the background as Ellie sipped her soup, seeming more like her usual self, her earlier terror fading with each spoonful. I relaxed a bit too, thinking maybe it had all been a child’s imagination running wild.

Then my phone buzzed, breaking the comfortable lull. It was a text from my sister, checking in, asking how things were going and if I wouldn’t mind switching the laundry over. I smiled, telling her we were fine, that Ellie was loving her Dora marathon and her SpaghettiOs.

After a moment, I texted back, asking where the washer and dryer were, hoping it was somewhere upstairs. Her reply came a moment later, casual as could be: In the basement, by the shower.

I sighed and replied, Sure, I’ll get it done. Almost instantly, my sister sent back another message, Thanks! You’re the best brother.

Her message brought a small smile to my face, a warmth that helped push back the unease simmering beneath the surface. But as soon as I looked up, my gaze landed back on the basement door, standing there like a silent challenge. I knew I couldn’t avoid it, so I took a deep breath and stood, telling Ellie to stay put and keep watching her show.

She gave a little nod, her attention glued to the screen, and I headed toward the basement door. I opened it, stepping into the stairwell, and as I descended, that unsettling chill crept back up my spine, my skin prickling as though the shadows themselves were brushing against me. I tried to shake it off, telling myself how ridiculous it was, how there was absolutely nothing to fear.

“Get a grip,” I muttered under my breath, gripping the railing tightly. I was an adult, for crying out loud. The dark had lost its hold on me years ago, so why was I letting it crawl back now? Each step down felt heavier, as if I were walking deeper into some unspoken dread waiting at the bottom of those stairs.

I flipped on every light switch I could find as I stepped into the basement, flooding the room with harsh, flickering light. The hum of the bulbs felt oddly comforting, like a barrier against the silence that had settled here. The shadows shrank away into corners, giving the basement an almost normal look. For a moment, I managed to shake off the tension, focusing on the rhythmic task of moving damp clothes from the washer to the dryer.

But then, just as I was nearing the bottom of the pile, a strange, uneasy feeling crept back in, sinking deep into my bones. Goosebumps prickled across my arms, and a chill slithered up my spine, like a thousand tiny legs scurrying up my back. I froze, my fingers gripping the last damp shirt, my breath caught in my throat. The lights overhead flickered slightly, and the sensation grew stronger, heavier, as if something just beyond my sight was watching, waiting for me to turn around.

I moved as quickly as I could toward the doorway, every step feeling like I was being watched, shadows stretching to reach me. Just as I was about to escape, a sound stopped me in my tracks—the unmistakable, slow rhythm of breathing coming from behind. My heart thundered, almost drowning it out, but the sound was there, steady, coming from the direction of the shower.

I froze, every instinct telling me to run, but something stronger—curiosity, dread, something unnameable—held me in place. Slowly, I turned, my legs shaky, the adrenaline making my entire body feel like it might give out. And then I saw it: a figure, crouched near the shower in the dim light, a mass of pure shadow, darker than anything around it, a silhouette that seemed to absorb the darkness itself. It looked twisted, almost monstrous, something that shouldn't exist in this world.

In an instant, it began crawling toward me, its movements jerky and unnatural, closing the distance with terrifying speed. A scream tore from my throat, and I spun around, racing up the stairs. Just as I reached the first step, something icy and firm wrapped around my ankle, yanking me back. I crashed onto the stairs, pain shooting through me, but I scrambled forward, clawing my way up, desperate to escape. I didn’t dare look back, focusing only on reaching the top, my heart pounding louder than my own footsteps.

I burst through the top of the stairs, slamming the basement door shut behind me with a force that rattled the walls. I collapsed against it, pressing my back to the door as if my weight alone could keep whatever was down there from following. My chest heaved, each breath shallow and panicked, as I braced myself for the sound of something clawing or pounding from the other side. But there was only silence.

“Uncle Mikey?” Ellie’s small voice drifted over from the hallway. She stood there, watching me with wide, innocent eyes, clutching her favorite stuffed toy. Her expression was filled with concern, and she tilted her head. “Are you okay?”

I swallowed hard, trying to force a smile as I pulled myself together. “Yeah, I’m fine, Ellie. Just... got spooked by a big ol’ spider.” I tried to laugh, and she giggled, her laughter light and carefree.

“Silly Uncle Mikey,” she said, shaking her head, and her laughter drew a weak chuckle from me, too, though inside, I was still shaken to my core.

I stood up, double-checking that the door was securely locked, then picked her up, holding her close. “Come on, let’s go back to the living room,” I said, my voice steadier now, but my grip on her tighter than before.

The rest of the night passed without incident, but the silence felt heavy, as if something were waiting, lurking just out of sight. When my sister and her husband finally returned, I felt a wave of relief wash over me. I couldn’t get out of there fast enough, but as I gathered my things, my sister pulled me aside.

“How’d it go?” she asked, her tone light, but her eyes searching. I forced a smile, saying it was fine, that Ellie was an angel, but she didn’t buy it. She watched me closely, picking up on the tension I hadn’t managed to shake off.

“Did something happen?” she pressed gently, and after a moment, I took a deep breath, feeling the weight of the night settle heavily on my shoulders.

I told her everything, hesitating before recounting how Ellie had screamed at something unseen in the corner of the basement. As I spoke, I saw a flicker of recognition cross her face. My sister went pale, her gaze shifting uncomfortably as she admitted that Ellie had done the exact same thing a few weeks before—freezing, staring, screaming as though she’d seen something no one else could. She had brushed it off as a nightmare, but now, with both of us having experienced it, the reality felt too close, too real.

I hesitated, then asked if she’d ever experienced anything strange down in the basement herself. I confessed that while I was down there changing the laundry, I could’ve sworn I saw something—a shadow or figure lurking in the darkness. My sister’s face tightened, her expression thoughtful, but she shook her head.

“No, not me,” she replied slowly. “Just Ellie. She’s done it a few times, getting really scared, staring at… well, at that corner.”

My heart skipped a beat as her words sank in. The corner. The exact same one that had terrified Ellie tonight. It wasn’t just one unsettling moment. It had been happening, over and over, and my mind raced, a horrible understanding dawning. Whatever Ellie had seen wasn’t just in her imagination—it was something real, something hiding just beyond the reach of the light, waiting in the shadows of that corner.

A strange, uneasy feeling kept me rooted in place as I wrestled with the urge to leave. Part of me wanted to run, put as much distance as possible between myself and that basement, but another part felt a deep, gnawing worry for my sister and niece. My sister reassured me, brushing off my concern, telling me they’d be fine. With a reluctant nod, I finally left, hoping that maybe I’d just overreacted, that it was my imagination playing tricks on me.

Back in the familiar safety of my own home, the tension slowly unwound. The silence was comforting now, and I started to feel grounded again. I decided a hot shower would help wash away the last of that eerie feeling, so I turned on the water and let it cascade down, the steam filling the bathroom like a warm cocoon.

As the water ran over my back, a sudden sting cut through the heat, sharp and burning against my skin. Frowning, I looked down, twisting to see the back of my leg—and my stomach dropped. Four wide, deep red scratch marks trailed down my calf, raw and unmistakable, as if something had clawed at me.

The realization hit me like a punch to the gut, a cold dread settling into my bones. Whatever I saw in that basement hadn’t been my imagination. It was real, something lurking in those shadows, something that could reach out and leave marks. And it was still there, left behind in that dark corner with my sister and my niece, hidden in the same shadows Ellie had stared at in terror.

A shiver ran down my spine, the fear clawing its way up, sharp and unrelenting. I wanted to believe it was over, that whatever had happened was just my mind playing tricks, but the evidence was there, raw and unmistakable, carved into my skin like a warning.",237,0.98,15,InformationRemote865,2024-11-10 22:25:37,1gojv7g,252,High
NoSleep,Every year we play a game where we write secrets and guess whose is whose. This year someone wrote: “I’m going to murder one of you.”,"Every year, we have this cabin trip, and every year, each of us writes a secret and puts it in the hat. After dinner we dump all the secrets out and start guessing whose is whose. It’s a fun activity that always teaches us new surprises about each other. Whoever guesses the most secrets correctly wins a basket. What the basket contains is different every year—everyone donates a gift.

This year, for example, my wife donated a box of fancy chocolates, “So that Kim stops eating yours,” she joked to me.

Dan often was the winner. A jovial extrovert, he was the glue that kept our friendships together long after college.

Melody won the basket nearly as often. An analytical thinker, she kept samples of our handwriting, and she usually spent quite a bit of time analyzing the slips of paper to try to ascertain who wrote which secret.

Then there was Zuri, who always made sure the basket had a bottle of (very) expensive wine. She didn’t even drink herself, but she liked the rest of us to have a good time. She was a terrible guesser.

Kim was our resident joker, always donating something silly to the basket, like “the world’s spiciest chip” or a giant gummi bear. He won the basket only once before.

Steve was the blandest guy imaginable, and usually donated something boring—bath products or pistachios or coffee. He never really got our in-jokes or quite fit in with the group.

Our tradition’s been going on strong ten years now. We’ve always had a good time. And that’s why what happened makes no sense at all.

My wife dropped me off at the cabin on a Friday evening. Kim, Steve, Dan, and Melody arrived, each putting slips in the hat. Zuri couldn’t make it this year but wine came with a note for us to enjoy ourselves.

After dinner, we pulled the slips out of the hat. Five slips of paper with our five secrets that read:

*I have a secret crush on someone.*

*I spent fifty-two cents on the prize I bought for the basket. :)*

*I have a star named after me.*

*It’s a girl!*

*I’m going to murder one of you.*

We read them all aloud, laughing and shouting guesses until we got to the last one. Everyone went quiet. Someone wondered if it was a joke—we all looked at resident joker Kim, but he said his was the fifty-two cents one. Everyone began snatching their slips, until each of us was holding a slip except me.

“It’s Mia!” They all said. “Mia’s planning a murder!”

“No I’m not!” I sputtered. “I wrote ‘I started a new diet’!”

Who had swapped my secret for the murder one?

To say that tensions were high would be an understatement. In the end, Dan suggested we skip the game and share the basket. But everyone’s mood was sour except for Kim, who happily ate all the chocolates and drank half the wine bottle himself. I wondered if he really *did* put that murder slip in there as a prank, just so we’d wind up splitting the basket and he’d get a share.

But the next morning, we woke up and found Kim lying blue-faced and wide-eyed in the bed, vomit staining the pillow and sheets beside him.

And suddenly we were all screaming, panicking, wondering which of us had done it. We hurled accusations while waiting for police.

“The wine,” said Dan. “He was obviously poisoned. It must’ve been the wine!”

“Maybe it was the chocolates,” said Melody.

“But they weren’t even out of the plastic wrapping!” I said.

“It was the wine,” Dan insisted. “Think about it. One of us wrote that incriminating secret, right? But Zuri’s got an alibi because she’s not here. The police look for someone involved in the game. And she gets away with murder in the perfect crime.”

“Okay, but how does she get the slip of paper into the hat if she was never here?” said Melody.

We reviewed the secrets again. Steve had a secret crush, Dan’s wife was having a little girl, Melody had a star named after her (“You know those are scams, right?” I told her). Mine was still missing.

That’s how all suspicion suddenly turned on me. When police arrived, everyone was interviewed. I was the prime suspect, even after I told police someone swapped out my secret slip about a new diet before we drew them from the hat. I even searched the trash cans and recycling but couldn’t find mine to prove my innocence. The remaining papers were turned over to check for fingerprints. The authorities took the wine bottle and what was left of the chocolate box too.

My friends all thought I was a killer. I *knew* one of them was.

Later that evening, when I was finally back home and still wondering who had lied, the dog was whining to go out, so I grabbed a coat and took him out. And suddenly everything clicked horrifyingly into place. We had *all* been right. Dan was right about the perfect alibi. Melody was right about the chocolates—not the ones in plastic wrap in the basket, but the ones in my bag that were supposed to be *mine,* that Kim stole like he did every year. And *I* had been right that my slip of paper had been switched.

Fear coursed through me as I pulled a crumpled slip of paper from the pocket: *I started a new diet*

All my life I’ve heard scary stories, from ghosts to killers. All the kids in my town would hush and whisper these stories in each other's ears. Telling that no story hit like a ghost story, but my opinion was always different. After all, we were the ones to create them.  Time and time again I would see and hear the heinous acts humans themselves commit. Murder, abduction, abuse, rape. All humans. I always found the horrors of humanity to be more bone-chilling than any demon or monster lying under mountains, or hiding in the shadows. At least that’s what I used to think. 

Markus and I had planned to go out to have a picnic. Markus had just turned 18 and wanted to celebrate his birthday by watching a meteor shower. I wasn’t the biggest fan of sitting out in the open, in the middle of the night, but he really wanted to so I folded. Markus was responsible for the drinks and I, for the food.  It was a thirty-minute drive and a fifteen-minute walk.  The sun was starting to set and I couldn’t shake that I was seeing shapes peeking behind the trees. Markus told me to stop being so weird and I quickly shut up.



I followed him to a small circular clearing between the trees. We set up our tent, and placed our blankets and food down, before lying down ourselves. We waited around an hour before the meteor shower actually started. It was amazing, I could see everything, and every star felt like it was right in front of me. I had never seen the sky so clear, the city I lived in was always too bright to see anything.  I never really went camping as a kid and definitely didn’t after this. 



“I’ve never seen a meteor shower,” I said.



 “Really, my mom and I always travel to see one when we can. Like a late gift, you know?” 



“makes sense, it’s nice,”



“It is. We should do this more .”



 “Watch meteor showers?” 



“No, I mean…” Markus turned to me. He looked at me for a while, shifting his glance from my left to right eye. “Can you pass me the drinks?” He finally said. 



I grabbed his bag and looked inside. My face dropped a little. When he said he packed drinks I expected lemonade, tea, or something, but what I saw was alcohol. Markus said it would only be this one time, and that I'd like it, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt, and eventually, Markus almost drank a whole bottle of…something, I didn't have as much as he did, but I felt sick. I’m not sure what it was, I just knew it tasted disgusting. Markus looked through his backpack for something.



“What are you looking for?” 



“Chocolate.” I sat up a little. 



“You brought chocolates?” I asked excitedly. 



He pulled out a small box of chocolate. “ Well, kinda.” He said. “I took them from the store.” He shrugged. 



“You stole edibles from the store?”



 “Yeah, sorry.” He said unapologetically before popping one in his mouth. 



“Markus!” 



He rolled his eyes. “Oh come on Billie, it’s not even that big of a deal, see” He put another one in his mouth. 



I had never done anything like that before, never a lick of alcohol, no weed, cigarette, or anything. I looked at him convinced somehow he’d die. I realized very quickly how stupid that idea was. He held out a hand, with a stupid grin on his face.



 “C, mon.” 



I gave him my hand.



 “I promise it won’t kill you.” He smirked.

  


 I loosened my grip, pulling my hand back. He laughed at me a bit, I will admit I felt a little embarrassed, maybe I was overreacting (I totally was.). 



“It does nothing, it’s just weed, at most it makes you giggle, or hungry.” 



I squinted a little.



“Close your eyes.” 



I reluctantly did so.  He opened my mouth and put a chocolate on my tongue. It tasted awful, not sweet at all. Half an hour later we were there laughing a little too loudly for the quiet night. After a bit, I got too dizzy to sit up, so I laid down on my back. Markus looked down at me and smiled. 



“Dizzy?” He asked. 



“Maye a little.” 



He pointed up at the sky. “See that.” He said. 



 I looked up but my eyes just couldn’t stay still enough to focus on any stars



 “No.” 



“Well, it's the Milky Way.” 



“Milky Way,” I said looking up at the sky. I put my arms above spreading my fingers apart, trying to focus on them. He looked at me.



“I know you know what the Milky Way is.” He said. 



“Yeah, I just, I just feel dizzy, can’t really hold a thought.” 



Markus laughed at me a little. “You still think you're going to die.” 



“Yeah.”



He leaned over me, looking down. “Your face is all red.” He laughed.



I covered my face with my hands. “Says you, you look like a tomato.” I smiled.



“Yeah, well, whatever,” he said. He looked at me for a while. I smiled at him.



 “Billie..” He said. 



“Yeah?” 



“I’ve been thinking,” he said slowly. “I’ve been thinking that maybe we could go ou-.” he fell silent. 



I looked over to see him looking out to the bushes. 



“Markus?” 



He clasped his hand over my mouth. “There’s someone in the trees.” He whispered. 



My eyes shot over to where he was looking,  I looked through the small split through the tent's side cover, but all I saw were trees, branches, and bushes. 



“You’re just drun-” 



CRACK. 



A branch snapped under pressure about thirty feet away. My eyes widened. It had to be some animal. We listened but everything was silent. No birds, deer, bugs, or wind. It was completely silent. I looked over at Markus. His breath was heavy and broken. He laid down pulling me next to him.



“Are you sure it was a person?” I asked.



“No, but it definitely wasn’t an animal, I heard it talking.” 



We laid in silence for a bit before we heard what I assumed was a deer. It was walking around for a little before starting to eat the nearby bushes, I went to sit up, but Markus pushed me down. “Don’t,” he whispered with desperation. I was about to argue when I heard a bone-chilling tear. The deer let out a screech of pain that left my ears ringing. After minutes of screaming in agony, we heard what sounded like individual tendons getting ripped apart, bones snapping, and flesh being torn, I could hear large spills of blood splash on the ground. After every ear the deer grew quieter and quieter until it went silent, I heard something large smack against the ground.



 Then we heard the chewing, fleshy raw chewing, I started to shake uncontrollably tears swelling in my eyes, It must have been a bear, no human could’ve done that, but as we heard the last tear, there was a groan, minutes of just mindless groaning, and shrieking from a deer, but deeper, so much deeper…until the first “Hello.” My body was struck with so much fear I couldn’t even shake, my body went completely still. 



Its voice changed from human to animal, male to female, young to old, before resting on a man's voice. “Help me.” It said louder. “Get away from me!” it said shrieking louder and louder. I looked up at the sky above me hoping whatever that thing was, wasn’t taller than the tent. It started to walk closer, blood dripping from its fingertips. It tapped the side of the tent. I could hear Markus whispering something under his breath but I couldn’t tell if it was a prayer or an apology. 



Markus shoved me down and covered my head and neck, I wanted to scream. I held my breath as it began to unzip the tent. Slowly but surely it got the bottom unzipped but stopped when a gunshot was heard in the far distance. It started to walk away, before breaking into a run pushing everything and anything in its path. We waited long after that thing's footsteps grew quiet. I poked my head up. Markus looked at me, his eyes not able to focus on me. 



“What the fuck?”He said, stammering.



“I...I don't know.” 



“I, we can’t stay here.” He said nervously.



 I looked at him, my heart still pumping. I just looked at him before laughing. 



“It’s fine, anything dangerous has already passed.” 



Markus looked at me. “No, everything safe is gone. We have to go, Billie. Come one.”  



Markus looked through the small slit before slowly opening the tent the rest of the way. “Please don’t hear me, please don’t come back, please.” I heard him whisper over and over. Once it was all the way open, he stared into the wilderness for a minute. He turned around and shoved our phones and anything else important in his backpack, and he grabbed me and we ran out of the tent. I could barely hold consciousness, everything around me looked like a blur. I must have blacked out because when I opened my eyes, Markus was flying down the road. He didn’t even think to drive me to my house, we just spent the night at his place. His mom was out on a business trip, which made our anxiety so much worse. 



We made sure every window and door was locked before we even went upstairs. I spent the whole night crying and shivering. The next morning, I woke up to the smell of something cooking. I slowly made my way downstairs. Markus was making breakfast for us, he was humming to himself like nothing happened.



“Good morning.” He said happily. 



“Good morning.” 



“Last night was a fucking mess, I was hallucinating like crazy.”



 “I heard it too Markus,” I said. 



“No, no, I think we were just out of it.” He said seriously before turning around and humming again.



I saw his arm started to shake. I nodded. 



“Yeah, yeah, I was so out of it.” I said drifting my vision to the window 



“I made eggs and toast.” 



“Thanks.” 



I sat at the table patiently waiting while he made my plate. I thanked him and started to dig in, but I barely got through my first egg before running to throw up in the kitchen's trash can. Markus held my hair behind my back. 



“C’ mon let’s go to the bathroom.” He ran me over to the bathroom nearby, I almost missed the toilet before throwing up again. I started to ball my eyes out. He had no clue what to do. He got up.



“Do you need water, Gatorade, you want me to stay?.” 



“I want you to shut the fuck up.” I gargled. 



He quickly sat down on the rim of the bathtub next to me. After an hour and a half, I was finally done. 



“ I, I wanna lay down,” I said. 



“Here let me get you something, and I’ll take you upstairs. He ran and grabbed something from the kitchen and came back with a bottle of water a flavor packet, and a bucket. “ here, take my arm.” 



I stood up weakly, my legs were shaking like crazy. Taking his arm he led me upstairs to his room. “I can just go back to the guest room.”



 “No, no it’s fine, my parents would kill me if their “nice sheets” got messed up.” He rolled his eyes. “Now just lay down, before you get dizzy again. He pulled the sheets out and laid me down.



 “I’m sorry I threw up,” I said embarrassed.



 “No, it’s fine, I already knew my cooking was bad anyway.” 



I smiled weakly. “You know that’s not it.” 



His face dropped. “It’s fine really.” He said before walking out. 



The rest of the day was awkward, He seemed so out of it. I didn’t blame him, I didn’t know what to make of it either, it’s like I both understood what happened, but I also didn’t like somehow I could explain it somehow with logic, but I couldn’t. It was around 6:30 at night when we were going to order some pizza. Markus offered to pay me back so he ran to get his wallet from his bag, but it was gone. He looked up at me,  his face went pale. 



“I left it in the tent.” He stuttered.



 We had to go back, lord knew I didn’t want to, but he kinda needed it. I told him we needed to get it but he insisted everything in it was replaceable, or we could go another day, but after arguing for an hour we finally got in the car, it was already dark out, so It made everything feel so much worse. Once we reached the spot we got out our flashlights and started to walk to the tent. It was an agonizing 15 minutes, we twitched at every sound, and the sense of death weighed heavy on our backs. We knew when we got close that we could smell flesh in the air, I stopped and was taken back to the day I found Gabe’s car.



I felt sick, and I could feel tears swell in my eyes. Markus looked at me with sympathy before pushing further into the darkness. When we reached the tent, we both grasped a little, It had been torn apart. We looked at each other hesitantly before walking closer. Markus pushed aside some of the cloth before searching through our stuff, he grabbed our food bag and finally, he held up his wallet. He stood up, wiping the dirt off his jeans. I felt a drop on my arm, I looked at my sleeve before feeling it again, I looked up to the sky, it was raining as if the darkness was bad enough. Markus started to move his flashlight around, searching. I looked at him confused.



“Where’s the deer?” He asked.



 “What does that matter? Let’s get the hell out of here.” 



“No, I want to see what it did, I need to.” He walked into the nearby bushes until he came across it. He said something to himself.



 “What? What’s wrong?”



 “I, I don’t know.” 



I walked next to him and looked down at what once was a deer. It was disgusting, It was torn to pieces, and I couldn't even tell what was skin and what was an organ. I looked at it closer, something was off, I couldn’t tell what it was, I just knew something was wrong with this deer. 



“Markus we need to leave.” 



He nodded and turned around. We walked in silence as the rain began to hit us harder every minute. I looked back behind me, I felt like something was there, just out of sight of the light. I turned to Markus, shining the light at him. My heart dropped. Someone was standing not even 20 feet away from us. I could just barely see their legs, but there was undoubtedly somebody there. Markus turned around, and he froze. His breaths became quick and sharp. The person stood completely still, but as I looked closer I could see something in their hand. I squinted, was it a stick, a pipe, I couldn’t tell. Markus took my flashlight from me slowly, before grabbing my hand. I looked at him confused, but I couldn’t see his face. I heard him count from three, before turning off our flashlight and running toward the car. 



I heard a shot ring out. I ducked my head. Another one rang out, it sounded so much closer this time. I heard them try to reload it, but I think they gave up because they stopped to run after us. Markus squeezed my hand tightly, pushing any branches aside.  I could barely see anything, my eyes hadn’t had enough time to adjust, I tried to make sense of what I saw in the moonlight, but the rain made it so much harder. Markus let go of my hand, He told me not to wait up and that the car wasn't far. I ran pushing branches out of my face, I could see the car, and a smile came across my face, but I got distracted with hope and I slipped in the mud. 



Markus pulled me up and we began to run when I heard something smack against Markus, He let out a scream and fell to the ground. I turned around and I could see the man standing over top of him. “You killed him!” The man screamed, “What are you?” He screamed again in almost desperation. 



The man smashed the end of his rifle against Markus’s face. Markus screamed, but the man didn’t care he raised his gun again. I looked around and there was nothing, I looked up at the man, still hidden by the darkness. I ran at him with all the force I had knocking him over. Markus got up and grabbed the gun. 



I punched the man as hard as I could, still seeing nothing but his outline. I felt a wave of pain go up my arm, it felt like I broke all the bones in my hand, and then I did it again.



“You killed him, You killed him!” He said screaming over and over. 



I hesitated and put my hand to my side. Something wasn't right, I didn't understand what he was saying.

Markus pulled me back. “Come on!” He grabbed my hand and rushed me to the car, he shoved the keys in the car and drove off.



When we finally made it back to my neighborhood, he pulled over slowly. He shut the car off and rested his head on the wheel. 



“How bad is it?” I asked. 



He looked at me, Half his face was covered in bruises. I winced a little. 



“Jeez, way to make me feel better.” he sighed.



 “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it!” 



He waved me off. “You probably should get inside, before your mom flips out on you.”. 



I nodded. I opened the door slowly and climbed out. 



“Goodnight.” I turned to look at him. 



“Goodnight.” He said, not looking at me. 



I shut the door and walked inside quietly. My parents were sleeping so I tried to stay quiet before I got to my room. I took a shower and went to bed. Markus tried his best to make his bruises go away before his mom got home that weekend, but they didn't. Markus told her he got into a fight with some kids and had to stay inside for a week. I told him to just tell her what happened, but Markus just brushed it off. 



He and I didn’t talk about what happened, and when we did, he would brush it off as us being drunk and hallucinating. We both wished that was the case. The man in the woods was found a few days later, I saw it in the paper. He claimed something attacked his friend while hunting the night Markus and I were out. Police said it was a bear, but Markus and I knew better. We both knew that thing wasn’t human.

NoSleep,I work at a lodge in my town. This is why I quit,"The night started out like any other—cold, quiet, just a light flurry of snow coming down. I was working the late shift at the Pine Hollow Lodge, a little inn tucked away on the side of a winding, half-forgotten road up in the mountains. It was mostly empty this time of year, except for the occasional stranded traveler.

It was around midnight when the phone rang. I jumped, hearing the old rotary phone shriek into the silence. There was a delay before anyone spoke, then a woman’s voice, soft and trembling, crackled through.

“Please… do you have any rooms left?”

“Yes, we do,” I replied, trying to sound reassuring. “But the weather’s picking up. If you’re not nearby, it might be better to wait until morning.”

“No, I…” She hesitated, and there was a strange rustling on the other end. “I don’t have much time. Please, I’m almost there. I have to make it before the snow traps me.”

It sounded odd, but people get anxious during snowstorms. So I reassured her again and told her I'd leave the light on for her. She thanked me and hung up, and I waited, glancing out the window every few minutes. The snow was falling thicker now, like a wall of white descending around the lodge.

About twenty minutes later, I heard a car crunch to a stop in the parking lot. I stepped outside, letting the bitter air rush into the warmth of the lobby. But when I looked, I saw nothing. No headlights, no car—only endless snow stretching out under the dim glow of the lodge lights. I shook it off, assuming maybe she’d parked around the bend or out of sight.

Minutes later, the door opened. She stepped in quietly, her face pale, lips almost blue, clutching herself as if she’d been out in the cold for hours. She looked… worn, like she’d been on a long journey through the dark. Her hair was tangled, wet with melted snow, and her eyes were wide, scanning every corner of the room.

“Are you alright?” I asked, feeling an eerie unease prickling up my spine. She just nodded, giving me a weak smile.

“Yes… I’m alright now. Just… a long drive.”

“Do you have any luggage?”

She shook her head, eyes shifting to the door as if expecting someone. “No, I had to leave everything behind. I just needed to… get here.”

I didn’t press her further. It wasn’t my business, and she looked like she needed rest. I checked her in quickly, handed her a key, and told her I’d be at the desk if she needed anything.

But as she walked down the hall to her room, I noticed her shoes. They left no wet footprints on the floor. I blinked, figuring I must be imagining things, but then a gust of wind rattled the windows, and the lights flickered.

For the next few hours, I tried to focus on paperwork, but I kept catching movements in the corner of my eye. Shadows, faint sounds of footsteps that would vanish the moment I looked up. The woman hadn’t called down for anything, and by three a.m., I was about to go check on her when the phone rang again.

“Please…” The same woman’s voice, but this time lower, frantic. “Please… you have to help me. I’m trapped in my car. I don’t know if I’ll make it.”

I froze, staring at the guest register, seeing her name scrawled there in my handwriting. “You’re here… you checked in an hour ago. Are you alright?”

There was a silence on the other end, then a horrible, strangled sound, like she was choking. “He’s coming… I see him. He’s walking through the snow. He’s—”

The line went dead.

Heart pounding, I hung up and sprinted down the hall to her room. I knocked, but there was no answer. I fumbled with the master key, feeling sweat run down my back despite the chill in the air. The door creaked open, and the room was dark, empty, the bed untouched.

I backed away, my mind racing, trying to make sense of what was happening. Then I heard footsteps behind me. I spun around and saw her standing at the end of the hall, eyes hollow, face twisted in a terrified expression as if she was looking at something right behind me.

I couldn’t move, couldn’t even breathe. Her lips moved silently, forming one word: *Run.*

Then I felt a hand on my shoulder—ice-cold, pressing down with an impossible weight. The air around me was filled with a smell, sharp and metallic, like old, rusted iron. I turned my head slowly, and in the darkness of the empty hallway, I saw a face. It was nothing human—just a dark, twisted grin under hollow, bottomless eyes, his face graying and cracked like ice.

I tore away, stumbling and running for the lobby, my skin crawling as I felt that icy presence following close behind. I didn’t look back until I’d burst out into the snow, the wind slicing through me, almost comforting after the suffocating cold that had filled the lodge.

I stared back at the building, panting, watching as the windows flickered with a sickly, pale light. And just for a moment, I saw her face there, pressed against the window, mouthing that single, desperate word: *Run.*

I never went back. And every winter since, I’ve heard stories about Pine Hollow Lodge, about the woman who appears in snowstorms, begging for help from the side of the road. They say if you stop, she’ll vanish, but her warning will echo in your mind long after you’ve driven away:

*He’s coming… and you don’t want to be trapped in the snow when he does.*",213,0.99,5,No_Focus8984,2024-11-10 20:28:48,1gohquf,218,High
NoSleep,Don't Stay at Your Parents' House Alone,"I (21m) stumbled across here a couple weeks ago and have been reading lots of the posts. I thought I would share a story that happened about a year ago that has changed how I view living alone.

 

At the time I lived at my parents’ house because the cost of living was so expensive. I was a university student working casual jobs and couldn’t afford to move out. One day, my parents left to go on a business trip in France and decided to make a family vacation out of it. It was in the middle of exam period so I couldn’t go, but they took my four siblings. I was ecstatic since I could have the whole house to myself.

They left early Monday morning. I looked forward to being “the man of the house” for the upcoming week. Everything was great until around 7pm the next night. I was driving back home on a long, dimly lit road leading towards my street. Suddenly, I spotted a bald, shirtless man walking alongside the street carrying a shovel. Even though I saw him momentarily, his figure is etched in my brain. He was as pale as the moon and his eyes were lifeless and empty. We live in a suburban area, far from any farmland, I couldn’t imagine what someone would need a shovel for at this time of night.

I kept driving. Checking no one had followed me, I drove into the garage and closed the door. “Of course no one followed me,” I chuckled to myself as I went about making dinner.

By the next day, I had convinced myself that he might have just been lost or had dementia or something. Having three looming exams around the corner helped me forget about the man. I studied at home that day, which meant I got to practice a new prelude for piano, as I studied music theory. I studied hard, only to stop for food and the occasional YouTube video until I noticed the time, 7:34pm. “Damn it,” I muttered as I realised that I had forgot to bring my washing in. It would have to go in the dryer now. I grabbed a basket and went outside, soaking in the soft night sounds of crickets and rustles in the leaves.

Suddenly, I heard movement down my driveway. Moving quietly, I tentatively approached the end of the driveway, outlined by a perimeter of bushes. “Hey, who’s there?’ I asked nervously. No answer. As I waited near the bushes, I braced myself for a shovel to come towards my face. There was only more rustle of leaves, then silence. I stood there for what felt like hours, waiting for someone to appear. But no one did. Returning to the clothes lines, I grabbed the basket and went back inside, ensuring the door was locked behind me.

It was now Wednesday, and I was more than just a bit nervous. I checked that every window and door were locked several times before leaving for university. I couldn’t focus in class, I was still thinking about the man I saw on Monday night. When I arrived home, I took out a packet of two-minute noodles and watched Breaking Bad. We live in a bigger house, which unfortunately means it creaks a lot more on its own when no one is making any noise. 

The house is equipped with a motion detecting system, but I don’t trust its accuracy, so I did laps throughout the house whenever I heard a creak that was a bit too loud. Every time I walked past the windows outlooking our backyard, I expected to see that pale face pushed up against the window looking inside. I wanted to call the police to just ask them to drive around my street and see if anyone was lurking, but I felt embarrassed for getting so worked up over no physical evidence. I decided against calling the police and shortly went to bed, accompanied by nothing but the howling wind outside.

It was now Thursday, which meant another day of practicing at home. Having finished my practice at around 8pm, I got up to make myself a sandwich. As I gathered the cheese, ham and lettuce for my sandwich, I paused to remember what I needed for school tomorrow. That’s when I heard it, a singular high-pitched piano note echo throughout the house. The blood drained from my face as I looked down the stairs of our home. I froze in fear, unable to move a muscle. Slowly, I turned and saw the motion detector panel. It consisted of six lights, one for each room a sensor was in. I saw the lights for Room 2, which was where I was, and Room 6, which was where the piano was. They were flashing. All I could do was watch as the light for Room 6 turned off and subsequently the light for Room 5 began flashing. It was then when I could hear running down the hallway.

Grabbing the knife on the bench, I ran for one of the bedrooms and lay underneath the bed. I could hear someone running up the stairs as I lay there. Walking around the kitchen table, they tapped their fingers on the bench. Holding my breath, I waited as he approached the bedroom I was hiding in. He entered the room, but all I could see were his legs. He stood there silently, peered into the closet, then turned and left. 

Now was my chance, I left the bedroom quietly, clutching at the knife. I crept down the stairs slowly. However, as I reached the bottom stair, a soft creak left the floorboards. I ran towards the front door, reaching for the keys that hung next to it. I could hear him coming as I tried to unlock the door. Once I flung the door open, I ran towards the end of the driveway, screaming for help.

The police were shortly called but couldn’t find anyone in the house or in the nearby area. After giving the neighbours the description of the man I saw on Monday, I was told that the description sounded like someone who used to live a couple of streets away, however he had gone missing six months ago. For the rest of the week, police patrolled my street for the next few days but didn’t find anything. 

But to this day, the image of the man walking down my street is permanently stuck in my head. I’ve since moved out into my own place, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t check the house carefully every time I come home late at night.",214,0.95,5,Sorry-Draft-7183,2024-11-10 19:55:04,1goh3bn,219,High
NoSleep,"I inherited my grandmothers lakeside house, but she never properly warned me.","My grandmother, when she was alive, lived on an old farm on the side of a hill in a remote village in northern Sweden, right next to a beautiful lake surrounded by mountains. Whenever we were there, we would spend all day swimming or fishing for perch and crayfish. Grandmother was however always very assertive that we must never get out on the lake during the night, though she never gave us any reason. I always assumed she worried that something would happen while no one was around to help.

Of course, time passes, and last year so did my grandmother. My grandfather died when I was very young, so my grandmothers passing left the house empty, and neither my mother nor any of her siblings were interested in moving out to the middle of nowhere. I, on the other hand, work remotely most of the time, and even though I don't really expect to work the land, the solitude sounded quite appealing. Along with the house itself, I inherited furniture, a tractor, some old farming equipment, and, of course, the small wooden rowing boat we would use whenever we were visiting.

I have a single neighbour, a strange old man named Lennart, who lives in a small cottage further up the hill across the road from me. He mostly likes to keep to himself, but I have offered to let him use the boat if he wants to do some fishing, and to help out with clearing snow during the winter.

One night after I had finally settled in, and was mostly unpacked, I stood by the window in my bedroom looking out over the lake. The moon was peaking out over the mountain opposite, and cast a beautiful glow on the still water. Suddenly, I was reminded of my grandmothers warnings not to go out on the lake during the night. Curiosity got the better of me, and I made my way down to the boat house.

As I made my way down to the lake, I heard footsteps, and a voice calling out behind me. Startled, I turned around to see Lennart. He seemed flustered and asked me, almost accusingly, why I was going down to the boat house at this hour. Confused, and a little annoyed at his sudden intrusion, I told him that I felt like taking the boat out for a little midnight trip since this was such a beautiful night. He insisted that going out on the lake during the night was unsafe! Had my grandmother not warned me?

In hindsight, I feel extremely childish about this, but his insistence just made me more motivated. I told him that I was fully aware of the risks of taking a boat out at night, but that I was a grown adult and capable of making my own decisions. Lennart grumbled, and I could tell that he was still very agitated, but he relented and with a grunt and a dismissive wave, started making his way back up the hill.

I pushed my boat out on the water and jumped in. The water was very still, and the combination of the moonlight, and almost complete absence of any sounds made for an incredibly soothing experience. I settled around the middle of the lake, perhaps 300 meters from the shore. At this point, I could see most of the houses in the village, and the neighbouring village. Looking over toward my house, I suddenly realised that Lennarts cottage was entirely dark. He usually had some lights on in the windows, so that was certainly odd, but I could only assume that he had blown a fuse. 

Around me, the stillness of the water was disturbed by bubbles. Before I knew it, the water was filled with frenzied activity, and with a lurch, the boat suddenly started moving back toward the shore. I was moving significantly faster than my rowing had taken me out onto the lake, and I was holding on for dear life. I worried I would crash into the boat house, but whatever pushed my boat along navigated it safely back to  the spot where I would normally keep it moored and it slid softly back on to land. I stood up, scared and confused, and looked around.

Three dark and bloated silhouettes emerged from the water. In the moonlight, they looked almost like soldiers in gillie suits, but they clearly wore no diving equipment. They approached swiftly, and grabbed me. The creatures smelled vaguely of fish and decaying vegetation, and they spoke in a language I could not comprehend. I managed to make out a single word that was repeated multiple times: ""mermolgard.""

They dragged me inside the boat house. One of them looked me dead into the eyes and covered my mouth as it made a gargled hushing sound. It's face was clearly not human, with bulging eyes without eyelids, two slits in place of a nose and no visible ears. I realised it was in fact not wearing anything. However, its leathery dark brown skin seemed to mimik the appearance of decaying leaves. Of course, I was scared nearly out of my mind at this point, but for some reason I didn't attempt to flee. The creatures seemed almost as scared as I was. So, I complied and kept quiet. They turned off the lights and settled down around me.

We waited in there for what felt like an eternity, but was most likely only a couple of minutes. The silence outside was suddenly broken by a loud splash and the sound of wood splintering. I could hear that something was emerging from the lake, followed by heavy, damp footsteps. From what I could tell, it seemed to be moving up the hill as the footsteps were getting more and more distant. As I sat in that boat house, my senses tuned to max by all of the adrenaline coursing through my body, the sounds of breaking glass and splintering wood reached us. Eventually the footsteps returned, and whatever had come after us out of the lake made its way back into the water.

A couple of minutes later, the three creatures that brought me into the boat house quietly exchanged a few words. The one that had hushed me earlier gestured that I was free to leave, and then they left. I could hear them going back into the water. I fell back against the wall and slid down to the floor as my adrenaline abated and the fear truly set in. I didn't move from that spot until the following morning.

My house looked like a crime scene. The front door, along with its frame, had been torn out of the wall and lay several meters away on my lawn. Most of my windows and furniture was in pieces, and pools of water dotted the floor throughout the house.

Lennart clearly knew more about the creatures that live in the lake. I resented that he hadn't been more forceful in stopping me from going out with the boat. However, logically I knew I wouldn't have believed him if he had started going on about monsters, and what was he supposed to do? Nevertheless, I marched over to his cottage and banged on the door until he eventually opened it. He seemed both surprised and relieved that I was standing there and he offered me a cup of coffee and an explanation.

The lake is inhabited by a creature known as Mermolgard and creatures known as the Vattnora. Generally, they live together in peace, but they have very different opinions on us humans. Lennart and my grandmother used to spend time with the Vattnora, and they understood some of their language. Their word for human roughly translates as ""foolish ones."" They say that humanity are not mature and they mostly settle with observing us. Mermolgard is an ancient creature that sleeps during the day and hunts at night. He is resentful of humanity for settling around his lake, eating his fish, and disturbing the darkness of the night with artificial lights.

I still live in my grandmothers old house, Lennart has promised to introduce me to the Vattnora, in their own time. I feel an obligation to thank them, and to protect others from Mermolgard. I will never go out on the lake during the night again, but I feel strangely safe to do so during the day.",458,0.98,13,Froglich,2024-11-10 09:57:59,1go3rg7,471,High
NoSleep,I decided to try “Forgiveness” Therapy.,"I met Dr. Harper about a year and a half ago. He was recommended to me by my sponsor in AA, who had nothing but good words to say about him. 

I’ve never liked therapy. There’s something just so forced about letting someone pick your brain; questioning you about how you feel and think, when you’ve already waded through all the possibilities in your mind. I’m not here to dog on therapy—it can be extremely helpful and lifesaving for some. For me, it felt gruelling, and no matter who I saw or where I was, I couldn’t bring myself to fully engage in the process.

I think a part of me just so desperately wants to be liked. I’d find myself saying what I thought they wanted to hear, and I’d charade a persona that wouldn’t allow them to get too close, or understand me too well. It felt too false—too unrealistic, and although that could be entirely my own fault, there wasn’t any way for me to act otherwise. I’d deduced that therapy simply wasn’t for me, and unless someone literally altered my brain chemistry by cutting and siphoning out neural pathways in my head, it never would be.

Dr. Harper was different. He only held sessions in his own home, and refused to start unless he’d cooked a meal to share between him and his patients. He’d send a message asking for what you’d want for dinner, and then go and cook the meal from scratch, regardless of how complex or difficult the recipe was. My sponsor, Jim, said he’d made him the best Kimchi Jiggae he’d ever had—second to his Mom’s, and it really felt like he was sat across from a family friend, all the way back in Korea.

Dr. Harper said that food was a way to really break down barriers; allowing people to feel more comfortable in a setting where they’d usually be adverse to sharing issues in. Therapy, to him, wasn’t just about talking things out, or feeling listened to. It was about knowing that you were safe, and safer than you’d ever been before. Somehow, food was the perfect key to  unlock that.

I’d asked for my Nonna’s—Grandmother’s—lasagna. My Mom wrote a recipe down for me once I’d left home, and I kept it—all crumpled to the point of feeling like fabric more than paper, and sent a picture to him. I didn’t expect it to be great; my Nonna’s recipe was long and gruelling, and required a ragu to simmer for 2 days straight. Yet, when I turned up to Dr. Harper’s apartment, the aroma brought me straight back to being a young bambino—kid—again. I was inundated with warmth and welcoming, and my shoulders relaxed against my will. 

We shared a few glasses of wine, and he pulled out the piping hot lasagne; crust bubbling and spitting with the fat from pancetta layered underneath. I was salivating at the mouth, and I knew from the moment the first bite was placed on my tongue, that this man must’ve made some deal with my deceased Nonna. How he could’ve replicated her recipe so perfectly was beyond me, but it truly allowed the walls I’d built up to crumble down in the same manner I chewed on those delectable layers of food.

He’d asked me why I was here; what I wanted to gain from this experience. So, I told him.

“My Dad wasn’t a bad man, but he did bad things.” 

A gulp. A swallow. A glug of wine and a wipe from his chin.

“How so?” 

An offering of more wine. I shouldn’t, because I drink. I took it anyway.

“He, um…”

A pause.

“He knew my brother was going down the wrong path, and he allowed it to continue.” I responded. Wiping my chin and giving a coy smile.

“Which was?”

He cocks an eyebrow.

“Dad…” I found it hard to speak, but knew that if I didn’t, I’d never be able to. I was tipsy, and fed enough, and this had to be the time to say my piece. My peace. “Dad was involved in the gang business—mafia, perhaps, but way less important to the community. He organised petty crimes… theft, extortion from non-payers…and drugs. Enzo helped with that.”

“The drugs?”

It seemed like no matter how much I drank, my wine glass never came close to empty.

“Yes. The drugs. Crack and cocaine, mostly.”

“I see.”

No matter how much I ate, my plate never seemed to decrease either.

“And what happened to Enzo?” Dr. Harper asked, swirling the wine glass in his hand.

“He died of addiction.” I stunted, feeling my appetite diminish. Perhaps it had sobered me, and I dabbed my napkin against my chin. “My parents are dead, now…and there’s no rectifying what had occurred. All I want to do is find peace in myself, and be able to live my life without the fear of making the same mistakes.”

I don’t remember much more of the evening, bar throwing up profusely in my toilet once I returned home. The next day, in my hungover stupor, I received a text from Dr. Harper, asking me if we’d like to continue the sessions. I felt like crap, so all I did was lug my body from the bedroom to the bathroom, and sit in a bath of lukewarm water—too hot had convinced me I’d boil alive, and too cold, freeze to death—and wait until my body could handle anything. 

Jim, my sponsor, called me at around 2pm; asking me how it was. I told him I’d drank, and he just laughed. He told me that was part of the process—make you realise how crappy alcohol makes you feel after a period of sobriety. I trusted him, he was my sponsor.

I responded to Harper. I told him that yes, I would like to see him again, but not in the same circumstances. No matter what Jim said, I didn’t want to end my sobriety again. He understood, and offered to meet at a coffee shop this time—early morning where we could just discuss some things that had been bothering me. 

That was last Tuesday. We met, had a conversation about my AA and how I may need to come to terms with forgiveness. 

Maybe I’ve been lying, or withholding information, but I don’t forgive. For the past three years, I’ve been trying to pin down a dealer by the alias of ‘Stacks’—a latino guy who deals fentanyl in the Manhattan 8th Avenue district. I’ve tried private investigators and everything, but because of my family’s history with gangs, it’s hard to discern any credibility. 

My conversation with Dr. Harper ended abruptly, and I will admit I was rude. I don’t want people to tell me that forgiveness for an unforgivable act is normal, or necessary, for healing. I want revenge for what Stacks did to my brother, and I will be doing the world a service by removing him from it.

I got back into drinking. I’d been sober for so long, and even the hangover didn’t help me continue. I kept drinking and drinking until I’d pass out in my apartment, and still continue. Jim stopped responding to my calls, and the AA meetings changed place—they weren’t at the Church anymore. I was so alone, until I got a text from Dr. Harper.

‘There’s a program for people like you—the FORGIVENESS program. It will help, I promise. It aims to relieve the stress and pain, and remove any negative feelings that impact you more than the persons you want revenge against.’

I was desperate. I needed sobriety—normalcy. I craved being able to think coherently and not just think about how to get my next drink. So I asked him:

‘When does it start? Where do I meet you?’


‘A block from my apartment. 65C Vemodig Road.’

So I turned up. I had no choice. It was either suffer and drink myself to death, or find out what could truly help me. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and it made me realise how much I’d been comfortable sharing my story with Dr. Harper in the first place. How I’d been able to break down those barriers and actually indulge in therapy properly.


He greeted me, in full scrubs, and asked me to come stand in the waiting room. The hallway was dark, and had a sole, dim, flickering light on the ceiling. He ushered me through a beaded curtain into a dingy room, which held an eclectic mix of people. A woman, sat in the far left-corner was cross-legged on a metal stool, biting her nails profusely. She was deathly thin, and covered in bruises—puss seeping from her seized-close left eye. A man, bleached blonde and acne-ridden, licked up and down her forearm, which was laden with puncture marks. On the other end, a man in a suit with terrible sniffles and a deviated septum continued to cough—pulling out his cellphone and continuing to lift it to his ear, and sigh loudly when there was no response.

In the middle sat a very fat, black woman who cried uncontrollably, wheezing with every breath she took. I decided she was the one to sit next to, as she seemed the least irritable and harmless. She continued to weep, and grasped my knee, pulling out a napkin to wipe her tears away.

“Are you alright?” I asked, sympathetically. She turned to me, frowned, and began to wail more. I put my hand in hers, and tried to soothe her. The man in the suit kissed his teeth.

“I-I’m sorry—it’s just, my son…he’s in there. This was the only thing we could do and—oh God, I’m a terrible mother!” She cried, gripping my hand so tightly my blood rushed to my fingertips.

“I’m sure that’s not true. Hey—look, I’m going in there soon. Sometimes the normal stuff don’t work?” I offered, and she ceased crying. She gripped my hand again, and gave me a nod to show appreciation.

“I thank you for that.” She sniffed, and sneezed loudly. “I hope you get what you need too.” 

She continued to rub soothing patterns on the palm of my hand, but I could never be sure if that was for me or for herself. I could hear the couple in the corner whispering foul things to each other, and the suited man tap his leather shoe aggressively on the ground. 

Eventually, a woman came into the room, asking for me. I could hear the tuts of despair from my fellow wait room mates, bar from the older woman who held my hand. Before I left, she grabbed my hand, and held it tight.

“Listen, Son. If you don’t feel comfortable, there’s nothing wrong with turning away.” 

Her eyes were warm, but warning. But I knew that if I continued to let my life go down this path, I’d never change. I gave her a smile, and let her hand go, and entered the room.

I wish I hadn’t. I wish I’d stayed with that nice woman and waited with her. God knows what happened with her son.

I must’ve been injected with something—a drug or whatever, because all I remember was waking up on a cold, hard floor. I felt sick, and immediately vomited the contents of my stomach (mostly beer) before me as I tried to stand up. A booming, female voice said:

“Subject rejected the sedative. Subject is more aware of their surroundings than anticipated.”

I turned. Intercom. It felt like a Saw trap. I gasped and cried for oxygen, the phlegm in my throat and nose blocking my airways. There was a hand on my shoulder. 

“Hey, stop. STOP! You’re fine. The sedatives hurt for a minute. We almost lost you.” 

I continued to gape for air. Fish out of water. Dr. Harper rubbed soft circles on my back, babying me with words of affirmation and encouragement. 

I couldn’t speak, I hacked up anything I had left in me up in bile and spit, and collapsed inwardly again; knees buckling to the ground and elbows folding beneath me. He continued to talk.

“Hey, hey…it’s ok. You’re safe. You’re fine. We won’t hurt you. We, um…we actually have a surprise for you.” He pulled me up, trying to stabilise me on my feet. “Wait, here, have some water. Usually the drug doesn’t wear off for a while—the fact you woke up so early means you’re a huge trooper, so good for you!”

Bottled water. I drank so much I couldn’t even fathom living without it. My head was snapped to the side, and I saw a dentist’s chair with a cover over it. A paper cover, which showed the wetness of tears, snot, and spit seep through facial organs.

“Can we get a chair for him, please? Christ, this is so unethical.” Dr. Harper screamed, and a double door that lay behind the body strapped to the chair opened, revealing a woman in a dental mask and scrubs run in with a wheelchair. 

Dr. Harper grabbed it from her and launched my limp body backwards into it, and held my head forwards to keep looking at the body on the dental chair.

“You’re a big boy, aren’t you? Don’t feel sad. You don’t want to forgive Stacks, do you, so you don’t have to anymore.”

He left my head lolling forwards, but I was able to feel sober enough to stare up at what was happening. Dr. Harper moved to the body in the dental chair and pulled off the paper sheet, revealing the drug dealer before me. 

Stacks was incredibly worse for wear. His eyes were almost swollen shut, and a deep, crimson crust littered his nostrils all the way down to his lips. He was almost unrecognisable, save for the ‘Viva La Vida’ forehead tattoo. He groaned and swayed, and his mouth was so full of blood that every time he tried to speak, he spat out bright-red liquid and phlegm.

I began to cry.

“You said you can’t forgive him, so what shall we do?” Dr. Harper asked, beckoning to the cameras in the corners of the room and slapping latex gloves on his hands. The woman from before entered through the doors and pushed a tray of dental ornaments into the room on a trolley. “Well only do what you want us to do, or, you can forgive.”

“I—I never wanted this.” I managed to slur out, my head lolling against my chest. I needed more water. Harper snapped his hands and the woman helped me drink some. 

“Yes you did. You said you wanted him to—Grace, the transcript?” Harper snapped, and she fans back with a crumpled piece of paper in her hand. Leathery, crumpled. Like grandma’s recipe.

He coughed. “I hope that bastard gets whatever comes to him. Black eyes, lost teeth. The man made me lose my brother because of some turf war. He purposely befriended him and spiked him. I hope he dies.” He looked at me, and smirked. “I will never forgive him as long as I live.”

He coughed again, ushering the woman to move away from the room. She does. 

“I’m asking you, Matteo, if you want to forgive, or forget.” He moves to Stacks, who lies on the dental chair. Stacks screams and cries, until Harper injects a needle in his neck. He becomes sedated. 

“He won’t feel anything, but you must tell me. Do you forgive, or do you forget?” 

I pause. I feel very ill, but I’m not strapped down. I can leave if I want to. I can go. So, I test my luck.

“May I go to the bathroom before I make my decision. I’d like to be alone.”

Harper looks at me, blankly, before nodding.

“Yes, that should be fine. Martha will take you.” 

A different woman—old and grey, and different to the one previously—takes me to the bathroom; a disabled toilet downstairs. She let me in, and here I am, now, writing this. I managed to pull off the disabled handlebar from the wall, and wedge it into the bathroom door handle. I’m so lucky they had a disabled toilet. 

I have to say, there’s no way I can get out of this. I tried to look, whilst I was escorted in the wheelchair, if there were any exits, but there’s just rooms for miles with screams emanating from them. There’s no way I can go downstairs without them seeing me. The woman who took me has a taser, and numerous injectables on her waistband. I just need to think; forget or forgive. 

I think I’ll go for forget. No matter how bad of a state he’s in, he killed my brother. I can’t, in good conscience, forgive him.

EDIT: The nice man at the facility gave me a good good treatments. I forget what J was supposed to say but I know I need to say this. Forggeting feels way better than fogivness. My head now feels a lot better now we have an open mind that we neve had before.",106,0.97,6,MouseCurtains,2024-11-10 16:30:06,1gocusf,112,High
NoSleep,The Idol of Baphomet,"Rainbow Creek isn’t the most interesting town, and it likely wouldn’t exist at all if not for the two colleges it was built around, or the federal prison a few miles outside of town. It’s a small city nestled in the Montana mountains, and while the locals are happy to live the small city life, college students, like me, crave things that remind us of the cities we came from.

That’s what brought me into Gannon’s antique shop. Back home my mother would take me antiquing with her. She had a taste for the old and unusual, and as I was nearing the end of my first semester of my freshman year, I found myself feeling homesick. So, one day, as the cold late autumn air nipped at my skin on my evening walk, I finally decided it was time to drop into the old antique store.

There was an old bell that rang as I opened the door, and the old man behind the cash register barely acknowledged my presence, looking up from a stack of old documents he was reading that I guessed must have something to do with the jeweled sword laid out on the countertop.

I started browsing the wares and was quick to notice that this was unlike any antique shop I’d ever been in before. The antique stores I was used to shopping at with my mom had old things, some up to maybe two-hundred years old, but this place was in an entirely different class.

Old was not a strong enough word for many of the items old man Gannon had for sale. Many of them would be better classified as antiquities. The newest item I found was labelled as being from the year 1852, but most were older than the fifteenth century, and some were even marked as being over two-thousand years old.

It was one of these older items that caught my attention. It was a bronze figurine, roughly six inches tall of a winged, goat-headed, hermaphroditic creature with serpents crawling across its belly. The craftsmanship was exquisite, showing every detail in clear relief with such a lifelike appearance that I could almost see it move. The eyes were made of some kind of deep red jewel that seemed to glint with a light all their own. The body was completely corrosion-free and shone like it had just been polished.

It was ugly and beautiful. It was alluring and horrifying.

I had to have it.

I checked the label next to it. It read simply *Idol of Baphomet Circa 500 CE $3,600*.

I was no expert on ancient artifacts, but I did know that high quality art from before the renaissance was ridiculously expensive, and this figurine, this idol, was far more finely crafted than anything I had seen in museums. If it was real, it was a true masterwork of antiquity, and that made it vastly underpriced.

Still, $3,600 is a lot of money. It was, in fact, exactly as much money as I had in my bank account after paying bills for the month. I’d been saving for a rainy day, setting aside something from every paycheck I’d received since I got my first part time job at the age of sixteen, and it represented my life savings, but this idol was too good an opportunity to pass up.

I took it to the checkout counter and got old man Gannon’s attention. “I want to buy this,” I declared.

He looked at me, and he looked at the small idol I had set on the counter, then back at me again. “I don’t think you want that particular item,” he replied. “It’s special. You don’t pick it, it picks you.”

I scoffed. “Don’t insult me old man!” I replied testily. “I may just be a student, but I have enough money for this!” I handed him the label with the price listed, and he examined it intensely.

“That’s not the price I put on it,” he said slowly.

“It’s the price,” I replied hastily, sensing that the old man was going to claim the idol was supposed to cost more before jacking the price up. In fact, I was certain of it. An item of that age and quality was definitely worth more. He probably left a zero out of the price by accident.

It’s the price,” I repeated, and I have exactly enough money to pay for it.” I produced my debit card from my wallet and held it out to him.

He stared at me thoughtfully for a moment before taking my card and running it. The charge came up as good.

“It seems the idol has chosen you after all,” he said, and I could swear I detected a hint of sadness, maybe pity in his voice. “Be careful with it.”

“Wait here,” he commanded, then went into the back room before reappearing a minute later with a binder. “This is the provenance of your antique,” he said in a businesslike tone. “Be sure to read it as soon as you get home. It tells you the story of this particular item as far back as is known. There are gaps in the history, but that’s expected for an item of this age.”

I took the binder from him and flipped it open. It was filled with documents in protectors, half of them old and in other languages, and the other half new translations to English placed in a separate protector behind each original document.

“Don’t forget to read them,” old man Gannon said warningly as he packaged my new idol for transport home. “Always know the details of anything you buy, new or old.”

“Sure thing,” I said dismissively as I took the package from him and scooped up the provenance binder. “I’ll read it at my first opportunity.”

If only I had actually done as I said, maybe I wouldn’t be in the position I’m in now.

I hurried home with my prize and placed it in the center on my desk’s bookshelf.

I stepped back to admire it, snapped a picture with my phone, texted it to my mom, and called her to tell her about my amazing find. We spoke for a little more than an hour, a lot of our conversation being speculation about the true value of such an artifact, wrapping up with a promise that we would take it to an appraiser when I came home for the summer.

It was early evening by that time, and all of my friends were done with classes for the day, so I put the binder of provenance on the bookshelf, left to go party with the girls, and promptly forgot about it.

I got home late and exhausted, so tired that I fell into bed fully clothed, and I swear I was asleep before I even hit the mattress. I had vividly troubled dreams. Visions of damned souls screaming in eternal torment in Hell. Images of violence and bloodshed among the living. Lies, pain, and betrayal were all around. Behind it all, ever in the background, was a winged, goat-headed figure with glowing red eyes and an evil smile splayed across its caprine lips.

The next day was tough, not just because I stayed out too late and my first class was early, but also because my dreams seemed to have sapped the rest from my sleep, leaving me slow and foggy all day long. I barely made it through my classes, went to my dorm, and promptly went to bed despite it being early afternoon.

My dreams remained troubled, filling my head with the same visions as the night before, only closer, more present this time. I could swear I actually smelled the stench of sulfur and burnt flesh. I could feel the pain and anguish of betrayed lovers. I could taste the iron blood in my mouth as people were gruesomely murdered.

Mixed in with the overwhelming cacophony of torment, I began to feel my own response. Horror and revulsion gripped my heart, and I felt like I was suffocating, barely able to breathe as I choked on the smoke of billions of damned souls. I felt physical pain, and my mind screamed to wake up, but I could not. I was trapped in the hell world of my dreams, and there was no escape. I was bound to sleep, forced to suffer along with the many, many tortured souls that filled my every sensation.

It felt like a lifetime that night, and when I woke up to my alarm blaring next to my head, it was with a great gasp for air, trembling, and a racing heart that took many minutes to slow down as I went from gasping to hyperventilating as the panic overwhelmed me. It was only when I was able to convince myself that it had all been a dream, a horrible, horrible dream, and the waking world was safe that I finally was able to slow down my breathing, and eventually get myself under control.

I looked over to my desk and set my eyes upon the idol of Baphomet sitting in a place of honor where it was easily visible. Seeing it, I was reminded of how the demonic figure in my dreams had taken on the form of my new relic, and I wondered for a moment if the two were somehow connected. I walked over and picked it up, examining it closely from all angles. It was so lifelike, and the gem eyes were so lustrous that they seemed to glow much like the eyes of the dream demon.

“How peculiar,” I muttered quietly. “Why are you showing up in my nightmares? You’re beautiful.”

I stared into the luminous gemstone eyes of the idol as I spoke, and it felt as though they were staring back at me until I finally set it down in its place of honor and left to attend my first class of the day.

My friend, Geraldine, could see that I was out of sorts during our first class and caught up to me when it was over. “What’s going on?” she inquired. “You look like something’s eating you.”

“You have no idea,” I replied exasperatedly.

“Then give me the idea,” she quipped.

Her manner may have been on the sassy side, but I knew she was sincere. “I’ve been having nightmares the last couple of nights,” I told her. “Real bad ones, and they feel more like I’m actually there than like I’m dreaming.” I trailed off at the end, then continued. “But that’s ridiculous, right? They’re just dreams. I don’t really feel, smell, and taste anything in them any more than I see and hear in a normal dream. At least . . . I don’t think so.”

Geraldine looked thoughtful, her thin, arched eyebrows pinched in concern. “I don’t think so,” she replied. “But then I’ve never heard of people dreaming in all five senses before. Maybe we should head over to the library and check out a book on dreams.”

I shook my head. “No, you can go if you want to, but I have enough dream stuff on my mind without researching brain patters or mythology.”

Geraldine cocked her head to the side. “Fine,” she said. “Then how about we blow off some steam by skipping class and day drinking in your dorm room? I’ll even bring a dimebag to share. Your roommate dropped out. Nobody’s going to bother us while we have our own little party.”

“I have to admit that sounds like fun,” I replied with a smile. “And I could definitely use something to clear these thoughts out of my head.”

“Great!” she chirped happily. “You head home, and I’ll meet you there in an hour with everything!”

Geraldine was true to her word, and she showed an hour later, almost to the minute, with a backpack full of beer, a flask of whiskey, and a baggie of weed and rolling papers.  We launched right into our private party, leading off with a couple of boilermakers before lighting a couple of joints. Underage drinking and drug use be damned, I felt happy and free for the first time since the nightmares began.

We chatted like we always do, about anything and everything, everything that is, except my nightmares, and the distraction proved good for me. Having those dark thoughts pushed aside for a little bit of chemically enhanced normalcy was exactly the medicine I needed.

After our fifth game of Uno, Geraldine happened to look at my desk and notice the idol for the first time. “What’s that?” she inquired, curiosity taking over.

I walked over, picked it up, brought it to the table, and set it down in between us. “This is an antique idol of Baphomet from the sixth century,” I informed her. “I picked it up at Gannon’s a couple of days ago, and I’m pretty sure I got it for way less than what it’s worth.”

Geraldine was fixated on the small idol. “May I pick it up and take a closer look?” she asked. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”

“Go right ahead,” I replied with a wave of my hand. “Just don’t drop it. I’m taking my mom out to get it appraised with me this summer. If it’s worth bank I’m selling it, and I want to get top dollar.”

She picked it up carefully and turned it over this way and that as she examined it closely. “I didn’t think people knew how to make such detailed sculptures back then,” she replied. “The details are finer than even the greatest Greek and Roman master sculptors, and art was in decline in the sixth century.”

“You would know that Ms. Art Major,” I laughed.

She looked concerned. “I’m serious,” she replied gravely. “The work is too detailed to be a bronze sculpture from that time period. How do you know it’s not a fake?”

My jaw dropped in surprise. “I . . . I never thought about that,” I stammered. “I bought it at Gannon’s, so I just assumed the old man wouldn’t rip me off.”

“Did he give you any documentation we can use to validate it?” she asked.

It took me a moment to remember, but when I did I got up and went to my bookshelf. I pulled out the binder old man Gannon had given me and brought it to Geraldine. “He gave me this,” I stated. “He called it provenance.”

Geraldine set the idol down and took the binder from me. She opened it and flipped through the pages, quickly glancing at each document, taking only long enough to note that the originals showed the proper signs of age before moving on to the next page. She nodded her head approvingly. “This is good,” she said brightly. “Have you read any of it yet?”

I shook my head. “No. He said I should as soon as possible, but I’ve been too busy and tired to bother.”

“Mind if I borrow this then?” she asked. “I’d love to learn the history of this little demon of yours.”

Something about the word demon shook me slightly as the word rattled around in my brain. I dismissed it as nothing more than the jitters from two nights of vivid nightmares. “Go right ahead,” I accented. “You’re better qualified to validate this art stuff than I am.”

“Great!” she replied happily as she closed the binder. “Now how about you put your demon back where it belongs and have a rematch?”

And that’s what we did until the hour was late and we were both thoroughly faded. We said goodnight, and Geraldine took the binder with her.

My dreams that night were less intense. The hellish torments and violence were replaced with a singular vision of Baphomet seated atop a throne of bone with rivers of blood flowing out from the base. He spoke to me in a deep voice, speaking a dark language that I could not understand. With each word, I could feel a sensation in my brain like thin threads wrapping around the inside of my skull.

The great demon said something I didn’t understand, but the tone made it clear that it was a command. I obediently approached the throne and held out my hand. He took it in one great hand, and his grip was like a vise though I did not resist. He closed his other hand, leaving only his index finger outstretched, then he lowered it to my open palm and drew his long, sharp talon along it, leaving a deep, bloody gash behind.

I felt the sting as his claw pierced my skin, and the slicing burn as he cut my palm open, but I did not scream. He let go of my hand and stretched his arms and wings out wide as he stared so deep into my eyes that I could swear he saw my very soul. Under some compulsion, I raised my cut and bleeding hand, and pressed it against his bare chest, directly between the breasts, right over his heart.

Something surged through my body, and it was both exquisitely delightful and exquisitely agonizing at the same time. It branched like lightning through every organ and limb and sat in my brain like fire.

Then I woke up, my alarm blaring, telling me it was time to get up and get ready for class. I turned it off, sat up, and that’s when I noticed the severe, throbbing pain in my right hand. I looked at it and screamed in horror.

My hand was cut across the palm, blood oozing slowly through a fresh, partially cauterized wound, just like it was in my dream.

The amount of panic I experienced at this is beyond my ability to describe. I screamed, and I kept screaming until people began pounding on my door. If I hadn’t stopped and answered it, they would have battered it down to rescue me from whatever had me screaming so loud and long.

Several people offered to escort me to the doctor when I showed them my garish wound, but I refused. They would have asked questions, and my answers would have made me look crazy. Who would believe that I merely went to bed, dreamed about a demon cutting my palm, and woke up to a slashed hand in real life? They would think I was either crazy or having a mental breakdown.

I lied and told them it was an accident, that I was only screaming in pain, and that I would go to the doctor. None of it was true.

I called Geraldine, and she didn’t answer her phone. I called again, and again, and again to no avail. I went to her dorm, and her roommate didn’t know where she was. She didn’t come to class.

I was fully freaking out by the time I returned to my dorm and was fully relieved to see Geraldine waiting at my door with the binder of provenance, and a dusty old book that looked like no had read it in years.

She didn’t wait for me to acknowledge her. “We need to talk in private, now!” she insisted, dispensing with all of our usual pleasantries.

“Okay,” I said dumbly, taken aback by her alien demeanor. I unlocked my dorm, and we both entered.

No sooner was the door closed than Geraldine began to speak rapidly. “We have a problem,” she blurted. “A big, big, giant, humongous, gigantic problem!” She hurried to the table without waiting for a response and put the binder and the book down on it. “Sit,” she insisted.

“Wait,” I replied. “Whatever it is, I think we need a drink.”

She nodded in agreement, and I retrieved a couple of beers from the fridge, cracked them open, set them down on the table, and took my seat. Geraldine responded by picking up her beer and chugging it faster than I had ever seen her do before. She looked like she thought it might be the last beer she ever drank, and didn’t want to waste a moment downing it.

She slammed the empty can down on the table, belched, and tapped the binder with her free hand as she wiped her mouth on her sleeve. “I couldn’t sleep last night, so I read this,” she began hastily. Catching herself, she slowed down. “I couldn’t sleep because I was having the same crazy nightmares you told me you’ve been having, and I woke up having a panic attack after just an hour of sleep. So, I decided to read the documents your little statue came with.”

“Idol,” I corrected. “It’s an Idol.”

“I know that” she growled testily. “Stop being pedantic and listen to me. If these documents are telling the truth, we have a big problem, and we have to find a way to fix it!”

I took a big drink of my beer. “I think you’re right,” I sighed. “I had a different dream last night, but when I woke up I had this.” I showed her my right hand, and her eyes grew wide at the sight of the gash across my palm.

“Oh . . . no . . .” she said slowly. “No. no. nonononono!” She grew more frantic with every no. “It’s really happening! God help us, it’s really happening!”

“What’s happening?” I asked seriously.

She looked into my eyes with a fixed, panicked stare. “Baphomet, the real Baphomet, is coming for us.”

I shook my head in disbelief and took another swig of beer to calm my nerves. What she said was unbelievable, but she obviously believed it, and it was enough to make me question my own firm belief that nothing supernatural is real. “That’s impossible,” I replied without conviction. “And even if he were coming for me, why would he come for you?”

Geraldine opened the binder to spot she had bookmarked and tapped the page repeatedly with her finger. “It says here that the idol finds those whom Baphomet has chosen to be his servants. It says that he comes to them in their dreams, and after tormenting them with visions of their future, he binds them to him in an eternal blood oath.”

“No . . . way,” I said hesitantly, my lack of conviction apparent in every syllable and pause. “If that were true, there would be records, a lot of them!”

Geraldine turned her hands to point down at the binder. “There are,” she insisted. “Right here! Over a hundred of them. They are personal accounts and eyewitness accounts of the people who once owned your idol, and what it did to them and those around them. It’s dangerous!”

Old man Gannon’s words echoed in my memory. “Be sure to read it as soon as you get home,” I murmured.

“What?” Geraldine asked, not quite hearing me.

“Old man Gannon told me to make sure to read the binder as soon as I got home,” I replied. “I didn’t, and you’re starting to make me think I should have.”

She turned the pages back to the first one, then flipped to the English translation. “Read this!” she commanded, sliding the binder over to me.

“Beware the Idol of Baphomet,” I read aloud. “This graven image is no mere trinket. It is empowered by the demon lord himself, and failure to perform the proper rituals will result in your doom.”

I looked up at my friend. “This is serious?” I asked, already knowing the answer, but wishing for a different one.

She nodded gravely. “It goes on to give a detailed ritual that must be performed before you go to sleep any day that you touch the idol once it comes into your possession. Failure to do it opens you up to Baphomet and allows his influence to spread to others through you if you let them touch it too. They can cleanse themselves with the same ritual, but it has to be done before they go to sleep, or else he can claim them too.”

“Then let’s do the ritual!” I blurted. “Let’s do it now and get it over with, and never touch that accursed thing again!”

Geraldine shook her head with tears welling up in her eyes. “It doesn’t work that way,” she said sadly. “Once he’s in you, he’s there to stay. This binder is filled with people’s failed attempts to regain their freedom once they let Baphomet in, and nothing worked. No exorcism. No ritual. No holy trinket. Nothing released them from the demon’s grasp.”

I felt a crushing weight inside my chest as her words sunk in. I sat back in my chair, fully deflated. “So, there’s no hope,” I said resignedly. “We’re both doomed.”

“Maybe not,” she replied with faint hope. One of the documents mentions a book called, well, in English it’s called the Tome of Dreams. I went to the library as soon as it opened hoping to find a translated copy, and I did!” she held up the dusty old book triumphantly.

I spent my entire day reading it, and it mentions a way to fight back, but it has to be done inside the dream itself. But there’s a catch!”

“And?” I inquired impatiently, not liking the theatrics.

“It says that if you fail, your fate is sealed, and the totem that brought the demon upon you will seek out a new servant.”

“Well, that’s not high stakes at all!” I said sarcastically. “And what happens if we do nothing? If I just keep the idol and go about my life as best I can with completely messed up dreams?”

She gave me a serious, fixed gaze that demanded and held my attention. “The same thing, only slower as he gradually hollows you out and enslaves you to his will.”

I felt utterly defeated. “Then I guess we have no choice. What do we do?”

“Not we,” she corrected. “I. I am the most recent person touched by Baphomet’s influence. I have to do it first, and if I succeed, I can guide you through it, both here, and in the hell world.”

“You mean the dream world?’ I asked.

“No,” she said flatly. “These dreams aren’t dreams. They’re us, literally us, our souls, being taken to Baphomet’s realm in Hell. It’s a hell world.”

It took a moment for the gravity of her revelation to properly sink in. “Well. That . . . sucks.” I groaned.

Geraldine produced a thermos from wherever she had it hidden on her body. How had I not noticed it before? “Tonight, before going to bed, I’m going to drink this. It’s a tea made from a blend marijuana, peyote, and ayahuasca. It’s a shamanic thing with no connection to the Judeo-Christian tradition that Baphomet belongs to. It taps into the older, pagan era when he was worshipped as a dark god. I’m going to drink this. Perform the ritual in the hell world itself, and free myself of this curse before helping you do the same thing.”

I was out of my depth. What she told me made no sense, but I could not deny the physical proof cut into my own hand. I wanted to deny it. I wanted to scream that it was all nonsense. I wanted to laugh and call it absurd. I wanted anything other than to admit the truth and face reality.

The reality is that I messed up big time. As big as anyone can mess up and not only was I paying for it, but so was my friend and classmate. And it was all my fault.

It was my fault for buying the idol in the first place. It was my fault for ignoring old man Gannon when he told me the idol was not for me. It was my fault for ignoring him again and not bothering to read the binder he gave me and warned me to read. It was my fault for letting Geraldine touch the idol after these previous faults. It was all mine, and I hated it, but I was impotent to do anything about it.

Geraldine drank her potion and went to bed in my dorm that night. I don’t know what she did, but my own dreams were peaceful at first. They were nothing more than the ordinary, meaningless drivel of a mind sorting out what it had been taking in.

Then, at the end, everything shifted suddenly, and I found myself in Baphomet’s throne room once again. I saw him lift Geraldine up with one clawed hand until she was left dangling over the edge of the throne. She gasped as she clawed futilely at his iron grasp. He spoke in that same strange language, his deep voice resonating throughout the room and my own body and mind.

I could not understand the words themselves, but, somehow, I knew their meaning. “Failure. Now take your place forever!” Then there was great snap, and I saw Geraldine’s head suddenly coked too far to one side, her mouth hanging slack, staring straight ahead with lifeless eyes.

Baphomet turned his fell gaze upon me, and spoke again, and I knew, somehow, I knew, he was promising terrible, terrible things, and I would live long enough to regret my mistake before he took me to spend eternity at his side in Hell.

That was six days ago. At least, that’s what the calendar on my computer is telling me right now. My body is cut up and bruised, and I hurt to my very soul.

When I came to this morning, Geraldine was missing. There is only a bloodstain where she had lain to go to sleep that night. The idol is missing too. Where it went, I cannot know. Honestly, I hope Geraldine somehow survived, that my dream was a lie, and she took the accursed thing to destroy, or, failing that, hide it where no one will ever be cursed by its presence again.

But I don’t think that’s what happened. My head is filled with fuzzy visions of terrible deeds, seen through my own eyes, but as though I am merely an observer in my own body, like someone else was in control the whole time.

I went online and searched up the strange visions in my head, and they are all real. The murder of a family of five two days ago, slaughtered with such brutality that the cops are unsure if it was man or beast that did them in. the torture of a classmate out in the woods, left for dead once she was too weak from blood loss to scream anymore. A cinderblock dropped from an overpass, smashing the windshield of a passing car below, causing it to careen out of control and cause a forty-car pileup with over a dozen fatalities.

These visions, and more, so many more, were all true. The last six days have been marred by murder and mayhem, and I know that I am at the center of it all. These bloodstains on my clothes are not only my own. They are the blood of my victims, too many victims, and the memory of the atrocities I committed are coming back like a crashing wave.

The dreamlike fog I first saw them in, the faint whisp of a memory that first set to my task of researching them has been blown away. I know what I did. I know my crimes. I know that I was not in control of my own body as I committed them.

And I know that I liked them. God help me, I liked them.

I know I should turn myself in. I know I need to go to the police, confess, and have them throw in solitary confinement before I fall asleep again. But I can’t. I won’t.

My will is no longer my own. My will, my body, and my soul belong to Baphomet. I am his to do with as he pleases. Six days a week I am bound to labor for him. One day only, the Lord’s Day, I am free to do as I will.

Even if I wanted to, I don’t know if I could turn myself in. I don’t know if Baphomet would exert his will or influence to stop me. I am bound to him now, by blood I am bound, and nothing can change that now.

What I can do is tell my story. I can warn you that if you find the idol of Baphomet, do not take possession of it. Don’t even touch it. The binder with the protection ritual is gone now. Destroying it was the first thing I did when my master took over my body. Without it, you are as helpless to resist him as I was.

I know what I should do. I know I should go to the police. I know I should end myself if I don’t imprison myself. It’s the right thing to do, but the truth is, all I want to do is go to sleep and let my master take control for the next six days.

I just hope he doesn’t follow through on his threat and take me home. I know his intentions for my family, and I have seen his handiwork firsthand.",40,0.9,4,DJ_Storytime,2024-11-10 19:34:30,1gogpe7,44,High
NoSleep,My parents never explained why we had to play the Game of Silence.,"My parents never explained why we had to play the Game of Silence. All I knew was that, every night at exactly 10 PM, we would sit in the living room, completely still, our lips sealed tight. Dad would set the kitchen timer, and that’s when the game would officially begin. We weren't allowed to make a single sound until the timer rang again. The rules were strict, and breaking them? Well, I’d rather not think about what happened when we did.

I made a mistake once when I was younger. It was just a cough. One small, innocent cough. But the moment the sound escaped my lips, I felt it. A sudden, icy brush against my skin, like something sharp and cold dragging across my shoulder. My skin split open, thin and precise, like a paper cut made by something unseen.

Even as a child, I knew. I knew that if I screamed, if I made even the slightest noise, I wouldn’t survive the night. My parents didn’t need to yell or scold me. The terror in their eyes, the pale horror etched into their faces, told me everything. That night, after the timer finally rang, my dad took me aside. “You can’t ever break the rules again,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “They don’t like it.”

After that night, I learned to hold my breath, no matter what.

The rules were simple: no talking, no moving, no noise. I never understood why. There was never any explanation, just the same old ritual.

Now, years later, I still don’t know who they are, but I do know one thing: when you break the rules, they can touch you.

Tonight, the house feels wrong. Something in the air is different. Mom has been nervous all day, pacing the kitchen, wringing her hands. Dad hasn’t said a word, but the tightness in his jaw tells me he’s just as worried. My little sister, Emma, clings to her stuffed rabbit, her eyes darting around the room like she can see something the rest of us can’t.

The timer ticks down. The silence is suffocating. My heart beats in my chest, loud enough that I wonder if it counts as noise. I keep my eyes focused on the floor, trying to block out the rising tension. But then there’s a noise: a soft thump from upstairs. It’s faint, but unmistakable. Something fell. My pulse quickens. Dad’s grip tightens on the armrest. We all know what happens now.

Nothing happens at first. We sit frozen, waiting. Then, the footsteps start, slow and deliberate. They come from upstairs, moving toward us. Mom’s breath hitches. Emma squeezes the rabbit tighter. We’re all on edge, waiting for what’s coming next. The sound grows louder, closer. My chest tightens, fear curling around my spine like an icy hand.

The door to the living room creaks open. But there’s no one there. Just an open doorway, leading into the dark hallway.

The coldness in the room intensifies. The air feels thick, like something is trying to push its way inside.

We sit there, staring at the open doorway, waiting for something to move in the dark. The footsteps have stopped, but the tension hasn’t. The room is freezing now, and I can see my breath in front of me. Emma is shaking, her fingers digging into the worn fabric of her rabbit.

I glance at Dad, his eyes fixed on the doorway, his jaw clenched so tight that I’m afraid he might snap. Mom hasn’t moved an inch. I want to ask her what’s happening, why things feel different tonight, but I know better. The rules don’t allow for questions.

Then, a sound breaks the silence. It’s faint, like a whisper carried on the wind. I can’t make out the words, but I know it isn’t good. The voices, whatever they are, are back. I know from experience that you don’t want to hear what they have to say.

Mom tenses, her eyes wide. She’s heard it too. Dad slowly shakes his head, as if telling us to ignore it, to stay quiet. We’ve been through this before. We know the drill.

But something feels wrong tonight. The air is heavier than usual, the shadows in the hallway darker. It’s like the house itself is changing, warping. I feel a knot of fear twist in my stomach.

The timer on the kitchen counter ticks loudly, counting down the seconds until we’re free. But it feels like an eternity away. I can barely stand the tension anymore, and I’m not sure how much longer Emma can hold out.

Suddenly, there’s another noise. This time, it’s a low scraping sound, like something being dragged across the floor. It’s coming from upstairs again. My heart skips a beat. I don’t dare look at Emma. I know she’s barely holding it together.

The scraping sound stops, replaced by a soft knock on the wall. Three taps, slow and rhythmic. Then another three taps, a little louder this time. It’s coming closer, moving down the stairs.

Mom’s breathing grows rapid, her eyes darting toward Dad. But Dad doesn’t move. His hands grip the armrest of his chair so tightly that his knuckles turn white. He’s afraid too, but he’s trying to hide it. It isn’t working.

Then, without warning, Emma stands up. My heart leaps into my throat. She drops the rabbit on the floor, her small body trembling as she takes a step toward the hallway. “Emma!” I want to shout, but I can’t. I bite my lip so hard I taste blood.

She’s sleepwalking. She does this sometimes, but not like this, not during the game.

Mom moves to stop her, but Dad holds up his hand, stopping her in her tracks. His eyes are wide, and there’s something in his expression that sends a chill down my spine. He’s not stopping Emma. He’s letting her go.

I don’t understand. Why isn’t he stopping her?

Emma takes another step toward the dark hallway, her eyes half-closed. She’s not awake. She doesn’t know what she’s doing. The shadows in the hallway seem to shift, reaching out for her. My heart is pounding in my ears, and I want to scream, but I can’t.

Just as Emma reaches the threshold of the door, something happens. The scraping sound returns, but this time it’s fast and frantic. It rushes toward us, and Emma freezes, her tiny frame standing at the edge of the darkness.

The whispers grow louder, more insistent. They seem to wrap around her, calling her name.

Mom can’t take it anymore. She jumps up, rushing toward Emma, but Dad grabs her arm, pulling her back with a strength I didn’t know he had. “No,” he whispers, his voice strained. “Let her go.”

Let her go? The words don’t make sense. What is he doing? Why is he letting her walk into the dark?

Emma takes one more step, and suddenly, the door to the hallway slams shut. The whole house shakes, and the lights flicker. The cold air vanishes in an instant, replaced by a suffocating stillness.

The timer rings, breaking the silence. The game is over.

But Emma, Emma’s gone.

The timer rang, signaling the end of the game, but my sister had vanished, taken into the darkness beyond the door. My mind raced, trying to make sense of what had just happened.

I turned to my parents, expecting them to react, to rush toward the door, to find Emma. But they sat there, frozen, their faces pale, eyes wide with that same deep-rooted terror I’d seen before. It was as if they were waiting for something.

""Where is she?"" I whispered, my voice trembling. ""Why aren’t you doing anything?""

Mom finally moved, slowly shaking her head. “We can’t,” she said softly, her voice barely audible. “The game is over.”

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Emma was gone, and they were just sitting there. I stood up, my body shaking with fear and anger. “We have to find her!” I shouted, louder than I should have, but I didn’t care anymore. “My little sister is out there!”

Dad’s voice was firm when he spoke, though his eyes betrayed his fear. “It’s too late,” he said. “The game has its rules.”

“Rules?” I repeated, incredulous. “What about Emma? We can’t just leave her!”

“We can’t go after her,” Mom said, her eyes filling with tears. “Not now.”

The fear in their eyes, the trembling in their voices … it wasn’t just fear of losing Emma. It was something else, something much worse. They knew something I didn’t, something they weren’t telling me.

I couldn’t stand it anymore. I ran toward the door, throwing it open and stepping into the hallway. The air was colder, denser, as if the house itself had changed. The shadows seemed darker, thicker. I called out for Emma, but there was no answer.

As I crept through the hallway, my footsteps echoed unnervingly. The house felt larger, more expansive than before, the walls stretching out into places that hadn’t existed before. It was like the game had taken over completely, twisting the space around me.

Then I heard it, a faint sound, almost like a sob. It was coming from upstairs.

Without thinking, I rushed toward the stairs, my heart racing. I had to find her. I had to bring her back. Each step creaked under my weight, the air growing colder with every breath I took. I reached the top of the stairs and paused, listening. The sound was closer now. It was Emma. I was sure of it.

I followed the sound down the hallway toward her bedroom door. It was cracked open, just a sliver of light spilling out. I pushed it open slowly, stepping inside.

And then I saw her.

Emma stood in the center of the room, her back to me. Her rabbit lay discarded on the floor, and she was whispering something, too low for me to make out. Relief flooded through me. She was here. She was safe.

“Emma?” I called softly, stepping closer.

She didn’t respond. She just kept whispering, her voice steady and calm. I moved closer, but something felt wrong. The air in the room was thick with tension, and the shadows along the walls seemed to pulse as if alive.

“Emma?” I said again, louder this time.

She stopped whispering. Slowly, she turned to face me.

What I saw made my blood run cold.

It was Emma, but something was different. Her eyes were vacant, distant, like she was somewhere far away. Her skin was pale, almost translucent in the dim light. Then I saw it, a faint line across her neck, as if something had gently traced the same cold cut I had felt years ago.

“Emma?” I took a step back, my heart pounding in my chest.

She smiled, a small, eerie smile that didn’t reach her eyes. “You should’ve stayed quiet,” she said softly.

Before I could react, the door behind me slammed shut, trapping us in the room. The temperature dropped instantly, and the whispers I had heard earlier began again, surrounding me. They were louder now, coming from everywhere at once.

I turned to the door, trying to open it, but it wouldn’t budge. I was stuck, and the shadows on the walls began to move, creeping toward me. Emma stood still, watching me with that unnerving smile on her face.

“They’re here,” she whispered. “They want to play.”

The shadows inched closer, their forms shifting, becoming more solid. They moved toward me slowly, deliberately, as if savoring the moment.

I pressed myself against the door, panic surging through me. “Emma, please,” I begged. “We have to get out of here.”

But Emma just shook her head, that same empty smile on her face. “It’s too late,” she said. “The game is never really over.”

The shadows were almost upon me, their cold presence wrapping around me like a vice. My skin prickled, the same sensation I had felt years ago, the invisible fingers tracing across my neck. I was trapped, and I knew that if I made a sound, it would all be over.

Then, I heard a loud crash from downstairs. My parents had finally moved.

“Emma!” Mom screamed from the bottom of the stairs. Her voice broke through the eerie silence in the room. I took the opportunity to shove past Emma, running toward the door. I slammed my shoulder against it, and it finally gave way.

I rushed down the stairs, my legs trembling as I reached the bottom. My parents were standing there, wide-eyed and terrified. Behind them, the shadows continued to grow, spilling down the stairs like a dark fog, creeping toward us.

“We have to leave!” I shouted, grabbing my mom’s hand. But she didn’t move.

“We can’t leave the house,” Dad said, his voice hollow. “If we leave, they’ll follow us.”

“We don’t have a choice!” I shot back, glancing up at the stairs. The shadows were almost upon us, and I could hear Emma’s footsteps echoing from the hallway above.

Dad shook his head slowly. “This is our fault. We broke the rules.”

“What?” I stared at him, confused. “What are you talking about?”

Mom’s face was pale, her eyes filled with tears. “It’s true,” she whispered. “We broke the rules years ago. Before you were born. We didn’t know what we were doing, and ever since, the game has been watching us.”

The room felt like it was closing in around me. “So, what? We’re supposed to stay here and let them take us?”

Dad didn’t answer. He just stared at the shadows creeping down the stairs. “Go,” he said quietly. “You and Emma. Get out of here. Don’t come back.”

Tears welled up in my eyes, but I nodded. There was no time to argue. I ran back upstairs, finding Emma standing at the top, her face pale, her eyes blank.

“Come on!” I shouted, grabbing her hand. For a moment, she didn’t move, but then something in her eyes shifted. She blinked, as if waking from a dream, and nodded.

We ran down the stairs together, the shadows chasing us as we sprinted toward the front door. I could hear Mom crying behind us, and I forced myself not to look back.

The moment we stepped outside, the cold air hit us like a wave. The house groaned behind us, the door slamming shut. I grabbed Emma, pulling her away from the house as fast as I could.

We ran down the street, not stopping until we reached the edge of the yard. I turned back, my heart pounding in my chest.

The house was dark and silent, its windows empty and lifeless. But I knew better. I knew that inside, the game was still playing.

My parents had stayed behind, victims of a game they had accidentally started long ago. And now, the game would never end for them.

I looked down at Emma, who was trembling beside me. “We made it,” I whispered, trying to reassure her. But I knew the truth. We hadn’t really escaped. The game would follow us, always waiting for the next time we made a mistake.

As we walked away from the house, I could still hear it in the back of my mind, the soft ticking of the timer, counting down [once again](https://www.youtube.com/@HerScreams).",275,0.94,14,HerScreams,2024-11-10 08:12:35,1go1ie8,289,High
NoSleep,"For Those About To Rock, Burn Some Sage First","The thing nobody gets right about the Satanic panic is that there were two phases. First Wave Dirtbags, (1978 to 1985) were victims of the panic. They never actually messed with the occult. Black Sabbath records, role playing games, and cutting gym class did not make you a  wizard. Second Wave Dirtbags (1985 to 1992) however…we were created by the panic. 

We heard that heavy metal and D&D led to black magic. We couldn’t wait to sign up.


Of course we got into Satanism. For like a week.


Then we found a copy of The Magus at Waldenbooks in the mall. Followed by someone’s older brother telling us why Jimmy Page bought Boleskine House, and suddenly kids who couldn’t pass freshman English were trying to decipher Aleister Crowley.


Magick is an oral tradition. We heard about Robert Anton Wilson from the weirdos at the record shop and Austin Osman Spare from the hippies who sold crystals in the flea market. 


We were in our senior year when we heard about The Chattering Storm.


By that time my core crew was Inga, Dizz, Richard, and me. Inga got hired at the hippy shop and we would hang out there and visit her. That was how we heard about the Storm, from Creepy Craig, one of the regulars.   


Craig was maybe 30, and way too excited to hang out with high schoolers. Anyway, he told us about the game, and when we were interested, he wrote down the directions. With his off-kilter block letters, the instructions looked like a ransom note written by a third grader.


Saturday nights were always a sleep over at Dizz’s house. His parents weren’t big on rules, and we were able to keep all of our band’s gear in the basement, which became our rehearsal room/clubhouse/occult science lab. Scattered among Richard’s drums and Inga’s and my amps were the remains of dozens of seances, rituals, and ouija board sessions. Candles, sigils, and beer cans littered the place.


We weren’t doing any of it with any real intention other than trying to scare ourselves. We fell asleep to slasher movies and woke up to Slayer, so that was increasingly hard to do.


The night that we summoned the Chattering Storm was the middle of January. There wasn’t much else going on. Creepy Craig’s directions were detailed. Too detailed. There was no way we were doing all these steps.


The entire first paragraph was rules. Burn sage in all four corners of the room. Pass. Draw two protective circles, one salt, one ash. No thank you. Red, yellow, blue and white candles burning in the four sacred directions. Nope.


The thing is, we had the stupid candles. But the thing about dirtbags (or heads, heshers, burnouts, depending on your region) is… if we wanted rules, we would have played a sport. 


The one rule we followed was the music. The game needed instrumental music. We argued over whether to use Orion by Metallica or Transylvania by Iron Maiden. We settled on playing a demo of one of our (very long) original songs. I was not thrilled with this choice, as I secretly thought that the only thing our band had going for it was Inga’s lyrics. 


Dizz went first, sitting in a chair in the middle of the room, blindfolded. The rest of us sat in a semicircle around him. Dizz did the singing chant, pitching his voice twice low, once high, then low again. We recited the same four words over and over. They looked vaguely Scandinavian written down, but spoken they sounded like speaking backwards.


According to Creepy Craig (and confirmed by some of the crystal shoppers) this should lead to the person in the chair automatically speaking in tongues… demonic gibberish that should last 30 seconds, tops.


That is not what happened.


Dizz’s voice was still his, but it was like he found a different gear in his vocal cords. The first few words were gibberish, but then in a clear, over enunciated voice like an old time radio announcer he said “THE REAL REASON RICHARD CANT HANG OUT ON MONDAYS IS BECAUSE HE GOES TO THE CHURCH YOUTH GROUP…HE CONFESSES ABOUT THE STUFF HE STEALS, INCLUDING MY LANDSCAPING MONEY AND INGA’S DELAY PEDAL…”


We were supposed to keep chanting the whole time, but we sat there with our mouths open. By the time I finally got up and paused the stereo Dizz had moved on to what Inga did at camp. As soon as the music stopped Dizz was back to normal.


Nobody was mad at him. We all just knew that was not him talking. We continued, like idiots.


I went next. Same thing: chair, blindfold, chanting.


Then I went away.


Where my mind used to be was a torrent of pure information. I could see my friends. Not just them, but their secrets, their histories… the real them, not who they presented to me. I knew i was talking but I also knew it wasn’t me. I was part of something else, and it was delicious.


Inga went next, and the storm sounded different through her. Her voice was high and clear, like a song. I don’t remember what she said, I only know that it was cruel, and beautiful, and for those few minutes I was in terrified of her. That face that I had known since first grade and had a tiny crush on since fifth grade was unrecognizable… the set of her jaw, the way her lips moved… this wasn’t Inga.


Whatever she said broke Richard. He ran out of the room and out of our lives. He never spoke to any of us again. 


Monday morning I had an oral report in Spanish class. Normally I would blow it off, but I was trying to graduate, so I put AC/DC in my Walkman and psyched myself up. 


I hate people looking at me. Which should have been a red flag considering i was planning on being a rock star. But I wasn’t big on thinking things through. 


As I stood up to face the class, the normal panic wasn’t there. In the back of my head the chords from Dirty Deeds kept playing. Something like adrenaline flooded my body and I felt…good? I didn’t have to think about the words, they just flowed out. 


In perfectly accented Spanish, I explained how Mexico is a country where they love soccer and boxing and dancing, and how our teacher recently relapsed after three years sober.


Lo siento, Senor Gottlieb. 

The adrenaline was gone and I was terrified. I tried to see my friends. I found Richard first, his locker was right by mine. He wouldn’t talk to me, the look on his face made my blood run cold. He was scared of me.


I saw Dizz in the cafeteria. He was not at the dirtbag table. Somehow he was the center of attention at the wrestling team table. Whatever he was saying must have been fascinating, where they were laughing and hanging on his every word. 


Seeing Dizz as the newly crowned jock mayor freaked me out more than getting possessed in Spanish. 


I headed for the girls gym, it was fifth period, so Inga should be there.  In the hallway two girls that were sure of in our social circle were beating the crap out of each other. Motley Crue t-shirts were torn, hair sprayed bangs were ripped. Inga was in the crowd, with a smile that I didn’t recognize.


My first thought was: she did this.


My next thought was: it did this.


A thought in a voice that wasn’t mine said: we did this.


I left school out the emergency door, my heart racing, and headed home. I could barely drive from the adrenaline shaking my hands. I was scared of my only friends. I was scared of how good I felt Saturday night. Most of all I was scared of how that voice started murmuring in my head the second I turned on the car stereo. It was like it was feeding off of the music. Or how the music made me feel.


Mom was in the kitchen when I got home, and it took all my willpower not to tell her all the dirty details that I suddenly knew about dad. The Storm wanted to be heard. I kept my head down and made it into my room. Barely. 

 I tried to clear my head with the only thing that ever worked. I plugged my guitar in and forced myself to practice scales for twenty minutes before opening up and improvising. 


My head didn’t clear. It filled up again. The Storm came calling again and suddenly I was in it.


I am Apollo, in Delphi they praise me and I give them music and prophecy.


I am Brigid, granting poetry to the Celts on the banks of the River Barrow. 


I am u/CQ-Erickson, five years from now, playing to a stadium of adoring fans. This is the future if I just relax and…


No.


Trying to snap out of it was like a combination of sleep paralysis and amnesia. My mind didn’t  want to remember who I am… finally one last burst of sheer panic jolted my body and I shook it out of my mind. I forced myself to remember: I am not a god. Gods don’t have back acne. I am a 17 year old dirtbag who will be taking Spanish in summer school. 


I never picked up my guitar again.


It probably looked, from the outside, like we just drifted apart over the next few months before graduation. It wasn’t gradual on my part. I loved my friends, but I didn’t recognize them. The look in Dizz’s eyes scared the hell out of me. The look in Inga’s eyes broke my heart.

Richard never spoke with us again. I think he is a priest now. Dizz started a conspiracy theory show on public access television when he was 18. I watched it once. It wasn’t his voice. It was the storm. I assume it still is, but I can’t bring myself to listen, even though he is tough to avoid these days.


Inga never played stadiums but she sold her first song right after high school and hasn’t stopped quietly working in the industry since. She has a place in Malibu on the cliffs.


I’ve never heard her songs. Or anyone else’s. 


That is what it cost me. Not only my friends, but music. All of it. I won’t turn on a radio; even now. I won’t risk opening myself up to that feeling again. Ever. I listen to audiobooks in the car.


It isn’t just the Satanic Panic that people get wrong. Actual deals with the devil aren’t what they tell us. You don’t lose your soul when you die. You lose it once you are willing to lose it. That person playing the stadium would look like me, but I would be gone. Like my friends. Lost in the Chattering Storm.

NoSleep,My Uncle Matt Never Existed,"My family and I have been going through a very strange experience over the last couple of months. It's hard to even put into words or explain *what* is going on. I guess I can just start off from where it all started to feel off. 



A few months back my family had a big get-together. My parents both have two siblings. They all got married and had some kids. Well, all of them except Uncle Matt. He never got married or had kids. That means I have ten cousins. My aunts and uncles all live within two hours of us so we’ve all grown up together. 



That being said, we don't normally have all my aunts and uncles in a house at once, this was a rare occasion to have a family meal when they were all free.



I will not be naming every single family member in this post because that seems like a lot of information and honestly, you've already gotten more information about my family than you ever wanted, but I promise this context is important. 



Okay, enough with my babbling. Let's talk about what happened that weird night. 



My parents and I went over to my Aunt Margo and Uncle Ken’s house for a BBQ in the backyard. The backyard felt loud and chaotic. I tried to stay out of the way and get the night over with. I was honestly just there for the free food.



We were all sitting down at a big table outside. I was so focused on making sure none of the napkins went flying in the wind I wasn't listening to the conversation. My aunt Margo came over to the table with a plate of really burnt hot dogs. My mom immediately started to laugh at the sight of them.



“Is burning food genetic or something? How on earth do you guys always do that to food? The Jensens need to leave the cooking to the Millers.” My mom said with a sarcastic giggle. Uncle Ken looked at her confused. 



“What are you on about Liz? Uncle Ken snapped back.



“I mean, Margo burnt the hot dogs and Matt always burns food when he cooks. Remember we had to ban him for months from cooking because we had to order takeout like three times in a row.” Everyone at the table laughed recalling their memories. Sighs of recollection bounced back and forth from person to person when my dad spoke up in Aunt Margos' defense. 



“Honey, what are you talking about? Matt is your brother. I really shouldn't have to remind you of that.” My mom rolled her eyes in response to my dad.



I spoke up because I was suddenly confused about which side of the family Uncle Matt was actually on. You would think I would naturally just know that, but all my aunts and uncles act like siblings and call each other their siblings. My grandparents often refer to their son/daughter-in-laws as just their kids so it isn't something I always think about.



“Wait, I'm confused. Whose side is Uncle Matt on? What is the joke? I don't get it.” I asked but was only met with a laugh from all the parents at the table. I finally got an answer from my mom following the silence of the joke that somehow went over my head.



“Don't be silly baby, Matt is your dad's brother.” As the words left her mouth half the table looked confused. 



“Liz, what are you talking about? He is on your side. He is a Miller.” My aunt Margo said as she scraped off the burnt edges of her hot dog. 



“Okay, Now I’m with Amanda. I don't get the joke.” My mom said while looking at me with narrow inquisitive eyes and then at the rest of the group. 



“Wait, wait, everyone slow down.” Aunt June said, speaking up for probably the first time in the night. “This is dumb. Matt is not Liz and I’s brother. He has to be on the Jensen's side of the family.” 



I sat at the table watching my family in silence. Their eyes darted back and forth. They stopped laughing and were all just scratching their heads. 



After a few minutes, my mom got out her phone. She found an old family photo from when she was a kid. In the photo were her, my grandparents, my uncle Paul, and my aunt June. Nothing out of the ordinary. After looking at the picture, Aunt Margo got out *her* phone and looked for an old childhood photo. 



“Ah ha! Found one.” She stated as she showed off the photo on her phone. Yet again, the photo was normal. It had my grandparents, my dad, Aunt Margo, and Aunt Susan. 



The next hour consisted of both sides of the family going back and forth showing photos. None of them with Uncle Matt in them.



I had a few of my cousins there, but they all lost interest once they ate. I on the other hand couldn't be pulled away. I was engrossed in learning where the heck Uncle Matt came from. 



They kept talking back and forth. They figured maybe he wasn't anyone's sibling. Maybe he was related by marriage or a second cousin twice removed that I just called ‘Uncle Matt’ because that was the easiest thing to call him. We all have a relative like that, right?  



I know an easy solution you might be thinking of is to just call him up. That's also what I said but he was working and they didn't want to interrupt him, but guess what? I needed answers so I decided to call him. However, when I looked at my phone I couldn't find him In my contacts. I looked through it multiple times. I remembered texting him about something a few days back so he should’ve been in my text history. Still nothing. 



After being weirded out by his contact being gone, I mentioned out loud that someone should call him. Regardless of him being at work. No one agreed with me, but once I told them his contact was missing from my phone they all got curious and looked to see if he was missing for them too. 



We were all in shock to find him missing from all our phones. 



The family started to dig through their camera rolls and any digital libraries they had to try and find any photo of him. Uncle Andrew thought he had a photo of the back of him, but we soon found that we all remembered him looking differently. 



Uncle Andrew showed a picture of the back of a bald man who looked pretty tall. Aunt June called him crazy and recalled him having long curly red hair. 



It wasn’t like we hadn’t seen him in a year or that he was some kind of distant memory. I saw the guy last week. He came over to my house to help me with some homework, and I can tell you he didn’t have red hair or no hair at all, he was, well, shoot... I can’t remember what he looked like now that I think about it. 



It was safe to say we were all creeped out. As the sun went down and it got chilly out, the group moved inside. Normally, this is when everyone would go home, but I saw Aunt Margo start a pot of coffee. It was going to be a long night. The air was tense and full of unease. None of the adults wanted to go home until they had answers. 



I could tell the adults wanted to talk more but didn’t want to worry the younger cousins. My older cousin Maddy clearly didn’t care about anything that was going on. She just wanted to sleep. We convinced her to take my three young cousins into the basement so they could all get some sleep. But not me, I was invested. Uncle Matt and I are close. We see each other all the time. How could I not have a shred of evidence that he even existed? 



As my cousins shuffled downstairs, all the adults huddled around a big whiteboard Aunt Margo slapped on the kitchen island. They started to write down everything they could remember. What he looked like, the last time they saw him, memories of him. None of it was coherent. It seemed he was a completely different person in all our memories. Even if it was a memory where multiple people were around. 



One of the only things that we could all agree on was that the Jensens always thought he was on the Miller side of the family and the Millers always thought he was on the Jensen side. 



My Mom recalled a story of Matt and my dad going to a lake to fish, but the hook got stuck on Matt’s hat and went flying. My dad told us he remembered my mom telling him the same exact story many times. 



Everyone had memories of stories where he was on the other side of the family. 



Soon everyone was on the phone with a new family member trying to tell them the situation and asking what they thought about everything. My aunts and uncles were talking to realities on the phone I didn’t know I had. Relatives that probably only met Matt a couple times at best. All I heard was one dead end at a time. No one knew where he came from or where he went.



So the big question was *who is Matt?* Was he just some random guy who weaseled his way into the family? Telling one side of the family one thing and the other side another? Or was it something *so* much worse? 



As the sun came up that Saturday morning we were all still scratching our heads. The deeper we got into who Matt was, the more freaked out everyone got. I was honestly surprised they let me stay with them all night long. 



The more digging everyone did, the farther away we felt. The more rabbit holes we went down the less real he seemed. We couldn’t find any evidence that he ever existed. Some of us searched all over the internet for ‘Matt Jensen’, or ‘Matt Miller’ and a few of us searched for other last names in the family. Of course, it was kind of hard to know who we were looking for given we didn’t know what he *really* looked like. 



After hours of discussion, we compiled a list of attributes that never wavered about Uncle Matt. 



He was a man, he never had a mustache, he was tall, he was bad at math, and he loved Jim Carrey movies. 



That might seem like a random grouping of facts, but that's because it was. We couldn’t even remember where his house was. Some of us completely forgot and others remembered different houses. It didn’t matter. We weren’t going to start knocking on doors to find a man we were concerned never existed. 



We started to believe that as soon as we began to question who he was he just simply started to fade away into nothingness. Like it was some kind of self-destructive on his own consciousness. 



It was around 9 a.m. that morning when people started to fall asleep on couches. The night before started with everyone being determined and saying the night wouldn’t end until we found Uncle Matt, but here we all were. Exhausted and with little to no answers. It felt like accepting defeat by napping on the couch but we couldn’t do much else. 



At 11 a.m. we all woke up to the sound of my cousins playing in the next room over. We all sat up and rubbed our eyes. You could practically see the gears turning in everyone’s heads as they woke up from their stupors. I could tell when they realized their memories actually happened and it wasn’t just a weird fever dream. 



My Aunt Margo stumbled to the kitchen while yawning and started to dig in the pantry for something substantial the kids could all eat. It was clear they had alrighty raided the cookie stash. 



As the adults had a quiet conversation we heard something come from my Cousin Kass that made us freeze. 



“Yeah, remember last night when Uncle Matt gave us all those cookies! It was so much fun!” My small cousin said with a hop and a skip. 



“Wait Kass, get over here and say that again.” My uncle Andrew yelled in an attempt to sound intimidating but came out with a voice crack. 



Kass walked over to us looking like a confused puppy who just got yelled at. 



“What did I do wrong Uncle Andrew? I thought if Uncle Matt offered us cookies I could have them?”



“Kass, you are not in trouble. This is very important…are you telling me Uncle Matt was with you guys last night?” Uncle Andrew tried to say in a gentle tone to not scare Kass. 



“I mean, not the whole night but he brought us all cookies and put a movie on for us. Then he said he wanted to go hang out with you guys upstairs.” Kass told us with a quiet voice. 



Everyone started to frantically look around the room. Looking for any evidence of him being there last night. We quickly asked the rest of the cousins if they saw Matt and some kids did and some didn’t.  



I noticed something when I started to count the objects in the room. There were ten adults and me upstairs last night. So, there should've been eleven people in total, but I saw twelve plates out with the leftover crumbs from our late-night pizza, twelve spots laid out for sleeping in the living room, and twelve mugs or cups of coffee. 



He was here last night. 



As I mentioned what I found, my dad said he remembered seeing him last night. He said Matt brought him some water. Uncle Paul said he saw him go to the bathroom but couldn’t remember him coming out. 



They mentioned how it felt like it never actually happened but he managed to place the memory in them after the fact. How else would they see Uncle Matt right in front of them and not realize what was happening?



I had a strange feeling that started to bubble up. I felt uneasy and restless. 



“Wait, something is off here,” I said loudly to the room. “Everyone line up on the wall, I want to try something.” 



For a second they all looked at me confused. They normally wouldn’t let me boss them around like that, but they were desperate and tired. 



All the adults lined up against the wall. As I walked by then I counted out loud. Something strange happened. I counted twelve people including me. None of the kids were lined up. I wasn’t counting myself twice. There was an extra person. Uncle Matt wasn’t just here last night. He was with us in the room at that moment. 



Other members of the family even tried to count. We did it over and over again. Even adding one of the kids to the mix, but every single time there was one extra person, but we still couldn’t see him? How was he hiding in plain sight? 



Everyone ended up leaving my Aunt Margo’s house that afternoon. We were all still extremely creeped out about the whole thing, but what could we do about it? Not much. It’s not like Uncle Matt ever did anything violent. Mostly normal behavior except for a few memories of him that were kinda weird. One of us remembered seeing him in the kitchen, stacking and unstacking bowls for hours. Another person remembered him once packing for a vacation but his suitcase only had trash bags in it. And I have a memory of us sitting in front of a fireplace with him reading the instruction manual to a blender for a bedtime story. 



At least those were the kind of memories we had in the beginning. As the weeks went on, we started to remember things that got more and more concerning. He showed up in our houses in the middle of the night. Or buying us all hammers for Christmas. He once bought hundreds of dollars worth of knives and put them in my Dad’s car. 



Once we developed disturbing memories of him, we tried to tell the police. Of course, they couldn’t find any evidence of his existence so they couldn’t help us. It didn’t help our case that we couldn’t even give them a last name. How on earth are they supposed to find a guy based on his name being Matt and no physical features



So who is Uncle Matt? I can say with one hundred percent certainty, I have no clue. Is he a man? Is he an entity? Is he a figment of our imaginations? Or is he nothing at all? I don’t know. And that’s the worst part of all. He seems to always be around at family dinners. Most of the time I count the number of people I end up with an extra person. 

  
He feels like a virus. Always implanting a memory of himself being around but in the moment I never see him.  



It seems to be a family joke at this point. Always leaving out an extra plate for him or something. In my opinion, no one is taking this situation seriously. I know he hasn’t hurt anyone, but why should we wait for something to happen? I swear I can *feel* it when he shows up. The hairs on the back of my neck stand up. My family has given up on trying to figure out who or *what* Uncle Matt is. But I haven’t. 



It feels like they have all just forgotten the disturbing memories of him. I swear the deeper I dig to find him, the worse the memories get. Like he is rotting and festering in my memories. Right before my eyes. I'm starting to think it's his attempt to stop me from looking for him. The fact that he is punishing me for looking for him makes my concern grow more and more. Why is he suddenly running now that I am on to him? Why is he so afraid of me finding him? And what will happen once I do find him?



I will find you, Uncle Matt. I will find out *what* you are.",1766,0.99,70,bohemiancouchpotato,2024-11-09 18:50:45,1gnon8g,1836,High
NoSleep,There Was Something Playing My Theremin,"The first time I heard it, I was just practicing. Just doing my usual thing—hand up, hand down, keeping my movements soft, careful, letting the sound drift out like silk. The theremin’s tone is so fragile, like a breath that could stop at any moment if you’re not gentle with it. That's what I loved about it, I think. It was just me and the air, and the tiny vibrations between us. No one to see, no one to judge.

I was alone in my practice spot, this clearing out in the trees. It was quiet, with sunlight slipping through the branches, turning the dust into tiny golden stars. The first notes floated up, high and thin, and I started to feel that warmth inside, the one that made me feel like maybe I was safe, even here in these woods, even with all the other campers wandering around.

But then—no, this sounds ridiculous I'd say—then I thought I heard something. Just… a whisper, faint and shivering, almost like it was hiding behind the music.

I lowered my hand, the note slipping away, and listened. Nothing but the wind stirring through the pines, and yet I felt something…not so much watching as listening. I took a deep breath, told myself to shake it off. Still, I kept glancing over my shoulder the whole way back to camp.

That night, I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, my nerves buzzing. I couldn’t stop thinking about the whisper, replaying it in my mind even though it was just a sound, barely even there. I’d convinced myself it was all in my head until Sam leaned over her bunk and asked, “You heard it, didn’t you?”

I turned, and she was looking at me with this weird little smile, like she knew exactly what I’d been thinking about. “Heard what?” I mumbled.

“The Weaver.” Her voice was just a whisper. “Everyone knows about it. The Weaver’s… a thing that lives in the forest, a kind of creature, or maybe a spirit, no one knows for sure. It’s supposed to prey on people like us—on musicians. Especially musicians with… well, you know. Secrets.”

She didn’t know about my secrets, of course, but I felt a chill slip over me anyway. “What… what does it do?”

She leaned in closer, her eyes wide. “It can take on any shape, any form, anything you’re afraid of. And if it finds you, if it latches onto you… it starts to play *you*. Your fears, your thoughts, your music. It turns it all into its song, and you can’t do anything but listen as it twists you into… whatever it wants.” She sat back, smirking, like it was just another campfire story.

But I didn’t sleep that night. The idea of something that could twist my music, make it into something I’d never choose, something that wasn’t me—I hated it. And worse, I couldn’t help feeling like Sam had been right, like the Weaver had already noticed me. Like it had already begun.

The next day, everything felt… wrong. The sunlight was too bright, the forest too still. My theremin, normally my only source of comfort, felt heavy in my hands, and my music… my music didn’t sound like mine anymore. Each note came out different than I wanted, the sounds drifting into strange, unsettling tones, like they were being stretched and pulled by something invisible. And the whispers—they were back, too, sliding between the notes, too faint for anyone else to hear.

I told myself it was just nerves, just my stupid imagination. But then I heard it: my name.

*Amelia.*

My blood ran cold. The voice was soft, distant, like it had been carried on the wind, but I knew it was real. I knew it was calling me.

That night, I lay in bed, too scared to close my eyes. But the whispers came anyway, slipping into my thoughts like they’d waited for me. And then, faintly, I heard my theremin. A single note, low and eerie, drifting through the cabin like a dark lullaby. My heart pounded, and I squeezed my eyes shut, but the music grew louder, twisting itself into something awful, something wrong.

It was my music, but it wasn’t. The notes coiled and warped, bending into a melody I’d never played. A horrible, hollow feeling washed over me, as though the Weaver was reaching inside, taking my hands, making me play its song. I tried to move, to scream, but my body wouldn’t obey.

It was as if I’d become an instrument myself.

The Weaver’s instrument.

And as the music wrapped around me, filling me with dread, I felt myself slipping, like I was being pulled into the sound, becoming part of it, disappearing into its song.

I thought maybe it was just me. The whispers, the eerie twists in my music, that creeping feeling of something watching. But by the third day, it was clear I wasn’t the only one. Strange things were happening all around camp, things no one could explain.

First, there was Ethan, the cellist, normally so calm and unflappable. He’d been fine that morning, practicing in the open field by the lake. But when he came back to the cabin after lunch, he looked pale, his hands shaking as he set down his cello. He tried to play through it, but his fingers stumbled, scratching out sour notes, as if something in his music had gone wrong. Later, I heard him mumbling to himself in the cabin, words I couldn’t make out, like he was arguing with someone who wasn’t there.

Then, one of the flute players, Sarah, had a breakdown during a rehearsal. She’d played fine—beautifully, even—but suddenly she just stopped, her eyes wide and unfocused, clutching her flute like it was the only thing keeping her safe. She claimed she’d seen someone in the woods watching her, someone that looked exactly like her, only with hollow, empty eyes. By the time the counselors reached her, she was sobbing, completely inconsolable.

The Weaver had started weaving its web.

I tried not to think about Sam’s story, the one about the Weaver preying on musicians with 'secrets'. But the more I saw, the harder it became to ignore. It was like the whole camp had fallen under a spell. Each day, someone else would drift off, or stumble back from their practice spot looking dazed, hollow, like they’d left something behind in the woods that they couldn’t get back.

And at night, the whispers grew louder.

Every time I closed my eyes, I heard it—the faint, taunting hum of my theremin. Notes I didn’t remember playing echoed in my mind, low and twisted, wrapping around my thoughts like spider silk. My dreams were filled with shadows, each one tugging at my hands, pulling at my voice, trapping me in endless, dark corridors filled with music I didn’t recognize as my own.

By the fifth day, I couldn’t even bring myself to practice. I stayed in my cabin, but even there, I could feel the Weaver’s presence. It had found its way into our minds, spinning webs made of our fears and memories, as though each of us were an instrument for it to pluck and pull.

There was that night, Sam woke up screaming, gasping for breath like she’d been drowning. “It… it was here,” she whispered, her face ashen. “I saw it. It took my face, Amelia. It looked just like me.”

None of us could sleep after that.

Later that night, I found Sam sitting by herself near the fire pit, her face pale and drawn. She hadn’t spoken much about the whispers, but I could see the strain in her eyes, the way she avoided making eye contact with anyone.

I sat next to her, uncertain of what to say, but something in me pushed past the fear. “Sam?” I asked softly. “You don’t have to hide it, you know. I’m… I’m scared too.”

Her eyes flickered up at me, and I saw something raw there—a vulnerability, like she had been carrying it all alone. “I didn’t want to tell anyone,” she whispered, voice cracking. “I thought if I did, it would just make it worse. But… I hear the music, Amelia. I hear it, and I feel like I’m losing myself. Like I’m becoming a part of it.”

I felt my heart ache for her. I understood that fear more than she knew. That fear of being consumed by something you couldn’t control, something that played with your mind until you couldn’t tell what was real anymore. I put a hand on her shoulder, my own voice trembling. “You’re not alone, Sam. We can face it together. All of us.”

Over the next few days, I saw the same fear in the faces of other campers, the quiet ones who kept to themselves. Slowly, they began to open up. And each time they did, I realized how much I had in common with them—the same vulnerability, the same fear, the same dread of being controlled, manipulated by something we couldn’t understand.

Together, we started talking more, sharing our experiences. Some of the others had heard the music, too. Some had felt the shadows closing in. One girl, Eliza, spoke about the feeling of being watched while playing her flute, and how every note felt like it was being pulled out of her, twisted in the air before it could reach its proper pitch. Another camper, Marcus, said he’d seen the shadows follow him, the way they slipped behind trees, always lurking just out of sight.

I listened, I absorbed, and for the first time since arriving, I felt a flicker of strength deep inside me. These were my people. We weren’t alone in this. There was something in the way they shared their fears that made them all seem less like victims, and more like fighters. And I knew that I had to do everything in my power to help them fight back against The Weaver.

When I finally spoke, my voice was steadier than I’d expected. “The Weaver, it’s controlling us, manipulating us. But it only has power because we’re afraid. We have to face it, together. We can’t let it win.”

The group rallied around me, and I saw a spark of hope in their eyes. My sensitivity, the very thing I had always viewed as a weakness, had become a bridge—connecting me to them, and them to each other. It wasn’t just fear we were sharing. It was strength. It was understanding. We were all in this fight together.

Then that moment sorta leaked away, and the reality of our daily nightmare rolled in. Where I'd felt strong and supported I suddenly felt alone and weak. Maybe this was just because I felt like I was reliving the helpless silence that I had suffered through when I was younger, my secret, or maybe it was the Weaver exploiting those feelings of helplessness. It felt like some kind of trap either way.

We were trapped, like flies caught in a web, held by invisible threads that tugged at us in the dead of night. The Weaver didn’t just watch us—it *played* us, each of us caught in its dark, twisted melody. And the more it pulled, the emptier we felt, as though something inside us was slipping away, being stolen note by note.

At one point I actually tried to tell myself I was imagining it, that it was just a story, but deep down, I knew the truth. The Weaver was no myth. It was real. And it was here, lurking in the shadows, taking pieces of each of us until there would be nothing left but silence.

I was shaking when I walked into the big counselor’s office. Everything in me wanted to turn back, to go back to the cabin and pretend that none of this was happening. But the silence—the way nobody would talk to the adults about the strange things happening around camp—reminded me too much of before. Of the times things had happened, and everyone had just… kept quiet about it.

The counselor looked up, a little surprised to see me. “Amelia? What’s going on?” Her voice was calm, but I saw her eyes narrow a bit as I started to explain.

“It’s just that…” I hesitated, forcing myself to keep talking. “I keep hearing weird music. Not mine. It… it comes from somewhere else. And there are shadows that move when no one’s there. I feel like… like something’s watching us.”

She studied me, and for a brief second, I thought she might believe me. But her expression shifted, her brows knitting together like I was saying something embarrassing. “That’s… quite an imagination you have, Amelia. Why don’t we call your aunt? Maybe she’d like to come pick you up.”

“No! I’m not making this up!” My voice came out louder than I’d meant, and the surprise in her eyes twisted into something closer to pity. The look that told me she thought I was just a troubled kid, a problem to be solved by sending me home.

My stomach turned in knots. She didn’t believe me. Nobody ever did.

The big counselor went to the front of camp's office, to use the phone there, with her back to me. She was already dialing my aunt’s number, speaking in that soft, careful tone people use when they think you’re just overreacting. I could practically feel the walls closing in around me, the way they had before, the same way they did whenever people refused to see what was right in front of them.

""It's going to be okay, Amelia. This happens to a lot of new campers. It's her option to come get you if you're having a problem.""

Desperation clawed up my spine, and as her voice droned on into the phone, my eyes wandered to the bookshelf. That’s when I saw it—a small, leather-bound journal with “Camp Black Hollow – 1963” written on the cover. Something about it made my heart skip. Sam had mentioned a journal she’d seen once in the counselor’s office, one that held old, forgotten stories about the camp. Stories she’d overheard the counselor say shouldn’t be read by 'impressionable kids'.

Before I could second-guess myself, I slid over to the shelf, slipped the journal out, and tucked it under my sweater. I took a deep breath, steeling myself, and in one quick movement, I climbed out the open window and darted away from the office, my heart racing as I ran back to my cabin.

Inside, the world felt quiet again, but I couldn’t shake the pounding in my chest. I held the journal close, feeling its rough edges press into my hands. I could just leave. I could run from this, let my aunt come and pick me up, leave the other campers to… whatever this was.

But I knew what happened when I ignored the things that frightened me. I knew how silence and ignorance could allow an atrocity continue. I couldn’t leave Sam and the others alone with whatever was out there. Not if I could do something—anything—to stop it.

Hands trembling, I opened the journal. The pages were filled with spidery, slanted handwriting. My breath caught as I read the first few entries, which described strange dreams and music that echoed in the dark, voices that whispered in the trees. The final pages were even more frantic, describing a creature called the Weaver, a thing that preyed on musicians, wrapping its threads around their minds until they became something twisted, something broken.

*August 10th. There’s a talisman in the woods, hidden at the edge of the lake. They say it can repel the Weaver and seal its portal. I don’t know if I can find it, but I have to try. I can’t let it take any more of us.*

I felt a chill run down my spine as I closed the journal, gripping it tightly. I didn’t know if I could find this talisman, or if it was even real. But I knew one thing: I couldn’t just run away. I had to try.

Tomorrow, at dawn, I’d go to the lake.

I woke with a start, shivering in the cold. The cabin was still dark, and the air felt heavy, like the night was clinging to the walls, refusing to let go. I couldn't remember when I had fallen asleep, only that I hadn't slept well, not really. My head was a mess—thoughts and whispers all tangled together, so much uncertainty. The terror of what I had seen... what I had almost become... it still clung to me like a fog. I was shivering, but I wasn’t sure if it was from the cold or something deeper, something wrong inside me.

The faint light of dawn had barely broken through the windows, casting pale, fragmented patterns across the floor. I felt disconnected from myself, as if I were watching my own hands move as I dressed, each motion slow and deliberate, as if I could stop time if I willed it. The chill outside seemed to creep into my bones as I stepped out of the cabin, the cold air biting at my skin. The ground was damp from the night, but I barely felt the earth beneath me as I walked, my mind too focused on what I needed to do.

I had to find the talisman.

But as I stepped into the clearing, something felt off. Like I wasn’t entirely there. My body moved as if it had a mind of its own, and I was only an observer. Was I really awake? Was this real, or was I watching myself as I had watched myself fall into this nightmare?

I couldn’t tell anymore.

The camp around me was still mostly silent. The cabins were dark, the campers still asleep, unaware of what had happened the night before—or maybe they did, but they couldn’t bring themselves to speak of it. The darkness that hung over the camp, like a cloud, seemed to block out the early morning light, the patches of midnight lingering like black cobwebs in the corners of my mind. The air was thick with something I couldn’t explain, and it made my stomach churn.

I couldn’t stop. I had to keep going.

I pushed through the forest, each step slower than the last, until I reached the edge of the lake. The journal had said something about the talisman being near here, but how could I find it? What was I even looking for? A stone? A charm? The description was maddeningly vague. The earth felt cold beneath my feet, and the trees loomed over me like silent witnesses to the horrors I couldn’t escape.

The silence was suffocating. The only sound was the rustling of leaves in the breeze, and my breath—ragged, shallow—as I tried to make sense of everything. But there was no sense. I was grasping at shadows.

And then, I felt it.

The air grew thick, pressing against my skin, my chest tightening. A whisper, faint but unmistakable, like a breath in the dark.

“Amelia…”

I froze. The whisper was inside my head, too close to my ear, like it was coming from behind me. My heart began to pound as I turned, my eyes straining to find the source. But the forest was still, eerily so. No movement. No shape. No sound—except for the one that crept into my thoughts, slithering, growing louder.

“Amelia…” The voice was colder now, more insistent, as though it had been waiting for me. Waiting for me to hear it.

I could feel it. The Weaver.

It was watching me. Waiting. The very air seemed to twist around me, bending to its will. The shadows stretched out, shifting, pooling into shapes I couldn’t quite understand. I wanted to scream, but the words caught in my throat. My body was frozen, each movement sluggish, like the very forest was holding me in place.

And then, I heard my aunt’s voice—louder this time, sharp and real.

“Amelia!”

I snapped my head to the side, blinking, confused. She was there, standing just outside the clearing, her figure framed by the dim, early light. She was real. She was here.

“Amelia, come here! NOW!”

Her voice was cutting through the fog of terror, pulling me back. Without thinking, I turned and ran toward her, the fear still hot on my heels, but her voice was my anchor, pulling me away from the nightmare. The ground seemed to push against me as I ran, as if the earth itself was reluctant to let me go. The dark trees whispered, reaching for me, but I couldn’t stop. I couldn’t look back.

I stumbled into my aunt’s arms, and she wrapped them around me so tightly, I could hardly breathe, but it didn’t matter. I needed her. I needed her warmth. Her presence was the only thing that felt real anymore.

“Shh, it’s okay. You’re safe now,” she murmured, her voice steady, grounded. She didn’t ask me anything. She didn’t need to.

I couldn’t look at the camp again, couldn’t bear to think about it. The Weaver was still there. Still waiting for me to return, to fall into its grip again.

I let my aunt guide me away from the woods, away from the camp. The first light of dawn was creeping through the trees, but it didn’t feel like morning. It felt like the world was holding its breath, suspended between night and day, waiting for something terrible to happen. But I wasn’t going to let it.

I left everyone behind. I knew I had. Sam, Eliza, Marcus—they were still there, still in the grip of whatever had taken them. Whatever had almost taken me.

But I couldn’t go back. I couldn’t save them.

As the car pulled away, I looked out the window, my chest tight, knowing that something terrible was still out there, in the shadows, and I was leaving it behind.

But as my aunt squeezed my hand, I couldn’t shake the thought that I would be okay. For now.",16,0.88,1,dlschindler,2024-11-10 19:03:21,1gog3s8,17,High
NoSleep,Avoid the Northeast Kingdom,"My husband, David, and I were always avid campers. We were both always the outdoorsy types and felt most at home in the woods sitting by a campfire. Something about the peace of nature and silence of the forest would always put my mind at ease. However we could never find that peace at a state park or private campground. It just wasn’t the same as the primitive camping we enjoyed so much. We always picked up the best spots from locals and other primitive campers. There are so many beautiful views and peaceful sites that are hidden away. 

One such site we heard about was about 5 miles off of route 3 in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom. We heard stories about the mountain views and a peaceful lake that was one short hike away. We drove up to one of those dirt rest stops for when you need to use the bathroom or switch drivers and began our hike from there. After about 2 hours of hiking, we found a clearing in the forest. It was roughly 30 feet across and just as wide. We immediately began setting up camp. David began to set up the tent and I went to collect some branches for kindling. While collecting some kindling I heard something off in the distance. I wasn’t sure what it was at first, but then I heard it again and the noise was much clearer. Laughter. I mentioned what I heard to David and we agreed it was most likely just someone else camping nearby. I was a little disappointed at the idea that this site wasn’t as isolated as we thought. But I wasn’t going to let this ruin our trip. 

After setting up our camp, we went looking for the mountain view we heard so much about. Amazingly, it was only a 15 minute hike from our site. The view was beautiful. The vibrant oranges and reds of early autumn spread across the rolling mountains was something I never tired of. We sat on the edge of the cliff and enjoyed our trail mix while taking in the nature Vermont is known for. Once we began to pack up and head back, I heard the laughter. Closer this time. It was coming from down the cliff and it was much clearer. It was high pitched and giggly, like that of a small child. I pointed this out to David but he didn’t hear anything. He played it off as being the wind or maybe the campers I heard earlier. I really wanted to believe him but something about the laughter was just wrong. 

I pushed down my concerns and we returned to camp. The sun was starting to go down when we got back to camp so David got a fire going while I started prepping dinner. We sat in our chairs roasting hot dogs over the fire just talking when I heard that damn laughter a third time. At this point I was getting a little freaked out. David heard it this time and agreed that it was creepy but said it was probably nothing to worry about.  He rationalized that it was probably just other campers but just in case we would load the Glock 19 and keep the handgun and bear spray close when we went to sleep. This made me feel more comfortable about staying. I didn’t want the trip to end but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I eventually relaxed enough to fall asleep. I woke up a couple hours later in the pitch black. I wasn’t sure why I woke up or why I could seem to get back to sleep. That was until I heard that fucking laughter again. 

Only this time, it was so distant. It was close. Very close. I sounded almost right outside my tent. It almost seemed to bounce around, coming from different directions until it was coming from every direction. It was almost deafening when it suddenly stopped. I quickly turned to David and yelled for him to grab the gun. When I didn’t hear him, I grabbed my flashlight and tried to shake him up. I grabbed at him only to realize I was shaking an empty sleeping bag. The moment I realized he was gone was when I heard a smack on the side of the tent. It was a hand. The small hand of a child. Then another and another and another all accompanied by that same laughter. Coming from every direction was that fucking laughter so loud I thought my ear drums were going to pop. Suddenly, to my horror, the hands started pressing in on the tent and the walls began to close in on me. Between the deafening laughter and claustrophobia of the tent being pressed in, I felt myself freezing up. I only broke out of my daze when thoughts of David crept into my end. Where was he? Did whoever or whatever was doing this have him? Did it hurt him? 

I felt a rush of anger and adrenaline like nothing I’d ever felt before. I grabbed my gun and flashlight and tore out of the tent. I screamed into the night and let off a shot. That shot brought the woods to an instant silence. I quickly scanned the clearing, calling for David. That was when I noticed a pile of leaves on the other side of the clearing at the base of a large tree. I slowly crept over terrified of what I might find. I quietly called for David until my flashlight caught a glimpse of David’s flannel under the leaves. I brushed the leaves aside and was met with David. His skin was pale and cold to the touch. His eyes were still and lifeless. My David was dead. Upon seeing my husband dead, all my confidence was replaced by pure dread. This dread was closely followed by laughter. That damn laughter, taunting me. 

My fight or flight hit me hard and I chose flight. I grabbed my bag and ran in the direction of the trail head, the laughter following me the whole time. When I arrived at the car, I locked myself inside and called 911, begging for help. Some rangers and state troopers showed up with an ambulance in tow. They scoured the woods finding my campsite and my David but little else. David’s death was officially ruled an accident though they never could explain how the accident happened. But I know what happened. Something in those woods killed him. It’s still out there and I think it might have followed me home. Sometimes, on quiet nights, when I listen closely on my back porch, I hear the faint sound of a child’s laughter.

NoSleep,I Played Games On No Games Day,"I needed to put this somewhere online, for nobody I’ve ever spoken to about that day seems to recall a single event. And I assure you, reader, that all of this happened without a doubt in my mind. But everyone doubts me! So if even one person can relate to anything I’m about to write about that day, I beg of you to say something! It’ll calm my scattered mind.

The day was February 29, 2020. And besides the date, and the spreading threat of the coronavirus, you’d assume it to be a regular day. The sun shone bright across the gray winter sky, birds were singing, and the wind rushed steadily between trees. I was making my way through a local trail, roughly thirty minutes away from home. It cut through woods and large open fields, making for a decently long walk before looping back to my car.

I encountered but a single oddity whilst traversing through the forest. It was after the path split, leading to a rickety old bridge. Built to safely cross a rushing stream, the bridge lived exactly to expectation. And almost fell apart. That was not the weird part! Within the path of the stream rested a large, disk-shaped hunk of metal. It reflected light as would a mirror, and I could see my face within. After crossing the bridge, I figured that it was only reasonable to try and get a closer look. But that was about all. It didn’t seem damaged in any way, and so I figured the object was left behind by somebody else. Or perhaps it had to be there for an important reason. Either way, I really didn’t think much of it.

The air was fresh and cool, and the forest’s scent was pleasant. I continued my walk and passed an open field with a great view of the Atlantic, crossing through a section of thick greenery until reaching for my keys, unlocking the car door. It was quiet. And the hum of the engine was singularly masking said silence.

The drive was long due to traffic; an accident had occurred on the highway. Again, I thought nothing of it. Figured it was just bad luck, that’s all. And so I continued on, pressing upon the accelerator, then upon the brakes, a never ending cycle, until I finally passed the bottleneck. I drove a little under the speed limit and made it home.

Taking off my coat, I placed it upon the back of a chair. My place is comfy, and I don’t usually have company over, and the neighbors in the next-door apartments are usually pretty quiet. The area is fairly rural too, making it convenient to walk anywhere important. 

After cleaning up a bit, the sun started to set, and the sky grew into a dark, calming red. And after stepping outside and watching it cross the horizon, I thought about much of the past and of the many intricacies of everyday life, enthralled completely in thought. I eventually stepped back inside, meandering my way over to the couch. Of course I would choose to play games for the rest of the night! as there is not a better way to pass the time.

It was around eight-thirty when the building started to shake. And a glow flashed outside the blinds, casting light rays through suspended dust. Soon it stopped, but I was shocked, and paused everything I was doing, and stepped outside to investigate. Everything seemed natural. I know I hadn’t imagined it! Pacing up and down the street, a single street lamp was lit, shining through a layer of fog. The wind howled. 

It was nine thirty when I dragged myself back inside. In itself, that was hard for me to do. The world felt as though it was rotating around me. It was impossible to concentrate.

Then static echoed from the television, and snow covered the screen. Over time it grew louder. My ears bled. In a flash of bright red, I was somewhere else entirely; patterns covered the steel surroundings, emitting crimson light. My arms were being held, and as much as I tried, I couldn’t scream. A sticky substance was soaked into my clothing. They towered above, speaking in their own dialect. Their appearance for which I cannot describe, was horrid and near-incomprehensible.

Soon they spoke English, in a scratchy, deep voice: “Calm down. We need to know why you interact with such devices. Think about the answer. We can read your thoughts.”

It hadn’t crossed my mind what those things could be referring to. They held me tighter, shining lights into my eyes, in all sorts of colors.

“Why? Tell us. We need to know to further understand!”

Then it clicked! “I play them to pass the time, as some sort of distraction,” I thought.

There was a long pause. “Very well,” echoed the voice. “That’s all we need to know. And there's others we need to ask the same!”

Pain surged through my veins. I saw many glimpses and hues indescribable to man. There were places seen that may or may not be real. The screeching was deafening. There was one last thing I heard through the ringing:

“Useless, useless! Such an unproductive activity. How could they experience joy from such a thing?” The voice trailed off, and continued in another dialect.

Everything went black. For a while, my senses ceased to function. Everything was void. Then I saw stars, and a collection of color and beauty. The nebulas erupted with vibrancy. And for a bit, all was calm. I can only imagine the things they did to me whilst I was asleep. I’ve never felt the same ever since. 

When I woke, I assumed it all to be a dream. Because surely such bizarreness is only possible within a dreamscape! I opened my eyes. The sun creeped through the windows. All was silent, besides the chirping birds. I felt oddly energized, yet I ceased to move. I didn't know what to think. But when I finally decided to regain myself, I noticed a horrid scent, and sat up. It was me who reeked of vile! And my clothes felt awfully stiff!

No matter what I say, no soul I express to has believed a word. So am I insane? Somebody out there *has* to be able to recall something similar, somebody! Please reach out. As I wrote before, it would greatly ease my thoughts, and I shall live with eased discomfort regarding that day. Just to know that I hadn’t been alone! Thanks, reader. Truly, thank you. And spread the word!",16,0.83,0,AJRoia,2024-11-10 10:23:23,1go4c9c,16,High
NoSleep,Cheeky the clown ,"It was me,my dad and my little sister driving down a dirt road in October 2016. I was shit scared of going out at night because of this clown bullshit everyone was on about at school.

We were going to my grandma's for the night and I hate to say it but we may of got lost and ended up on a random dirt road. My dad is an easily angered man so when he figured out his satnav wasn't working he was not happy. But tried to distract himself with the radio. 

Well me and my sister were playing eye spy and as we approaching a bridge she went dead silent and didn't move a muscle. She gently tapped me on the shoulder and gestured for me to look out of the window. And I shit you not somebody in a clown costume was stood on the bridge. We noticed a sign in his hand that read ""cheeky the clown"". 

He must've noticed we were looking at him as he waved at us and started to walk with the car. My sister waved back but I yanked her hand and told her to stop as I certainly didn't want to be on the news the next morning. 

We got off the bridge and he stopped following us. From what I can remember he was about six foot, certainly a good build and the costume only made him look bigger. 

My dad was oblivious to the clown as he was focused on the road and the radio. We continued too play eye spy for the rest of the drive and we ended up forgetting about it. Well my sister did I in fact didn't I was plagued all night at my grandma's thinking about it.

Well the next morning we were going home and decided to take the same dirt road as my sister said it was ""so fun to play eye spy"". But on the dirt road a tree had collapsed and we had to follow another dirt road which lead to the bridge. This took us until night we were on the bridge and this time I was on the side where we saw cheeky and I didn't see him. Until we had gotten of the bridge I looked out of the back window. And there he was with the sign but this time covered in blood. He began walking towards us and then began running towards us. My dad asked what I was looking at and as he saw cheeky with a bloody knife in hand running at our car he stepped on the gas  getting us away as fast as he could. 

Over the years I forgot about cheeky until last week I got a letter at my door I opened it and it said ""cheeky hates that you don't visit him anymore"". I thought it was just my sister playing a prank on me until a couple days after I received another letter it contained pictures of my house, my kitchen and most disturbingly a picture of me sleeping. And it contained a note ""cheeky misses you"" written in blood the blood looked extremely fresh and well for the next  part to make sense I need to go back about a month ago. 

So about a month ago I let my dog paddy out for a wee as you do. And he wasn't there when I shouted for him I searched my back garden and he wasn't there at all no trace apart from a bit of blood near the shed. I put up posters and searched all over for him but no trace of him. Until the letter. 

Behind the pictures and note there was hairs black curly hairs. Paddy's hair. I sent these in to the police and they confirmed it was Paddy's hair. I have since moved out of this house and gone to my parents and haven't received anything from cheeky. I haven't heard back from the police about this investigation since and I honestly don't know what to do this will most likely be my last post on this unless I gain an update.",15,1.0,2,sigmajones35-,2024-11-10 11:22:46,1go5psj,17,High
NoSleep,The Light Above the Trees.,"I have always been fascinated when it comes to the supernatural. Paranormal. And just unexplained things in general. But aliens. Extraterrestrials have always been my favorite because I've always believed in those the most. 


To me the idea that there's life in the universe other than ourselves. And that this life had found its way to us and has been watching us had always seemed far more possible than the idea that there's a giant 9 foot tall ape man wandering around the United states. At least in my opinion.


I'd always loved watching cheesy ""Real"" Ufo videos on YouTube. Along with conspiracy theories and stories from alien abduction victims. I've never really believed those videos were real because it's very easy to lie and make stuff up and barely any of them had evidence to support them. But I was still intrigued by them simply because of my love for the idea of extraterrestrials. But I'd never experienced anything myself... 


until a couple months ago.


I live out in the middle of the country. There's nobody around me, the nearest house is at least a mile away. My house is in the middle of multiple fields. Surrounding the fields almost completely are trees. There's a couple ponds at the edge of the trees where me and my dad used to go fishing when i was a kid. It's a beautiful place to say the least


I have a German shepherd and a bulldog. I usually walk them both a mile each in the evening before the sun goes down. It's nice and cool in the evening and I have a perfect view of the sunset when I go out walking. I usually walk to the pond which is about half a mile away. So it's a mile to walk there and back. One night I was walking my female bulldog back home from her walk and I noticed this light above the trees North from my house. I assumed like most people would that it was a star. Because the sun was about to go fully down and they would start coming out. But I had never seen it before and it seemed brighter than the others that had started to show. But I dismissed the idea that it was abnormal and finished walking my pup. 


That night was the start of the dreams.

I'm not a big Dreamer anymore. If I do dream i almost always forget them by morning. As far as I know it was nothing but darkness until I wake up. And if I do remember something it's usually very blurry. But not this time. 

It was a very short dream. But it was extremely vivid. In the dream I was laying in my bed. I'm not sure if I was asleep in the dream or just laying with my eyes closed. But I remember hearing this loud Humming sort of noise. The only thing I can compare it with is if you hear a semi truck driving by alone on the road and you hear it slowly getting closer and closer and the tires on the road mixed with the engine and the wind rushing past it make a very specific loud hum... anyway I open my eyes in the dream and I listen and the noise gets louder and louder and things in my room start vibrating. And it just stops suddenly like you flipped an off switch. That's when my whole room lit up from a bright light coming from my window.

I jerked awake and sat up. I checked my phone and it was 6:52 AM. The sun was just rising and the birds were chirping like nothing happened. I looked around for a few seconds still a little groggy and weirded out. But I shrug it off as just a weird dream and nothing more. I continued walking my dogs in the evening like I always have and I didn't see the light above the trees again Until about two weeks later.


I finish up my walk again and that's when I saw it over the trees in the same place. But I noticed something different about it this time. It took me a few minutes to figure out what it was but when I realized what it was it sent shivers down my spine.

It was bigger. Or maybe it was closer. It hadn't doubled in size or anything but it was noticeably different at least. I decided to take out my phone and take a picture of it to compare it if I saw it again. I quickly snap three or four pictures before finishing walking to the house. I give the dogs some water and quickly open my phone to take a look and my heart drops. It wasn't there. I scroll through them muttering to myself as I do so. I walk back outside to look and it was gone.


That night was when the second dream happened.

The dream started very similar to the first. I'm laying on my bed. But I'm not awoken by a loud hum or by some lights outside my window. I'm simply thirsty. I check the time. ""1:43 am"" I groan to myself. I Get up and walk through the house. There's something strange about the house but I'll get to that later. I walk into the kitchen and go To the refrigerator and grab a bottle of water. That's when I do something strange. I decide to go to the window and look outside while I take a drink of my water. And there it is. The light above the trees. I lower the bottle and just stare at it for a few seconds until my blood feels like it turns to ice. I hear this voice. This deep morphed voice in the back of my skull. ""You can't run from the lights"". It echoed through my brain for a few seconds.


That's when I jerk awake. I sit up in my bed sweaty and my hair is a bigger miss than usual. I check the time and it's 3:13 AM. Still pitch black outside. I didn't even try to go back to sleep after that. How could i? I said earlier that there was something off about my house in the dream. And it took my awhile to realize what it was.


But The house was the exact same as it was the day before. For a lot of people that probably doesn't seem like a big deal. But to me it is. Whenever I have a dream I actually remember about the house. It had always been an older version of the house. Like how it looked when I was a kid. I guess because that's how I remembered it most fondly. Even then it was never exactly how it was in real life. There would always be something out of place. If you have dreams about locations you've been I'm sure you know what I mean. Your brain can't picture it perfectly or something I guess so it fills in the blanks. But not this time. It was how my house currently looked and it was perfect.


It didn't take two weeks for me to see the light again. Only one. I had worked overtime at work that day so I was extra exhausted and hadn't taken the dogs for their evening walks. But I put my female bulldog outside in her pen because she had gone into heat and I didn't want her around my male german shepherd while i wasn't supervising. After that i saw it when I was taking the trash to the road for the garbage truck to pick up in the morning. I always try to take it the evening before trash day because sometimes I forget otherwise. I put the bag in the garbage can and I look up and sure enough. It was there. And it was bigger than before. Like it was taunting me. I didn't wanna go to sleep that night but the exhaustion was overwhelming and I had to be at work again tomorrow.


That night was when the third dream occurred. I'm not sure when I fell asleep that night. I layed there for what felt like hours until I finally dozed off. I guess it was around  maybe 11:30 PM give or take. The third dream starts off the same as the other two. I wake up in my bed. My German shepherd is scratching at the door and wining telling me he needs to go outside to use the bathroom. I check my phone and it says 2:21 AM. I walk my dog through the house (which is exactly the same as the last dream) to the backdoor. I put his harness and leash on and we walk outside. I walk him around for about 2 or 3 minutes. He finally finds a spot he deems worthy to do his business. He finishes and we're walking back to the backdoor and that's when my German shepherd just stops and his ears perk up and he looks towards the side of the house. My female bulldog starts barking and growling from her pen and my German shepherd starts barking as they both look around the side of the house. A few seconds go by and this thing. This creature just runs around the side of the house towards me. It crosses 20 feet in just a couple strides. 


And that's when I wake up. But I don't jerk awake like I do the last two times. I just wake up and open my eyes. My feet are tingling and I have goosebumps all over my body. I don't move because I just feel like I'm being watched. I lay there for what feels like an eternity until I finally get up the courage to move. I slowly sit up and look around. Everything seems fine. I check my phone and it says 6:03 AM. I get up turn the light on. I get chills as I look on my arm. Bruises. Bruises On both my arms. Nothing huge. But they were there.


I don't know if its aliens. Or if I'm going insane. Maybe its both. But something is happening to me. I've woken up with more bruises and marks on my arms and back. I've tried to tell my friends and they all tell me I need therapy. Maybe I do. I don't know what's happening. I try to sleep as little as possible now. Once every couple days. And I try to sneak it in during the day when I do. I feel bad for taking my dogs for less walks now. But when I do I can't help but feel like I'm being watched.

NoSleep,Mr. Butler's Job: Basement to hell.," It was the summer of 2022. I just finished my freshman year at college. I wanted to get a job over the summer. Especially since my college tuition was so high. My roommate, Troy, suggested working at his father’s restaurant. I considered taking him up on this offer but then I saw a job on craigslist.

 “No experience necessary. Work is for one month. 24/7 on the clock work. Location: Oregon Pay: $100,000”. The job posting was only up for a few minutes. I immediately rushed and applied. Thinking back on it now, I was a dumbass for not questioning the job posting at all. It had no details. Location was in Oregon, which would mean I had to travel across the country (I lived in Massachusetts). But I didn’t question it. A few minutes later I got a text. It said my application was accepted and gave me an address, date and time to meet.

 The next week I flew out to Oregon, rented a car and drove to the specified location at the specified time and pulled up to a mansion. The mansion was in the middle of nowhere. It wasn’t one of those modern mcmansions. It had gothic style architecture that you would see in Europe. It was beautiful. Standing outside of the mansion was a middle aged man. He wore a suit, his dark hair was combed back and he had a well trimmed mustached. I extend my hand and said, “I’m Samuel. Nice to meet you”.

 He didn’t shake my hand. Instead he stared at me intently for a few seconds before saying, “Henry Butler”. He took out a one hundred dollar bill and put it in my shirt pocket. “There’s more where that came from”.

“Uh… thank you, Henry?”, I puzzledly said.

“Please, please.”, he said, “Call me Mr. Butler. We should be on casual, friendly terms”.

 I was so confused. Don’t people who are on casual terms call each other by their first name instead of last name? I shrugged and followed him to the mansion. I opened the front door for him. He smiled and said, “Thank you”. Took out another one hundred dollar bill and put it in my shirt pocket. What a strange man, I thought to myself.

 He showed me a tour of the mansion. Constantly putting hundred dollar bills in my shirt pocket. Near the end of the tour I had over two thousand dollars in my shirt pocket. The mansion was sick. Had a movie theater, swimming pool, basketball court.

 “I have to say, you’re really brave for taking this job Sam”, Mr. Butler said walking in front of me as we were continuing the tour.

“So … what is the job exactly?”, I asked.

He immediately stopped and turned towards me, “It’s quite simple really. You just take care of this mansion for a month while I’m away. You’ll have to live here 24/7. There’s a bedroom upstairs for you to sleep in.”.

Wait, that’s the job? I thought to myself. For $100,000, I pretty much do nothing and enjoy this sweet mansion? This is the sweetest gig ever.

Trying to not sound too excited I asked, “What is the catch”.

“Uh, well”, he nervously replied, “Well … you know what. Maybe it’s better if I show you. Walk with me”.

We walked down a large hallway. He immediately extended his arm to stop me when we reached the end. “Don’t get any closer”, he sternly ordered.

About 5 meters in front of us were stairs which looked like they were leading to the mansion’s basement. The basement was pitch black. All you could see was the stairs leading down darkness. But the weird thing was I could hear moaning and screaming coming from the basement.

“What is that screaming and moaning”, I whispered.

“Well … um”, he sheepishly replied. “What if I tell you this is an entrance to hell?”.

He studied my face to see what I was thinking. To see if I thought he was crazy.

“Excuse me?”, I eventually blurted out.

“What if I told you that if you go down these stairs you will be going to hell and you won’t be able to get back up to the living. The screaming and moaning is the sounds of people getting tortured. If you get any closer than where we’re currently standing someone from hell could grab you and drag you down to hell with it. And again, you won’t be able to come back up once you’re down there”.

I started bursting out laughing, “You got me for a second. I actually belie...”. I was suddenly interrupted by even louder screams from the basement.

“Oh great, now they know you’re up here dumbass”, Mr. Butler said shaking his head, “They want you down there with them. They’re jealous that you’re alive.” He turned around and started walking away from the basement.

“So yeah, never go near the basement”, he said as he continued walking, “If you avoid going near that area you should be fine.”

I just stood there, bewildered. Trying to take in what I was just told.

“Well, are you coming or not”, he said while continuing to walk away and not looking back. After a few seconds, I rushed towards and started following him.

“There is one more thing”, Mr. Butler said, “The demons and other souls from hell can come up the stairs and roam the mansion from 12am – 6am everyday. And trust me, based on the reaction we just heard from them, they want you. They want you bad. The only safe place in the mansion during those hours is in your bedroom. Close and lock your bedroom door from 12am – 6am every day. You must do this!”.

He looked at me sternly. “A few other things. You can’t leave the mansion once in this month. You should have more than enough food in the fridge and food cellar to last you that long. Just stay in this mansion. If you do this I will give you the $100,000”.

“But why”, I asked, “What exactly is the point to all of this?”.

He smiled, “My job is to watch over this gateway to hell. I’ve been doing this for decades. Someone must monitor and be in the mansion 24/7. Your job is to watch over it while I’m away”.

We walked back to the entrance of the mansion. “And that should be it, as I soon as I leave this mansion you’re in charge. Any questions?”.

I thought for a few seconds. Honestly, it is kinda creepy. But it still should be a pretty easy job. Just avoid the basement, lock my bedroom door from 12-6 am everyday. Easy. And $100,000 after all of this. Should be enough to pay off my college tuition and still have some money left over.

“Nah, I’m good”, I said, “I’m ready”.

“Great”, Mr. Butler exclaimed, “You have my number if you have any questions”. He took out another one hundred dollar bill and put it in my shirt pocket.

“Why do you keep putting money in my shirt pocket?”, I asked.

“I like showing off my wealth”, Mr. Butler said chuckling. ""He is a strange guy"", I thought to myself.

The first few days were pretty easy. The place had no internet. So that was a bit tough. I honestly spent most time in the movie theater. The place had cable and a large selection of movies. So yeah, even though there was no cable, I was still entertained. At midnight I did what he said, went to my bedroom and locked the door. The first few nights I had trouble sleeping because the concept of people from hell roaming about in the mansion while I was in the bedroom was kinda disturbing to me. I could sometimes hear footsteps and moaning outside my bedroom door. I think they were trying to find me and didn’t know I was in the bedroom. But after the first few days, I started to sleep like a baby. But then, after the first week, they figured out I was in the bedroom.

I woke up on the 8^(th) night to screaming and banging on my door. They were trying to get in. I decided to call Mr. Butler.

“Hello?”, he replied.

“Mr. Buter”, I whispered, “They know I’m in the room”.

“Speak up, dude”, he sounded annoyed.

“They’re… they’re banging on the bedroom door”, I said a little bit louder, “They know I’m hear”.

“Is your door locked?”.

 “Yes.”.

“Then you’re fine”, he said and immediately hung up the phone.

 The nights continued like this. Constant screaming and banging on the door. The stress started to get to me and I couldn't sleep. I started sleeping during the day and stayed up during the night. I would put on airpods and listen to music to drown out the noise.  Eventually I started getting used to this.

 But then things got even worse during the third week. I was catching up on sleep during the day when I woke up to a moaning sound. “That must be my imagination”, I thought. I’m in the bedroom. I only hear the moaning or screaming sounds during the daytime if I’m near the basement.  But then I heard even more moaning and screaming sounds. It wasn’t my imagination. In fact throughout the whole mansion I could hear it. I soon figure out the sounds were still coming from the basement. It just that the residence from hell were now being much louder and it was echoing throughout the hall mansion. I decided to call Mr. Butler again.

“No worries”, he said.

 “What do you mean no worries?”, I asked, “I can’t deal with this shit. It’s now 24/7 screaming”.

 “They just want you really bad and are getting annoyed that they can’t get you”, he chuckled.

""Is that suppose to make me feel better!"", I shouted.

“But they can’t get to you. Don’t worry. They can’t come out of the basement during the day. And as long as you lock the door during the night, they can’t get to you.”

“But the screaming is now 24/7! I can’t take this anymore!!!”.

“Look, you have less than two weeks left. You can manage”. Then he hung up the phone.

 So I tried to deal with it. But I couldn’t get any sleep. 24/7 sounds of agony and screaming started to torment and traumatize me. Eventually, during the night, the demons started replicating my family and friends voices outside my door. Asking me to let them in. I don’t know how they knew about my family and friends. I continued to ignore them. Eventually they stop replicating their voices and started threatening to harm my loved ones if I wouldn’t let them in. They continued to try psychologically torture me night after night.

I don’t know how I put up with it, but it was finally the final day. I was so excited. After that night I could finally leave this place behind me. Due to my excitement, I couldn’t sleep during that final day. I was about to doze off around 11 pm. Right as I was about to go to sleep, I remembered that I didn’t lock the door yet. I immediately jolted myself back awake and locked the door. “That was close”, I thought. I jumped back to bed and immediately went to sleep. Around 2 am I heard a knocking on the bedroom door.

“Hey, Sam”, Mr. Butler said behind the door, “I came home a bit early. Good job! Can you let me in?”.

I was half asleep, not thinking straight. I was just excited that I was finally done with this place. I unlocked and opened the bedroom door and immediately realized what I just done. All I saw was a dark, lanky figure. The figure resembled that of a human but there was something off about it. I realized that dark figure was a demon and just replicated Mr. Butler’s voice to covince me to open the door. I was immediately overcome with great terror. I tried to slam the door, but it was too late.  It grabbed me before I could close the door and started dragging me away. I started screaming, I knew it was dragging me to the basement, to hell.

 I struggled in vain to get out of the demon’s grasp. But its grip was too strong. I continued to scream again and again. Eventually I could tell it was dragging me down the large hallway that led to the basement. The screaming and moaning from hell continued to get louder and louder. This time there was a tint of excitement in their screams. They knew they finally got me. It was at that point I accepted my fate. I should have never come here. But then a great flash of light came out of nowhere. The demon screamed out of fear and let go of my grip. The flash of light went away. I looked for the source of the flash of light. It came from Mr. Butler.

“That was close”, Mr. Butler said.

""Mr. Butler?”, I exclaimed. I was still on the floor.

 Mr. Butler extended his hand, “It was lucky I came back a few hours early. That demon almost dragged you to hell”.

I asked Mr. Butler, “Who are you? Your job isn’t really to watch the gateway to hell is it? Why did you hire me for this job?”.

He smiled, “You’re right, I lied. I don’t watch over hell.. Why did I hire you to do this? That's not your concern”.

And so that was my final night at the mansion. I was more than happy to leave it behind me for good. And I got my $100000. I was happy not to see that Mr. Butler ever again too.

It’s been two years since that day. I’m now in my senior year of college. Everything was fine up to this point. However, tonight I just got a text from Mr. Butler. He wants me to do another job. I ignored the text at first. But he sent me another saying it’s for $1 million and that there’s nothing supernatural about this new job. Do you think I should take it?",34,0.96,4,bobbdac7894,2024-11-10 02:09:32,1gnvwfj,38,High
NoSleep,I’m being told to leave my apartment.  (Part 2),"A lot has happened since I asked [ya’ll for help](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/E3KEn0Jnh8). It’s been a week since the crazy lady knocked at my door, urging me to leave, and I’ve taken the advice you gave me.

The morning after her visit, I went over to my new local electronics store and bought myself a doorbell camera.  On my way out, I stopped by the security booth at the entrance of my complex and chatted with the guard.  He was a middle aged, unshaven, reeking, fat man - the embodiment of the consequences of overdrinking.   I explained what had happened, giving him a condensed version of what you read.

“Crazy lady? I haven’t seen no crazy lady,” he murmured without lifting his gaze from his phone. He watched his YouTube video as if his life depended on it.

“Hey man,” I said, trying to sound as understanding and amicable as possible. “This is a pretty serious situation.  Besides freaking me out, is this not a ‘safety’ issue? Take the ‘crazy’ out of the equation. Isn’t it concerning that someone is knocking at my door in the middle of the night and threatening me?” 

“If there was a crazy lady, I would have seen her…” His voice droned monotonously. 

I know a hopeless cause when I see one - he was set on dedicating his attention to YouTube. 

“Alright, thank you for your time. Can you do me a favor?”

He grunted, neither a yes or no.

“I’m sure you’re not here 24 hours a day. Can you share this with whoever else works this booth? I know you probably think it’s nothing, but it would make me feel a lot better.

He muttered the most unenthusiastic “sure” I have ever heard.

I drove off and bought the doorbell camera.  I set the alert level to max sensitivity, but yielded much help.  Besides flying birds, cars, or the occasional neighbor walking by, my camera’s motion sensor remained dormant.  No crazy lady in sight.

Next, I took your advice and went to my local police department yesterday. But my conversation was just as fruitful as the one with the guard.

“Do you know her name?” the officer asked.

“No.”

“Do you know anyone who might know her?

“No. I just moved here a few days ago.”

“Can you describe her besides as slim and crazy looking?” He smirked when saying the word “crazy” as if I were the crazy one.

“Not really”

“So there isn’t much we can do, now is there?” he said with a smug smile.  “So if this crazy lady appears again, you give us a call at that moment.”

I didn’t have the energy.  I thanked him for his time and left. 

Driving into my complex, I stopped by the Community Center, where our individual mail boxes are located.  I stood in the mail room, filtering the mail still being delivered to the previous tenant, when someone tapped my shoulder.

“You the new guy at 217?” he asked, referring to my apartment number.  He was a thin African American man in his 30’s.  He wore khakis, a dressy shirt tucked in, and black-rimmed  glasses.  He oozed positivity and friendliness - the anti security guard. 

“I am.  Why do you ask?”  

He shook my hand enthusiastically, big smile across his face.

“My name is Michael - Mike - , I’m new here, too.”  

He chatted for a few minutes with great ease. He explained he was an attorney at a firm whose name I can’t remember.  He had also just moved here and had made a few friends around the complex.  I guess he’s more sociable than me.

“You’re famous, you know?” He eyed me, testing the waters to see if I were open to joke about this  topic

That piqued my interest.

“Really? Why is that?” I asked, trying to sound calm and cool.

“Well, you know…” he smirked. “You’re the new guy in 217.”  he stared at me as if saying, come on, you know!

His phone began to ring, and he began pawing at his pockets, trying to find it.

“I don’t know…What do you mean?”

“Oh come on! You have to know!” He said.  “Everyone knows!” He located his phone and began examining it with a squint 

“Who’s everyone…wait no, who cares…What does everyone know? I don’t have any idea what you’re talking about.” My heart rate elevated noticeably.

His eyes peered above his glasses reading his phone.  

“You know,” he said, reverting to his attorney’s slow monotone autopilot  voice, still staring at his iPhone. “The apartment complex is legally obligated to disclose if such activity occurred in your apartment before you signed your lease.  If you did not receive verbal and written notice of it, they could be liable to a….Sorry bud, gotta take this. Work, ya know?” He flashed his smile; the attorney was gone, the friendly neighbor was back.  “I can’t be the new guy who doesn’t answer his boss, regardless of the time.”

“No no - hang on!” I said louder than I should have.

But it was too late.  He lifted his finger at me, holding the phone to his ear with his other hand, indicating a hang on. I stood there waiting for his call to finish.

“Ah shit! I mean…sorry… Yes, let me get you that info…give me a few minutes.” he blurted to his phone. His cheeks flushed upon having cursed at his new boss.

He tilted his phone a bit away from his mouth, still at his ear.  

“Hey man, it was nice meeting you, gotta run.” he said, flashing his smile.

“No Mike, hold on!” I said to his back.  But it was futile, he was out talking rapidly to his iPhone. 

I locked up my mailbox and ran out trying to catch him, but only saw his talking head through the driver’s seat window as he drove off in his Mercedes.  I got in my car and drove around frantically searching for that car.  He must have a unit with a garage, because it was nowhere in sight.  

That night - which was last night - at 2:30am, my doorbell camera’s motion sensor went off.  I was in bed reading, when my phone received the notification. At that moment, Chance jumped our of bed and ran to the front door, huffing and puffing. I ignored him and opened my camera app as quickly as possible.  Chance began to let out wild barks, pawing at the door.  

My camera feed was a black screen.  

I refreshed it, but the black screen persisted. I refreshed it and refreshed it. I closed the app and restarted my phone.  Still, the black screen taunted me. 

Chance fury intensified.  Something was angering him on the other side of the door.

Staring at the black screen live video feed, I raised the volume and realized I was receiving an audio feed. Chance’s barks emitted from my phone on a 3 second delay, echoing his real life anger.

It finally clicked for me.

I couldn’t believe it, but I had to verify.  

My camera saves the last 30 seconds before the motion sensor is triggered.  I clicked the notification I had received a few minutes early.  My heart sank.

Chance came trotting back into my room triumphantly, as if his duty as the guardian of the house was fulfilled - danger had been averted.  

I stared at the saved video feed that triggered my camera’s recording.  The video began with an image of the front of my apartment. Everything was calm, unmoving, and motionless.  Suddenly, a hand from the corner of the feed emerged, blocking the camera’s view, leaving it entirely black.  The video ended.

WIthout thinking, I rushed to the front door, swung it open, not caring of the noise I was causing at that late hour, and looked at my doorbell camera.  

A black strip of electrical tape had been placed on the camera lens. I shut the door to began removing it, and my heart sank even lower. 

At the corner of my eyes, I noticed 3 dark lines marking my door.  They formed an arrow pointing downward.  I touched the lines, and whatever was used to mark was still wet.  Once again, I wondered if this was blood; I rushed to wash and disinfect my hand.

And now, here I am, once again coming to you for help.

I’m afraid of calling the cops at this hour, and once again, being dismissed as crazy. It’s the weekend, and my apartment complex administration doesn’t work weekends. You bet I will be there as soon as they open on Monday.  

I truly don’t know what to do.  More and more, I’m beginning to think that this is something serious.  I’m becoming convinced that the concept of an elaborate prank isn’t feasible.

NoSleep,I'm a security guard at a failing mall and I just found something awful in the basement.,"""Hey, I just got a complaint that some guy is washing his dick in the men’s room sink, can one of you guys go deal with this? I had to kick the mad shitter out this morning, again.”

I groaned, then picked my radio up to answer.

""Alright Connor, but did the mad shitter try to kiss you again this time?"" I said, grinning into my radio like he could see me.

""Fuck you, she had a handful of shit ready to go. I really don't know why she hates the *GAP* so much. We seriously need guys posted at the front doors of this place at all times.""

""Alright buddy, I'm almost at the bathroom, I'll get back to you.""

I walked into the men’s bathroom, and sure enough, there was an older, homeless looking man with his junk in the sink.

“Hey, man, you gotta stop what you’re doing. I can’t have you washing your dick off in the sink here.”

“My dick?” The man replied perplexed, not stopping what he was doing for even a second. “Ohhhh! You must mean my *wand!*” he replied.

I groaned. “Whatever you say pal, just put it back in your pants, for the love of god.”

“No can do, I’m affected by evil ailments, I must cleanse the dark juices off before it is too late.”

I had had just about enough of this and walked up behind the man to detain him but he spun around with the quickness of a gazelle, startling me.

“I THINK NOT!” He exclaimed, jumping away from me. “I am a warlock of the highest caliber! I have been protecting this realm before you were a twinkle in your fathers eye.”

“Look, this doesn’t have to be difficult, I just need you to go and we can put this all behind us.”

“DID YOU HEAR THAT?! THEY’RE BACK!.”

The man screamed and started to windmill his dick around in a circle and began to piss. I ran out of the bathroom and grabbed my radio to fill my coworkers in on the situation and get some backup. There was no way in hell I was about to wrestle with a half naked pissing lunatic in a failing malls bathroom alone.

A few minutes later I finally saw Connor and my other coworker, Jeff, strolling down the hallway to the washrooms.

""Took your sweet time guys"".

""Relax, I wasn't about to face off with your boyfriend on an empty stomach"" Jeff said, sucking doughnut frosting off of his fingers.

Conner sighed ""ok guys, we gotta work together here, we go in single file and surround this weirdo.""

We all agreed and Jeff (bald, buff and the most intimidating of us) went in first.

""Helloooo? Mr wizard? Are you... oh god damn it!""

Me and Connor quickly ran in and noticed the air vent had been ripped off of the wall.

""This asshole went down to the basement!"" Jeff yelled.

""What a pain in the ass, I guess we better go find him."" Connor said, rubbing the bridge of his nose with his index finger and thumb like an annoyed dad.

We made our way through the employees only doors and down a small hallway of offices until we reached a locked set of double doors. After trying almost half the keys on the cartoonishly large mall key ring, I heard a *click* and the knob turned. There was a rickety old set of wooden steps in front of us leading down to basement.

I turned on the little flashlight I keep on my security belt next to my taser and proceeded down the steps. Every board creaked and groaned underneath me and the middle of the steps bowed, threatening to break the deeper I descended.

I made it to the bottom and began looking around for a light switch when I heard a scream followed by a crash behind me. I spun around to see Jeff had fallen through the stairs, taking most of them with him.

""Jesus fuck! You ok down there?"" I heard Connor yell from above us.

""I'm fine, I slipped in something"" Jeff said, brushing himself off. ""But there's no chance we're getting back up that way. Go look for a ladder or something while we look for that little shit ball.""

I could see Connor nod and dart away from the door as me and Jeff explored the room. I found the small beaded chain from an overhead light hanging from the ceiling and pulled it, illuminating the room in a warm fluorescent glow. Unfortunately, I could now also see that the room we were in was covered with thick, wet looking black mold that consumed the walls and ceiling.

""That's the shit I slipped in, it's sticking like glue."" Jeff said, scraping his boot across the concrete floor.

Behind me was the malls HVAC system for ventilation, unlabeled boxes of odds and ends, a few fake Christmas trees and... a trap door that led somewhere deeper then we already were.

""Well, he's not in here. Let's check that out."" Jeff said, pointing at the trap door.

""We don't know if he's down there, we should wait for Connor.""

""Well he's certainly not in this room, but he came this way."" Jeff gestured at a piece of ventilation that had been kicked open.

Jeff wrenched the heavy looking door open and I was starting to feel claustrophobic just watching him descend the ladder.

""I really don't know about this Jeff..."" I started to say.

""Oooooooh spooky hole in the ground, I'm shaking like Michael J Fox. C'mon pussy, get your ass down here!"" Jeff snapped at me.

I followed Jeff down the ladder into some cement tunnel that seemed to stretch endlessly. I cautiously walked behind Jeff being careful not to touch the mold covered walls. Eventually the tunnel split into three different directions, then three more different directions.

""What is this?"" I asked.

""City's old. People used to use these underground tunnels to connect businesses together. Made it easy for city repairmen to get from place to place faster or some shit."" Jeff replied.

That's when I noticed the mold Jeff had slipped in had made its way from his boot all the way up his leg.

""Jeff, your leg-"" I started to say, but the words caught in my throat. Jeff tried brushing it off with his hands but it clung to them and began rapidly spreading up his massive arms onto his face.

""What the fu-"" Jeff couldn't even finish his sentence before his mouth began filling up with that black slime. He made some awful gurgling noises and I saw the black shit streaming out of his tear ducks as he clawed at his face before collapsing onto the ground.

""Jeff? Jeff?!"" I yelled, I wanted to shake him but I didn't want that shit getting on me too. Then I heard a voice from behind me.

""I see it got your friend""

I just about jumped out of my skin. I shined my flashlight up to see the homeless man from the bathroom walking toward me.

""I warned you about the sinister things!"" He screamed running up to Jeff and blocking my view of him.

""What is this shit, what do you know?!""

""It's from hell, it's from space! It's from the sixth dimension!!"" The man began rambling nonsense off at a machine guns pace. I was so distracted I didn't even notice Jeff slowly getting to his feet until his huge hands clamped over the hobos mouth.

He slid his hands into the tramps mouth, one on the bottom jaw and the other on the top and slowly began pulling them apart. I watched the mans flesh tearing away and heard a *snap*! As his jaw broke. Then Jeff completely ripped the top portion of the man's head off, leaving only the bottom jaw attached to his neck.

Jeff's eyes were completely black and the mold was flowing out of his mouth and nose like a faucet. Then he slowly began to grin at me, I screamed and ran, trying desperately to retrace my steps all while Jeff thundered after me. Eventually I found the ladder and climbed it back into the basement, I struggled to close the heavy steel door but I got a surge of adrenaline as I heard footsteps climbing the metal rings of the ladder and slammed it shut behind me.

I stacked some heavy boxes on top of the door but I can still hear Jeff punching at it.

I don't know when, but at some point, I got some of that mold on myself too. If I don't move, it seems to slow down the spread of it, but it's still slowly making its way up my body.

I hope Connor gets back soon, I've been yelling but nobody's even come to check. If he takes to long, I'm afraid of what might happen to him. What I might do to him.",282,0.96,14,Bongobongosrevenge,2024-11-09 14:39:48,1gnjecc,296,High

After my visit to Mirror Pool, sleep is no longer the escape it once was. Nights are fractured into a string of feverish dreams, each one pulling me back to that lake. I wake up in the dark, feeling like something cold and wet is clutching my wrist. I tell myself it’s just leftover adrenaline, but I can’t shake the feeling that my reflection—or whatever I saw in the water—followed me home.

 

I try to keep it to myself, but when I start seeing her in every reflective surface, I lose it. I find myself avoiding mirrors, covering anything that might show my reflection. Yet, every glimpse, every accidental glance, shows her lingering, waiting. And each time, that twisted, unsettling smile is there, barely concealed. The worst part is that I’m beginning to feel it pulling at me. It’s like every sight of her in glass or water leaves a trace, a calling that digs deeper and deeper.

 

Today, though, I decide to confide in Eli. Eli’s my best friend, and he knew Evelyn almost as well as I did. He’s got this logical, level-headed way of looking at things—exactly what I need right now. We meet at Laketon’s only diner, a place where the lights are bright, and there’s no chance of finding my reflection in a window or a pool of water on the floor.

 

""So, how’ve you been holding up?” he asks, sipping his coffee. His expression is careful, but I can see he’s worried.

 

“I went to Mirror Pool,” I say, and his face darkens. He knew this would happen eventually.

 

“Why would you go back there?” he asks, looking around as if someone might overhear us talking about that place.

 

I tell him about the anniversary, about the things I saw, the voice that called to me from the water, and the reflection I keep seeing in mirrors. As I speak, he listens without interrupting, but I can see the doubt creeping into his eyes.

 

“You’re saying your reflection is… haunted?” He’s trying to keep his tone neutral, but I can feel the skepticism. I can’t blame him. It sounds insane.

 

“I know how it sounds, Eli,” I snap, but my voice wavers. “But Evelyn wrote about it in her journal. She saw it, too. There’s something wrong with that place.”

 

He pauses, his coffee cup halfway to his lips. “Look, I believe you, okay? You’re not… making this up. But are you sure it’s not just… I don’t know, your mind trying to fill in the gaps? You’ve been through a lot, and grief does weird things to people.”

 

“Maybe it is grief,” I say quietly, glancing out the window. “But if you’d seen what I saw… you’d understand why I can’t just ignore it.”

 

He sighs, setting his coffee cup down. “Fine. Let’s go back, then. Together. Just to prove to you there’s nothing there.” He says it like he’s trying to convince both of us.

That night, we set out. The forest is darker than I remembered, the trees looming taller, as if they’ve grown in the time since I last came here. The air feels thick, almost suffocating, and I can’t shake the sensation of being watched. The crunch of leaves and twigs underfoot is the only sound, and it feels obscenely loud in the stillness.

 

Eli’s flashlight sweeps across the path as we make our way closer to Mirror Pool. When we finally reach the clearing, the lake looks even more unnatural under the thin moonlight. The water is too still, reflecting the sky in a way that’s too perfect, like it’s waiting for us to step closer.

 

“You see?” I whisper, nodding toward the lake. “There’s something off. It’s like it’s not… real.”

 

Eli frowns, scanning the lake’s surface. “It’s just water, man.”

 

But I can see him tense as we approach the edge, his steps slowing as if he’s feeling the same unease. I take a deep breath and kneel, peering down at the water.

 

At first, it’s just us—our faces reflected in the glassy surface. But as I stare, my reflection begins to change. Her smile starts to creep onto her face again, lips curling upward into that same eerie, knowing grin. She tilts her head, as if she’s inviting me to come closer.

 

And then… her hand moves. It presses against the water’s surface from underneath, fingers curling upward as if she’s about to pull herself out. Her eyes are locked onto mine, filled with something dark, something hungry.

 

Eli’s face pales. “What… what is that?” he whispers, stumbling back. I can tell he sees it too.

 

Before I can respond, her hand breaks the surface, dripping with dark, murky water as it reaches toward us. She’s climbing out, her eyes fixed on me with that same smile, that same twisted expression of glee.

 

Eli and I stumble back, nearly falling as she reaches for us. My heart is pounding so hard I can barely hear anything else. I try to drag Eli back with me, but he’s frozen, his gaze locked on her as if he’s trapped.

 

“Eli!” I shout, and that seems to snap him out of it. We run, tearing through the woods, our footsteps echoing through the trees. I can feel her watching us, sense her lurking just behind, her voice a faint whisper that’s growing louder, repeating over and over.

 

“Come back… stay with me.”

 

I barely remember getting home. I stumble through the door, slamming it shut behind me, heart racing as I lean against it, trying to catch my breath. Eli follows a moment later, wide-eyed and silent.

 

“You saw it too, didn’t you?” I ask, my voice barely above a whisper.

 

Eli nods, his face pale. “It… it looked like you, but it wasn’t. That smile… God, that smile. What the hell is going on?”

 

I don’t have an answer. All I know is that she—whatever she is—wants something from me. And now that I’ve gone to the lake, now that I’ve seen her, she’s not going to stop.

That night, sleep is impossible. I hear her voice in every shadow, every creak of the floorboards, every whisper of wind outside my window. I cover every mirror, every reflective surface I can find, but it doesn’t matter. She’s there, lurking in the edges of my vision, her smile growing wider each time I look away.

In my dreams, she’s waiting by the lake, her hand outstretched, beckoning me forward. Her mouth moves, but her words are a distorted version of my own voice.

*“Come back… come home.”*

I wake up in a cold sweat, my heart hammering, and glance at the covered mirror by my bed. For a moment, I swear I see her silhouette in the darkness, her hand reaching toward me.

I don’t know what's going on. All I know is that going back there has made something much, much worse.",36,0.96,9,Important-Victory-25,2024-11-10 01:37:33,1gnvgsm,45,High
NoSleep,"Something possessed my body at 30,000 feet","It happened abruptly on a plane. 

I was woken up by some turbulence, and instead of going back to sleep, I stood up and demanded the nearest stewardess to bring me some sugar water. 

My voice was coarse, and I could feel every muscle tense across my body—as if I was preparing to do a backflip.

After crushing a Mountain Dew, I practically barked like a dog: “More! MORE SUGAR!”

It was terrifying.

Something awful had seized all executive functions of my brain—that’s the best way I could put it. It's like my consciousness got kicked out of the driver's seat, and was forced to watch everything from a cage.

I could still *see,* and *hear,* and *feel* every sensation in my body … I just had no input. No control over what I did.

“Mam, please calm down. We’ll get you some soda.”

“Sugar me, NOW!”

Horror quickly blended with embarrassment. I guzzled a dozen soft drinks in less than three minutes, which resulted in vomit all over my pants. People gasped, got up and moved away. I became ‘that woman’ on the plane.

“Do we have to restrain you mam?”

“Not if sugar I more have.”

\*\*\*

Instead of heading home towards my husband and two daughters in Toronto, I went straight to the travel counter to book a new flight.

“Lost. Angels.”

“Excuse me ma'am?”

“Plane me.”

“You'd like to book a flight to Los Angeles, is that right?”

Despite speaking in broken monosyllables, everyone was very willing to help.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m very thankful that I live in a very progressive, nice part of the world that somehow tolerates strange speech and vomit-stained pants, but for once I just wanted an asshole to call me out for a ‘random screening’.

I wanted someone to detain the insanity controlling my body. Instead, I helplessly watched my visa get charged a fortune.

First Class. Extra legroom. Next available flight.

\*\*\*

Upon arriving in California, a group of women dressed in very fancy blazers held out a sign for me. The sign said Simone. Which was my name.

The palest one wearing cat-eye sunglasses approached with a glossy-toothed smile. “Hello gorgeous. How was the flight?”

“Divine.” The Thing Controlling Me said.

“Good. Let’s freshen you up.”

*\*\*\**

In public, the women laughed and talked about fictional renovations. Everyone would take turns talking about ‘sprucing up their patio’ or how they were ‘building a yoga den’.

In private however, the women spoke in wet gagging noises—as if they were trying to make speech sounds not designed for human mouths.

The whole car ride from the airport, I was engulfed in drowning duck sounds. As a means of distraction (and potential escape), I tried to focus on what was being ‘squawked’, but that got me nowhere. The language was indecipherable. The one who wore a sunhat which obscured her eyes was honking at me especially. *“Hreeeonk”* she said,  pointing at me, over and over again. “Hreeeonk! Hreeeonk!”

The only consistency I could make out in their language is that whenever they spoke to the sunglasses leader, they would make the same double gagging sound. “Guack-Guack.”

And so, imprisoned in the backseat of my brain, I mentally started to make notes. 

* *The leader I will call ‘GG’.*
* *My name is … ‘Hreeeonk’ ?*

\*\*\*

As we swerved through a busier commercial district, GG slowed her driving, in fact, everyone in the minivan became quiet and started scanning the surroundings.

The car pulled over a curb, near a preacher who was proselytizing by a rack of pamphlets. He might have been a Mormon or a Jehovah's witness.

GG stepped out first, followed by what I would call her right hand loyalist— a woman who perpetually wore a violet scarf. 

From the crack of my window, I watched GG and Violet introduce themselves as fellow evangelicals. They said we were all going to a public prayer, and that we could use more preachers outside to attract attendees.

“That's very kind of you to invite me,” The man said. “ But I'm used to just sticking to my corner here.”

They insisted, and said it was all for the greater good, but the man still politely declined. 

“You should know something,” GG said, and took off her sunglasses. Something in her eyes had the man absolutely captivated. 

“We are angels. Sent by God.”

There was a pause. The preacher continued to stare without blinking. “You're … what?”

“And we're having a congregation.”

The car's windows rolled down, revealing our six woman crew. At this point I should mention that before I became bodysnatched (and even before I became a mom), I was a fashion model for many years.

In fact, all of these possessed women looked like idyllic models, with their long shiny hair and unblemished faces. We were basically a postcard for Sephora.

“You … “ The preacher gawked at all of us. “ You're angels?”

He didn't object when Violet grabbed his rack of brochures, and placed it in the trunk. And he also didn't object when GG led him into the passenger seat in front of me.

The car doors closed and we were off again in seconds. 

“So does this mean the end times are near?” He was visibly stunned. Laughing.

Violet, who sat beside me, secured a gold ring along her finger. A dart-like needle protruded from it.

“Something like that.”

She slinked an elbow over his shoulder and stabbed the ring into his neck.

“Ow! Hey! What’re you? What is that?”

Violet pulled away. “What? This? It’s Bulgari. Off Sak’s on Ventura.”

“Why does it burn?” The man clasped his wound, patting it as if it were on fire.  “Ahh! AAAAAAHHHH!”

After a few squirms and moans, he fell completely limp. All the women honked an aggressive nasal sound. A celebration. The Thing Controlling Me joined in, honking at full volume.

\*\*\*

The abandoned hotel they inhabited was somewhere between Los Angeles and Bakersfield. It was hard to be precise because my eyes weren't always looking out the window.

“Let me give you the grand tour,” Violet said, or at least that's what I assume the seal-like barking coming from her mouth meant.

The foyer was filled with flats upon flats of energy drinks. Monster, Red Bull, Rockstar, and dozens of other brands that all looked the same.

Our bedrooms looked all like normal hotel bedrooms. Except there were massive locks on the outside handles.

Violet also gave me a peek at the rooftop balcony patio—where I wish I could have averted my gaze, or closed my eyes, instead of staring right at the pile.

There were about two dozen bodies. Each one lifeless, each one dressed in very nice clothes, their ‘’Sunday best”. The preacher was dumped to the back half of the pile. The side with all the priests.

It reeked bad as some of the corpses were clearly decomposing, but The Thing Controlling Me wasn’t bothered by the smell.

Violet laughed her goose-honk laugh and took me downstairs.

\*\*\*

It was in the dining room where everyone stood in a circle, awaiting my arrival. 

Formerly, this must have been a space where they held buffets and parties, but now it was just a completely bare room with energy drinks and glass pipes on the floor. 

GG came up and handed me a four-pack of Guinness tall cans. The Thing Controlling Me proceeded to guzzle each one.

For the first time, my conscious state became fuzzy—the jet lag and sleep deprivation was finally catching up. I slowly brought myself to the floor.

The rest of them smiled and honked as my hands curled beneath my head. I fell asleep.

\*\*\*

A kick to the stomach woke me up. I rolled away and grimaced, staring at the black Prada heels worn by GG.

It was a full minute of reflexive dodging before I realized that it was now *me* who was crawling and sniveling.  The real me. *I* was moving my own limbs and shielding my face. *I* was shriveling up in a corner and screaming like a maniac.

“Please! Let me go! Please!!”

Somehow, when Thing Controlling Me fell asleep, I was able to take command again.

The honking entities surrounded my corner and nudged another frightened young woman towards me. I had never noticed her before because she had worn that massive sun hat that whole day.

It was Shula.

I was so caught off guard, I barely realized that I had control over my speech too.

 “... Shula?”

She used to work at the same modeling agency as me, and we often booked the same gigs because our skin tones were complementary. We even did a big eyeliner commercial for MAC once.

“You have to do everything … exactly as I say …”  Shula’s MAC eyeshadow now streamed down her cheeks.

She looked as sorrowful as I felt. 

“If you don’t listen  … they’ll only hurt us more.”

I stood up in my corner, eyeing the four other possessed humans. Their pupils were all dilated, probing me with intensity. 

“What? What do you mean?” I asked.

Shula’s head hung low. “This is your initiation. They want us to fight.”

“Fight?”

She stood up with reluctance and rolled back the sleeves of her oversized sweater. “We are going to have to make it look like I beat you up.”

“What? No. No no Shula. I’m not fighting you.”

“It’s not up to us. You have to do it.”

I wasn’t about to fight in some perverted boxing match. So I decided to run. I tried to bolt to my left, past Violet who was watching Shula. 

But the entity’s reflexes were too quick.

Violet seized my wrist and hurled me against the back of the room.

I slammed into a vinyl counter, breaking a nail, but miraculously, not my skull. By the time I stood up, the circle of women had surrounded me again.

“There’s no escape, Simone.” Shula curled both her fists, her sadness looked terrible and deep. “You need to fight. To show you're strong. Let's get it over with so they don't toss you.”

“Toss me?”

Shula nodded—fighting back tears.  “They've tossed bad picks before. Weaklings. So you have to put up a fight to show you're worthy. I don't want them to toss you.”

I looked at the counter behind me. It was adjoining a kitchen. 

I didn't know how long my free will would last, and I also didn’t know if I would ever have it again. I could have made many other decisions, but the mantra in my head was: *escape now or die trying.* Although their reflexes were quick, I thought maybe if I vaulted fast enough, I could grab a kitchen knife in time to properly retaliate.

So that's what I tried to do.

I flipped myself over into the kitchen. And this time, no one grabbed my wrist.

Scrambling off the linoleum floor, I shot past the fridge and industrial sink. I shot past the walk-in freezer and fryers.

But footsteps weren't far behind. By the time I reached another exit, someone grabbed my hair.

“You have to fight!” Shula screamed and dragged me to the ground. In seconds, I was pinned with a ladle against my throat.

She held a knee onto my stomach.

“That’s it. Just thrash around a little. It doesn't have to last long!”

I flipped her over and grappled her ladle, putting it on her own throat instead. Shula may have been taller, but she did not have tennis lessons with her kids.

“No! Simone! They can’t see you beat me!”

I pressed on the ladle like I was testing one of my rackets. I was single-minded in escaping, and if it meant I had to choke out my friend. Then that's what I had to do.

“You've got to stop! Plea… pl…

Her strength was fading, but I held on. It was only once her cheeks had turned blue, that I finally let go. 

GG bent over next to me with a smile. “Well done. What a fine vessel Ergic has chosen.”

My friend lay passed out on the floor. I stood with four smiling women who all smirked and patted my back.

\*\*\*

Flats of drinks were opened in the foyer. They handed me Rockstars like candy, honking and ululating in some kind of trance.

All the while, GG held on to my shoulder, not seeming to care that I was still Simone.  Her squeal-whispers felt like slugs entering my ear.

&nbsp;

*Snishak G’shak Ree*

*A new supplicant for thee*

*Snishak G’shak Gaul*

*Soon ours, one and all*

&nbsp;

During the chanting ceremony, Violet’s purple scarf was taken off her neck and then wrapped around my own.

The entities circled around me. They bowed and breathed at me, anointing me with their exhalations.

\*\*\*

GG took me to my room, and squawked to the entity inside me. I could feel it trying to wake up, playing a cerebral tug-of-war with my body.

Then GG looked me in the eyes without her sunglasses. She didn't have pupils like a normal human. She had the grid-like ommatidia of an insect.

“You are now Ergic’s tool, human. This is a high honor. Ergic is Vice-Praetor of the Old Ones.”

The Thing Controlling Me, or *Ergic*, had briefly seized control of my head and nodded.

GG put sunglasses over her eyes to speak to *me,* the real me, directly. “Cooperate with Ergic, and you will triumph. Resist, and we’ll toss you like the others. Understood?”

I didn't know what to say.

GG squeezed and held onto my cheek like I was some toy. Then she left without a word, and turned all six deadbolt locks.

\*\*\*

I wasn't certain, but I had a feeling that if I fell asleep, I would lose all control again. That Ergic would reassert himself. That’s why I was left here with more beer cans around me. They *wanted* me to doze off.

I had to stay awake.

There was a discarded laptop in the room. It was probably planted to test my allegiance or entrap me. But I didn't care. I used it to email my husband and people I trusted.

I told them I was taken hostage somewhere in California, and that needed their help. I told them my kidnappers were part of some bizarre cult.

But I didn't tell them about my possession, the preacher, or any of the crazy bodysnatching stuff. I didn't want them to think I was insane ... They would never believe me.

But hopefully you do. 

That's why I also posted this here.

If you live between Bakersfield and LA, and have ever driven past a pink, run down motel, please call the police. 

Send someone.

Save me.

Nick and I had to isolate ourselves. Not only because we had to stay up for 72 hours straight, but because we were scared we might spread what we had to others. Neither of us knew what this SORE thing might do to us, but if 72 hours of being awake was what was necessary to keep us and others from getting sick, we were gonna do it.

Luckily, the weekend was just around the corner. A couple of us had Memorial Day off. Nick managed to get a hold of Reggie, who could cover his shift in return for Nick taking a shift on Independence Day. Fair deal. So with a three-day weekend, we had our work cut out for us.

Caffeine was a given, but Nick also had to get some heavier stuff. The kinda thing that gets your heart racing to levesl it shouldn’t. I’m not gonna go into detail, but we needed a serious push to get past those last few hours. Remember; both of us had already been up for a full day when we first got exposed to this thing, so we were looking at almost four whole days, and no preparation.

 

We made the best of it. We played games, we ate takeout, we set new records on Nick’s old Guitar Hero games that he dug out of storage. The plastic guitars were a bit stiff and sun-yellowed, but they worked just fine most of the time. The green button would get a bit stuck though.

We went for walks, we took turns taking cold showers, we had a spontaneous karaoke thing going on in the living room… anything we could to keep the ball rolling and our eyes open. Sometimes I’d almost fall asleep standing up. Just leaning against a wall was bad enough. My knees would lock into place, and my body would slump a little. That’s when Nick would shake me back to life.

I had to get him a couple of times too. He once laid down face first on the couch, and I immediately flipped it over; almost wrecking his coffee table as he came tumbling down. It was stupid, but we had to be stupid to make it through this.

 

We’d been up for over 40 hours, and neither of us were making sense. We were out for a walk, hearing the frogs croak in the distance. The sun had just set, but we could still see the light peeking over the horizon. We tried to keep a good pace, but we could both feel it; we were slowing down. I had to keep us focused on something, so I brought up the first thing that came to mind.

“Your wife left you for a Salt Lake City stripper?”

“Yup,” Nick nodded. “Had the biceps and the stomach thing and all of it.”

“They still together?”

“What? No,” he laughed. “They were never together. But she tried, you know.”

“I’m not following.”

“She went for the guy. She called me up, said it was over, and went for the guy in this big, romantic hullabaloo.”

“And he blew her off?”

“He was gay,” Nick shrugged. “So it wasn’t really like that.”

 

Nick looked up, as if counting the stars. He sighed. The bags under his eyes looked darker than usual.

“I guess when you’ve seen the greener grass, everything else starts to look gross, right?”

“You ain’t gross, Nick. You’re just another kind of grass. Sorta… bluegrass, you know?”

“Bluegrass,” he chuckled. “I like that. Bluegrass kinda guy.”

 

Those last few hours, we ended up watching re-runs if Family Matters and chugging Four Loko. I had the Swedish Fish flavor. Nick knew a guy with boxes of the stuff. It was vile, but we had to get over those last few hours. Nick was pacing back and forth but was tired enough to almost fall over.

“Done,” Nick slurred. “I’m… I’m done. It’s just… it’s two hours.”

“You can do two hours,” I assured him. “You can do it.”

“I’m gonna go stick my head in the freezer.”

He did just as he said and stuck his head in the freezer. I was trying to keep up with the Winslows and their goofy adventures, but it was hard to pay attention. I had to fill in the blanks a lot, and it didn’t make a lot of sense. I barely registered the strange colors on-screen as Steve Urkel.

“You know what we can do?” Nick said. “We can… we can prep.”

“What do you mean?”

“We can … make it comfortable. I’m gonna make my bed with all new stuff, you can crash out here. And we get like… tea. And… ice water, for when we wake up. And I get, like… scented candles. And we put on whale song, and-“

“And we sleep like goddamn… royalty,” I added. “Right?”

“Yeah,” he nodded, getting more enthusiastic. “Yeah, that!”

 

So we got to work. Nick prepped his bed, and I went to his car to get a couple of extra blankets for the couch. Problem was, those were really soft blankets, and there was something about the back seat of his car that calmed me. Maybe the smell and feel of the synthetic leather. So I crawled in the back seat. There was a cold wind blowing, so I closed the door. And in that silence, I figured… what’s one hour? It’d just be an hour. Would that really be so bad?

And so, I crashed in the back seat of his car.

 

I was out for 14 hours. Nick got about 12. I woke up with a massive headache, but the ice water that Nick had prepped helped a little. I’d made us a couple of sandwiches. I thanked the past-us for thinking ahead, as the two of us prepped for work. By all metrics, we ought to have been fine. 72 hours had passed. Nick drove me to work – my car was still back at my place.

The conversation dulled as I chugged a full bottle of ice water, pouring the last few drops on my face. Nick looked like he’d been trampled by some kind of depressed parade. Even his hair looked tired.

“We’re not doing that again, “ I said.

“No, we’re not,” Nick agreed. “So we’re… we’re dropping this.”

I didn’t answer. I had pulled Nick into some bad shit one time too many. And yeah, the ends justify the means. I was looking for this lost girl, and I’d stumbled upon the very thing that got her lost in the first place. Nick looked over at me and sighed. He took a moment to choose his words.

“I get it,” he finally said. “You wanted to help. You still do. But let’s just… let’s think about it. Let’s be careful.”

“If you want me to back off, you gotta promise me something, Nick.”

He rolled his eyes, then looked at me. I wasn’t joking, and he could tell. With a sigh, he nodded.

“You gotta promise me that if you pick up any lead, whatsoever, on Adam’s missing girl – you’re telling me. You can call the shots, but there’s gotta be shots to call. I’m not the only one here to serve and protect, right?”

Nick tasted the words, throwing a glance in the rear-view mirror.

“Alright,” he said. “Deal.”

 

It took us a full work week to get back on our feet. My sleep schedule was a joke. One night I’d be in bed by six, another night I couldn’t sleep at all. I’d zone out at work, missing a word every now and then, much like I’d missed the story beats on Family Matters. I’d lag behind a bit, trying to piece together the context and make it make sense.

As I slowly got my routine back in order, May rolled into June. We started getting some proper heat. People were talking about a dry season, with no hint of rain for a long time to come. They weren’t wrong; there wouldn’t be a drop of water for two and a half weeks.

Midway through June, I was back on patrol duty. Charlie and Reggie were back to covering dispatch. Nick and I were on the same team, courtesy of a thankfully short conversation with sheriff Mason. I got the impression that the DUC were backing off – like some kind of situation had sort of resolved itself, seemingly.

 

I was on my way home from a particularly rough shift. A couple of tourists had tried to shoplift from the local grocery store. After resisting arrest and racking up two counts of obstruction, they managed to fail themselves all the way into a felony charge. Hysterical people were part of the job, but they were a shitty part of the job. But yeah, Tomskog doesn’t have a lot of those. It was nice to have something regular to do, for once.

Coming home from that shift, I felt like things were getting back to normal. The first drops of rain spattered against the hood of my car as I pulled into the driveway of my house. The moment I stepped outside, it felt like bliss.

The water was cooling. Reassuring, in a way. Like Mother Earth was whispering to me that things were gonna be okay. I just stopped for a second, put down my groceries, and basked in it. I found myself with my arms outstretched, and my mouth wide open – just drinking it all in.

I stood there for 35 minutes.

 

I’m not gonna lie, that was worrisome. Up until that point, I’d been fine. Could that one hour of SORE linger in your system that long? Could that be what caused it?

I tried to rationalize it, thinking I was overreacting. But in Tomskog, there’s no such thing as overreacting. If anything, people tended to shove life-threatening bullshit under the rug way too fast; myself included. So just to make sure, I gave Nick a call, explaining what I’d done.

“Yeah, that’s a symptom,” he said. “But I think some folks would just sort of stop at that, especially at the ass-end of things.”

“So it could mean that’s the last of it?” I asked. “Like it’s out of my system?”

“Sure, yeah. It could. It’s like when you get a bad cold. You get a runny nose, you get a headache, but that’s just your body fighting it off. This is sort of like that.”

“So what do I do?”

“Keep an eye on it. And if it gets worse, we do something.”

“Do what?”

Nick was quiet. I looked back at my still-packed groceries, pacing restlessly.

“Do what, Nick?”

“Something. I dunno.”

 

There were a couple of signs that things weren’t okay, but they were harder to spot than you might imagine. It is only later, when I looked back on this time, that I realized these weren’t really normal things.

For example, automatic doors stopped working. They’d close on me seemingly at random, as if they didn’t register that I was really there. It got annoying after a while, and I even got my foot stuck at one point.

Another thing was the water. No matter how hot I set the water to, it would end up going cold after a couple of seconds. I had to start taking really short showers. I called a plumber on two separate occasions, and both times they assured me that nothing was wrong.

Then there were the birds. There were just a handful of them, but I’d start to spot these bright red birds circling outside. They’d flee and scatter at the sight of me, but I’d never seen them before. They weren’t native to the area.

In and of themselves, these events would just be weird happenstances, but in the context of being exposed to something I didn’t understand – they had to be connected.

 

Then there was that one morning. I got to work, used the bathroom, and as I washed my hands I looked up to see my reflection. As I did, I watched it turn to ash.

The skin looked like it sagged off my face and evaporated into dust, leaving a blackened charcoal-like skull behind. Empty sockets leaving a dead, empty stare. I tried to blink it away, but the image wouldn’t disappear. I would turn my head, and as I did, the reflection would do the same; until decay caused the skull to detach and roll off the shoulder.

As it did, the light flickered. There was a sound. I expected a thud, but it was something darker, more rumbling. Like a drawn out…

***‘ H E L L O ‘***

 

I ran out, grabbed Nick by the arm, and got out of the station. I got a lot of weird looks that day, but I’d started to get a bit of a reputation as a wild card anyway. At least I wasn’t just a rookie. Nick pulled himself free, looking me up and down. It took him a couple of seconds to soften his expression.

“It’s getting worse?” he asked.

“Yeah,” I said. “A lot.”

“Look, the only one I can think of that would know something about this is Digman, and that fucker…”

“What?” I said. “Don’t we have guys on surveillance?”

“He’s been gone for weeks. Suspected dead.”

“Dead?!” a scoffed. “How are we not talking about this?!”

“It’s not been confirmed or anything,” Nick shrugged. “There’s no body.”

“So what the hell do we do then?!”

Nick paced a little, adjusting his pink sunglasses. Looking back at the station, I could see we had a bit of an audience.

“We could get the DUC,” I suggested. “They study this, right?”

“You’d go away,” Nick said, shaking his head. “Permanently.”

 

Nick looked around, as if expecting to see an answer in our immediate vicinity. Either that, or he was having trouble keeping eye contact.

“I don’t know,” Nick said. “There’s this one thing that’s sort of a cure-all kinda deal, but it’s just… it’s dumb. Real dumb. Like, actual dumb.”

“Nick, I gotta… what are you suggesting?”

“Look, if you can hold on, and I’m not suggesting anything else, you could, technically-“

“For fuck’s sake Nick, spit it out.”

He rolled his eyes, and he threw out his arms in surrender.

“You could do a Yearwalk. Same thing as Digman. You would have to make it ‘til New Years, and then a *whole other year*, but I’ve seen it done. It’s an absolutely insane thing, but it can do anything.”

“When you say anything, what *exactly* do you mean?”

 

Nick lowered his glasses and his voice.

“It can literally bring the dead back to life. I’d bet my life that it could wipe away whatever shit you got in your system.”

“That’s like… chopping off your neck ‘cause you got a headache.”

“I’m just sayin’,” Nick clarified. “There’s always a backup plan.”

 

Things would escalate from there. The next time it rained, just a couple of days later, I lost one and half hours. I stepped outside and blacked out, waking up with a mouthful of rainwater.

I started having nightmares. I’d have no idea what about, I’d just wake up with a cold sweat and a heart pounding panic. I knew it was bad, but I didn’t know why. Sometimes, there’d be bruises.

And this one time, I woke up with an awful stomach cramp.  I rushed to the bathroom, thinking I had indigestion, when I tripped on the threshold. I landed stomach-first on the bathroom tiles, and there was this fullness in my throat that just spurted out. I coughed up about half a dozen thin white strings.

 

It was just the end of them; they were still attached to me. I could feel them moving in my throat. I tried pulling them out, but the cramp sent this shockwave of pain through me; like the strands had roots in my gut. It felt like pulling them out might kill me.

I got up off the floor and grabbed some nail clippers. Taking a single strand, I clipped it off. I got this intense pain in my chest, like my heart didn’t know what to do. It felt like I’d been stabbed, or lost a tooth. There was this sharp, cutting pain, curling all the way from my throat down to the base of my spine. I just stood there, having these white strands hanging from the edge of my lips; like I’d swallowed a cheap wig.

There was only one option. I leaned my head back and slowly, but surely, swallowed. I spent the better part of an hour on that bathroom floor, clutching my stomach. I thought about getting in the shower, but it’d just be too cold. A single dead strand of white lay in the sink, stinking of chlorine and ammonia. It was so acidic that it discolored the ceramic with a tinge of blue.

 

Later that night, I spent time going through Adam’s notes. The man had been researching SORE for some time, and although his notes made little sense, I figured there might be something in there that I’d missed.

Flipping page, after page, after page, I lulled myself into this semi-hypnotic state. Hand-written notes took ages to read. The notes were mostly focused on what he thought his daughter Elizabeth had been exposed to, but he was making an attempt to piece together info about the condition itself as well.

And that was the scariest thing; it was never a disease, or an infection. It was a *condition*. Every page all but confirmed that SORE didn’t destroy or introduce anything to the body. It escalated something we already contained. It meant that whatever effect SORE was triggering had a universal component *already present* in every single human. And, according to Adam’s notes, a handful of other creatures. Lions, most notably, and certain kinds of fish.

 

Falling asleep over the notebooks, I barely even read anymore. I just saw the pages flip. But there was something off. I was holding my head up with my left hand and checking my phone with my right.

So how was I turning the page?

 

Something cold retracted down my throat. It felt like swallowing a sort of tasteless, gelatinous yoghurt. Soft, boneless, and chunky.

I fell out of my seat, tapping my body. My chest, my stomach, my head. I was okay. I wasn’t even nauseous. But my heart was racing like a steam engine, and I could feel a strange weight in the pit of my stomach. Like I was full, but without eating. Something was pressing against my organs; albeit ever so gently.

 

I picked up the phone and called Nick. I ran into my bathroom, looking at myself in the mirror. I looked normal. I was okay.

“…yeah?” Nick answered.

“It’s worse,” I huffed. “It’s so much worse.”

“I can be there in… fifteen.”

“Please.”

“Are you gonna tell me what’s-“

 

I made this ungodly noise, like I was bracing for a sneeze. But instead of a sneeze, I felt something rooted in my stomach shoot itself out of my throat. A white tentacle-like appendage slapped my phone out of my hands, sending it across the room.

The reflection in the mirror was still standing as I fell to the floor. It was turning to ash, and reaching its hands towards the appendage; almost like a greeting, or an invitation. The two reached towards one another. I grasped the thing coming out of my throat, but it was slippery. It felt like trying to strangle a soap.

I couldn’t think straight. What was I even fighting? What was happening to me?

 

Rushing towards the door, I caught a final glimpse of that reflection. It wasn’t just a decaying me reaching out; there was something behind it. Something impossibly dark, guiding its arm. Like a tutor teaching a pupil. It reminded me of how my mom had stood behind me at the shooting range when I was a teenager. A memory that, up until that point, had been nothing but positive.

Crashing through the door, I stumbled through the living room, dragging the exposed white appendage behind me like an unfriendly dog on a leash. I tried leaning my head back and swallowing, forcing it back down my throat, but I just ended up gagging on air. It was straining itself, testing the roots in the pit of my stomach. It struggled, knocking over a couple of chairs as it twitched and slithered back and forth on the floor.

I leaned back against the wall, bracing myself to pull. It was gonna hurt like hell, but I had no choice.

Then, I accidentally hit the light switch.

 

All of a sudden, it retracted. It rolled back down my throat like a measuring tape, snapping hard enough that it tapped the tip of my noise going down. Kinda like the spaghetti scene in Lady and the Tramp; another memory forever spoiled by that nightmarish thing.

I waited by the door, in the light. I didn’t know what to do. I was getting worse by the day, and there was no doubt in my mind that it was a SORE thing anymore. There’d been illustrations in Adam’s notebooks. Descriptions. Hell, I’d seen the thing burst out of him that night in May; just before Nick and I killed him and set fire to his remains.

I was screwed. There was no other way to say it. Going to the DUC would put everyone under investigation, and I’d be gone. Staying with Nick could mean infecting others.

 

When Nick pulled up, I walked out the door and held up a hand. I had no idea what I was gonna do or say, but I couldn’t put him in danger again. SORE could spread at minimum contact, and there was no way I could control it. I had no idea if a sneeze or light touch could infect him. I had to keep my distance.

“You okay?” he asked, stepping out of the car.

“You, uh… you got anything?” I asked. “Any solutions?”

“Not yet,” he admitted. “But I think our best bet is to go hunting for Digman. They say he’s gone, but… he’s a slippery shit. I don’t think he could die if he wanted to.”

“Yeah, yeah,” I nodded. “Sounds good.”

“You, uh… you don’t look okay,” Nick blurted out. “I mean, you got that heroine chic thing going on, but it’s like… more heroin than chic.”

“I’ll be good, Nick.”

 

There was something about my tone made him quiet down. We looked at one another in silence, considering the weight of our words.

“It’s real bad, huh?”

“Uh-huh,” I nodded.

I looked down. Usually, Nick could fix things. He could help me, or I could help him. But this time, my partner was as helpless as I was.

“I think you should go, Nick,” I said. “You can get sick.”

“Fuck that.”

“I’m serious, Nick.”

He looked at me with his arms crossed. I hadn’t even noticed how he hadn’t brought his trademark pink sunglasses.

“What are you gonna do?” he asked.

“I dunno,” I shrugged. “But you gotta go. I can’t… I can’t control it.”

“Are you asking or telling me?”

“I’m asking.”

 

He bit his lip, putting his hands at his sides. He wanted to say something else, but he couldn’t. He just gave me this look, like he was asking me to reconsider. I just shook my head at him.

He reluctantly got back in his car. And to his credit, he did as I asked. He left.

I packed some things. Mostly notebooks, some clothes, and cash. I locked the place up, got in my car, and drove. I couldn’t stick around where I might hurt someone. At the end of the day, it was still about protect and serve.

 

I tried not to look in the rear-view mirror, or the side mirrors. It felt like something was off, like they weren’t really showing me what they should. There was that feeling that a tiny tilt would show me something I didn’t want to see.

I’d have to blink away things that weren’t there. I’d see shapes lining the side of the road. I’d feel something in my stomach twist and turn, as if commanded by something to act. I bit down hard, making sure my teeth touched, and put a hand in front of my mouth.

But it didn’t help for long. Something tickled my nose instead.

 

I remember thinking ‘no’. That’s all I was thinking. Streetlights were passing me by as I sped up. As I got further out of town, the streetlights made way for worse and worse dirt roads, leading me into spaces the Tomskog folks rarely went. I didn’t really think about it. If that ‘s what it was gonna be, that’s what it was gonna be.

I’d see humanoid shapes on the sides. Darkened, charcoal-like things, like the decay I’d seen looking back at me in the mirror. I could taste the sourness in my mouth as something struggled to be freed, and I could see things moving in the mirrors at the edge of my peripheral. I was doing something *it* didn’t want, and it was gonna let me know. It wanted to be around people. It wanted to meet others. Fuck that.

My car shook. Even with a seat belt, I smacked my head against the roof of the car as I hit a rock. I almost lost my steering. I had to pull the hand brake, coming to a full stop.

 

As my body shot forward, the car screeched to a halt. The second my body thumped against the seat belt, little white strands shot out of my whole face. A tickle in my eyes and nose. Something between my teeth. Something running out of my ears like a bad ear wax. The strands were almost two feet long now, scattered across the dashboard, moving independently of one another.

Chlorine and ammonia. The smell was overwhelming, and for a moment, I just sat there. I was afraid to move, thinking I was a sudden jerk away from excruciating pain. I slowly pulled my head back and turned the car off. I just sat there with my face feeling like a leaking lemon. Was this the end stage? Was I about to lose my mind, like Adam had?

I looked up to see my reflection in the rear-view mirror. It hurt when I blinked. Little strands of white were moving my eyelashes, forcing me to blink over and over. I was expecting to see some horrific vision, but all I saw was myself.

That was bad enough.

 

Looking out into the dark, I could see silhouettes. Things as dark as decay, moving closer. An army, asking me to join. Something horrible, and primal, bringing out the worst in me; making it spill out like an overflowing bowl.

I got out of the car and brought my flashlight. If light messed with these things, I’d mess with them all the way to my grave. I kept going down the broken dirt road by foot, desperate to get as far away as possible. I saw an old sign saying ‘St. Gall’, but I had no reference to what that might mean. There was no place on the map with that name. Maybe I was just distracted. I think I’d heard it mentioned a couple of times.

My light would land on things. Things peeking out behind trees. Things moving in the grass. Distant whispers. Interested parties taking note.

 

A drop of blood ran from my nose. I was having trouble concentrating. I couldn’t remember the name of the Winslows anymore. Did I even like Family Matters? Was that even a TV-show?

I fell to my knees. I couldn’t keep up with thinking and moving at once, so I settled for thinking. I sat there on my knees, confounded and confused. I didn’t even notice me turning the flashlight off; embracing the dark.

 

I remember looking up and seeing something massive coming towards me. It didn’t make a sound. It was just this presence; hollow and immense. When it finally spoke, it was as if spoken from behind a pane of glass. Resonating, vibrating. Trying to break through.

***‘ H E L L O ‘***

I waved back, one finger at a time, like I was drumming on an invisible dashboard.

“Hello,” I said.” How… how are you?”

 

It reached for me, and the things inside me reached back. Like extending for a handshake. Someone welcoming an old friend. A promise of something horrible to come. I was just the broken shell of a snail, waiting to be replaced. White strands raised themselves out of me. Something large adjusted itself, causing me to almost tip over.

I tried pulling back, but there was no point. Not only was I exhausted, but I didn’t understand what I was fighting against. But I remember laughing out loud. Because, despite knowing I was about to die, that something would be torn from me, a thought crossed my mind.

Carl. *Carl Winslow* was the dad on Family Matters.

And in that moment, I knew that this thing hadn’t really won. Not yet. I could still think.

 

I gathered whatever thoughts I could muster and directed it into a tiny little movement. I twitched my thumb, and the flashlight came back on. I’d been holding it on the ground, and it lit up my face like I was a kid telling a scary story.

My face burned as it retreated into me, like a rabbit diving for its burrow. I was left with these chemical streaks across my face, and this awful tickle in my throat. But for a brief moment, there was nothing there. It was just a nice summer night, with frogs croaking in the distance, and the stars as bright as ever.

 

“Miss, are you harmed?”

I turned around to see someone coming down the road. A nice-looking woman in a blue kaftan.

She got closer, and I wanted to keep my distance; but I physically couldn’t. I can’t imagine what I must’ve looked like. And yet, this woman stopped about six feet away and sat down. She didn’t seem the least bit bothered.

“You… you should go,” I said. “Don’t get… get sick.”

“I will not get sick,” she said. “So that is not going to be a problem.”

“You could… get sick,” I mumbled. “I… it? I could get… it could kill.”

“No no no,” she smiled. “That will not be an issue.”

She got up, scooched closer, and sat across from me. I tried to crawl back, but I couldn’t get my arms to move. SORE was reaching into my brain. I could feel it. I could hear the roots crackling as they physically wrapped around my brain stem. It wouldn’t let me control myself again.

 

“Did you come here to get help?” she asked.

“No, to… to…  away. Don’t… sick.”

“Really? Even now, that is what you are thinking about?”

“Don’t… don’t get…”

I couldn’t finish my sentence. My head hung low, as a weight fell on my neck. She put her hand on my chin and lifted me up to look at her.

 

“Look, sweetie,” she said. “I can not tell a lie. So what I am saying is not just comfort, it is what is going to be, understand”

I tried to nod at her, but I couldn’t.

“This thing will not kill you,” she continued. “It will not control you. You will not infect anyone. I promise, that is not gonna happen. It can not happen.”

She wiped a tear from my eye with her thumb. My tear was a light blue.

“You will feel better in the morning,” she smiled. “Here. And try to remember the nice human lady with the kaftan who helped you, yes?”

She handed me a handkerchief, gave me a kiss on the cheek, and wandered off down the road. I closed my eyes, listening for her footsteps to disappear.

 

I must’ve sat there for hours. All night.

At the crack of dawn, I found myself still sitting in the middle of the road, clutching a handkerchief with a little blue sunflower on it. My legs had long since fallen asleep. I was hungry and tired. Dirty as all hell. I could feel something dried on my face, leaving scabs and flakes to be picked off. I closed my eyes, testing myself to see if I was really okay.

I thought about the show Family Matters again. It was a good measuring tape. Carl Winslow was the dad. Harriette was the mom. Laura and Eddie were the kids. Then, I couldn’t help but laugh.

“Urkel,” I chuckled. “Steve fucking Urkel.”

It was all there. All the little bits and bobs from the back of my mind. I was really feeling better, like the lady had said I would.

 

I don’t know how she did it, or why. I could still feel something inside, but I was in control. I could keep it down. I could breathe, and there was no pain. Not even a threat of pain.

“It won’t kill me,” I muttered. “It won’t infect.”

I don’t know how to describe it. I believed her. It felt true. I don’t know how it could be, but it was. I was certain of it.

 

I stumbled my way back to my car, closed the door, and put on my seat belt. There were these splashes of blue across the dashboard from where the white strands had touched. I must’ve been hours, maybe minutes away from falling under the influence of that thing, like Adam. But where he’d lost his mind, I’d gotten a strange second wind.

Maybe it was like Nick had said, that it was just the ‘sickness’ taking its course. But I don’t think that’s it. I think what saved me that night was a chance encounter with a woman from St. Gall.

First thing I did was call him. It just took two signals.

“It’s… I’m better,” I said. “I think it’s gonna be okay.”

“You fixed it?”

“Kinda.”

“How?”

“There was a lady, and…”

I looked down at the handkerchief with the blue sunflower and laughed a little at myself. It was such a stupid moment, but it was so relieving.

“… and Steve Urkel, I guess.”

“Are you fucking *drunk?*”

“I’m sure as hell gonna be.”

 

I hung up and watched the Minnesota sun come up over the horizon. I’d made it through the night. There might be more trouble down the road, but for now, I was okay.

But in that moment, I just had to sit for a while. Strange how I can’t, to this day, picture what that lady really looked like. I know she was a nice lady with a blue kaftan, but there’s like… no detail. There’s nothing really there. It’s just the words, and what I remember feeling.

But that don’t make me any less thankful.",80,0.96,13,Saturdead,2024-11-09 11:02:12,1gnekus,93,High
NoSleep,The Humming in the woods,"I’m taking to the internet to hopefully find someone else with a similar experience and maybe someone who can explain it.

A few weeks ago some friends and I decided to go on a a camping trip. 

The first time I heard the humming was when we got to the entrance booth to the park. It was a low hum, almost guttural and without a source. Like the fog around me was choking the forest of its voice.

The window to the hut slid open, and a friendly woman greeted us. The conversation was filled with your basic pleasantries, but behind her, there was a tall man, another ranger I presumed, but he was facing away from us all, staring out the exit window on the other side. We checked in and drove off to the parking area, where the humming finally disappeared. We quickly unpacked and walked the mile to our secluded campsite, far from the drive-up campers. The nearest campfire was just a distant flicker. It was perfect—just us and the woods.

As the sun began to set, we had our tents up, s’mores were being made, and the fresh air of the woods filled our lungs. Deep breaths and sighs were constantly heard as the weight of our everyday life fell off our shoulders.

That first night, I woke up with a minor headache. I lay still, listening to the breeze—and then I noticed it again. The humming, faint and constant, barely beneath the wind, made my stomach twist. As I tried to focus on it, my eyes began to shut, and the next thing I knew, I was waking up again to what I could only assume was morning.

The sky was overcast, dull. The forecast didn’t call for rain, so if that was all we got, I counted myself lucky. My headache was gone, and even while looking for it, I couldn’t hear that humming anymore. Feeling much better, we ate a quick breakfast and had a short midday hike.

During that hike was my third encounter with this humming. Standing on an overlook with a view of a few hills, I caught sight of what I thought was that same ranger I saw from the booth. The one standing behind the lady. Once again, he was turned away from me, across the valley. I couldn’t make out any distinct features besides the clothes, but I remember that as soon as I saw him, the humming started. I immediately began to feel ill again, and that damn humming just kept getting louder the longer I stared. He was still. So still. No movement, almost as if he was a sculpture amongst the trees.
I snapped out of the stupor of tunnel vision I was in when my friend choked while trying to drink water of all things, and they braced themselves on me for dramatic effect.

“Wrong pipe,” they squeezed out of their throat with lost breath. I looked back to find the man, and no one was there.

Our final night, we stayed up late around the campfire. I finally brought up the humming. No one else had heard it. It was only me. Feeling a little crazy, I recounted the day’s events and mentioned seeing the ranger from the booth across the valley.

“Honestly, that would be my go-to job if I could start over,” said my partner.

Aaron lit up. “Do you think she gets to drive those sweet off-road go-karts to get across all this land?”

“Oh, I meant the guy behind the lady from the booth.” I corrected

“What guy?”

Beth’s voice rose with curiosity. “I’m pretty sure it was just the girl in that booth. I remember thinking, damn, they got her out here alone?”

“Maybe it was someone on the other side of the booth?” my partner added.

I was silent. The only thing that came to my mind was a solemn “maybe” as I questioned my own memory and, honestly, my sanity at this point.

When the night set in, we repeated our s’more ritual and laid down. Trying hard to push the thought of the ranger out of my head only made me think about him more. Late in the night, it struck again. Like a needle going into my ear, the humming started, and my head immediately began to hurt. It sounded so much closer. I got up with the excuse of needing to use the restroom, but I wanted to find where this was coming from.

I took the flashlight and walked out in the direction that felt the most correct. This humming didn’t seem to have a direction; it just existed. From all around me. The further I walked into the woods, the louder it got. I didn’t want to get too far from camp, so I made the conscious decision to turn around so I couldn’t get lost. The humming suddenly got worse and made me keel over. It didn’t just feel around me; it felt inside my head like a balloon slowly inflating behind my eyes, pushing against my skull. Permeating my thoughts. I became dizzy.

I saw what appeared to be the ranger about 15 feet away. The fog was so thick, and he was so still that I must have thought he was a tree at first and didn’t notice him, but no. This was the ranger I had seen earlier. I managed to blurt out a single, “Hey,” but no response was returned.
The humming became louder, and if it hadn’t been for my obsession with who this was, I would have just walked away. I crept around the figure, my unsteady hand moving the light up his body. Tattered, mud-ridden boots. Old, shredded pants. I began to stutter on nothing when the light revealed dark, red stains leading up his shirt. Terrified, I couldn’t look away.

I saw a hanging bit of flesh in front of his neck. It took my mind a moment to understand what I saw: his tongue, hanging. His bottom jaw was gone, leaving only a row of upper teeth and a gnarled mess of tongue and flesh hanging beneath it. Before I could wrestle myself from the fear that strangled me, I saw his eyes. Empty, sunken dark holes stared back. They seemed to reach out, trying to pull my eyes out to fill the space where his should have been. I couldn’t speak. Barely a breath could escape me.

I immediately felt tears welling up as I realized the humming finally had a creator. This thing was humming, almost growling. After every detail was burned into my mind, I ran back to camp. But I quickly realized he didn’t chase me. The more I thought about it, he maybe didn’t even know I was there.

I made it back to camp with wet eyes, out of breath, and tried to get out any coherent word to explain what I saw, but it was all a panicked, panted mess. We all walked back to the car together and sat there until sunrise. I could not sleep. We went back to the site to gather our things, and not a single hum was heard. As we pulled out of the campgrounds, we passed right by the booth, and I looked in the mirror to see if the man was there again. He wasn’t,

If I could go back and find him then I’ll know it was real. I feel crazy. Like I can’t even trust what I’m writing here but it felt so real. But going crazy is the only explanation I can think of as no one else heard the hum or saw the man but maybe someone else out there has and I can get some consolation on the internet. What should I do?

I think I’ve obsessed over it too much. My partner has even told me I’ve begun to hum in my sleep.",25,0.97,1,Handle-Personal,2024-11-09 13:32:17,1gnhx2p,26,High
NoSleep,"For my 12th birthday, my dad surprised me with two real life mermaids.","I'm currently completely at a loss what to do. 

I (21f) have just escaped my parents, after finding something horrifying in my dad’s beach house. 

I've always loved mermaids.

Yes, I was one of those kids obsessed with everything mermaid—whether that was TV shows, movies, books—any marine-related media, really, but mermaids especially.

I loved everything about the sea, about water, until I almost drowned on my fifth birthday. 

So, with a newfound fear of even dipping my toes in the shallows, I became fascinated with fake water instead. 

Mom called it a mental illness. (I can see where she was coming from, considering I asked for every pool or water-related game ever made.) But I was just a kid.

I preferred water to land, and even terrified of it, I still wanted to submerge myself in it, imagining a whole other world. 

I barely remember almost drowning, only the contorting fear twisting inside me and swallowing me up, the inability to speak, my voice cruelly torn away, my breath stolen as I sank further into the abyss—also known as the deep end of our neighbor’s pool. 

Mom said I didn’t realize it was that deep since I was used to our own pool.

There I was, sitting on the edge with my legs swinging and a plate of birthday cake in my hands, when I had the bright idea to show the adults how cute I was. 

This is my mom’s retelling, so it's probably exaggerated, but apparently, I dropped headfirst into the pool, cake and all, and sank straight to the bottom. 

Dad dove in after me, pulling me back to the surface, dragging me from the shallows. 

But it was too late.

I was screaming, hysterical, backing away from the pool like it was filled with lava. 

The crazy thing is, I remember this exact feeling. I remember staggering back, the ice-cold breeze tickling my cheeks feeling wrong compared to the warmth of the water that was supposed to protect me. 

The ice cold concrete of my neighbor’s patio felt *wrong*. 

Land felt wrong. 

The water, that had almost killed me, felt *right*, and I could never understand why. 

Instead of caressing me, this cruel underwater world had dragged me down, down, down, squeezing my lungs and stealing my air, crushing instead of cradling me. I avoided water and didn’t go near any pool after that, even ours; the very one I used to spend every spare hour splashing around in. 

When Mom tried to bathe me, I insisted on the water being ankle-deep, with her using a cup to rinse my hair as I tilted my head back, squeezing my eyes shut. 

According to Mom, I would scream until my throat was raw if there was too much water. 

Even washing my hands and brushing my teeth, I remember timing the flow just right, so I could stick my toothbrush or soapy hands under, count three elephants, and then dive out of the bathroom. I flooded the floors on multiple occasions when I forgot to turn off the faucet. 

But still, somehow, I was fascinated with water itself. 

I loved how it was still, how it ran and trickled and filled my cupped hands…. 

According to Mom, I told my therapist I wanted to be a fish.

However, my therapist had a sort of resolution. She leaned forward and grabbed my hands, squeezing them tight. 

*“Okay, Sadie, well, if you're scared of real water, why don’t you try fake water?”*

Which, I guess, is how my mermaid obsession started.

My therapist started me with little kids’ games about solving puzzles underwater—and immediately, I was hooked. 

Through my fascination with digital water, I found mermaids—beautiful, human-like fish people who could breathe underwater, living in vast, towering cities deep, deep under the sea. 

I watched every Little Mermaid, bingeing mermaid-themed movies and TV shows. 

By the age of nine, I was fully convinced I was actually a mermaid, and touching water would magically transform my legs into a tail.

It didn’t, obviously, so I did what any supposedly mentally ill nine-year-old would do. I swallowed two teaspoons of salt mixed with tears of terror before sticking my head underwater for ten seconds.

Again, nothing happened.

But I was starting to slowly overcome my fear of being submerged in water, so I lowered myself onto the stairs in the shallow end of our pool and forced myself to get used to it.

I was still acclimating when my brother shoved my head under, quickly reminding me of that sensation—the squeezing of my chest, the inability to breathe, choking on bubbles exploding around me. After that, Dad insisted on teaching me how to swim. 

Like me, he’d always been fascinated with water, so he refused to have a child who couldn’t swim. Before my older brother and I were even born, he enrolled us in lessons. Harvey was five years older than me, so he could already swim. Dad wanted to take me to the sea, though I was more comfortable in the pool.

However, my swimming classes were short-lived (I barely learned how to keep my head afloat) when Dad left in the middle of the night and never came back. But… neither did my brother.

I woke up around midnight to Mom hysterically crying. I discovered the next morning that Dad had taken my brother hookah diving without proper equipment, and Harvey was in the emergency room. 

Initially, I was told my brother was very sick, which, obviously, I believed. 

I was playing Sonic with my brother only yesterday! In my head, he was just sick in the hospital.

I spent the day expecting him to drag himself into my bedroom at any time, knock something over, call me a name, and run away. But the house was empty. 

Mom didn't come out of her room. 

Not even to take me to school. Instead, I watched Cartoon Network all day. I poked my head in my brother’s room, and it was a noticeable mess, clothes strewn everywhere and a half-packed suitcase.

When I asked to see Harvey a few days later, Mom told me he was dead.

Brain-dead, at least.

She explained it the best she could, choking on her own words.

Harvey had gone too deep, and when trying to resurface, his blood had bubbles and his brain had popped.

I don’t think she was mentally okay enough to explain to her nine-year-old daughter that her brother was dead. 

Yeah, no, considering she used our soda stream and a grape to demonstrate the accident with a hysterical smile on her mouth, almost like she thought it was funny. I didn't find it funny. 

Watching the bubbles in the water and my mother pop a grape between her index and thumb with a huge grin on her face was actually fucking traumatising. 

I know people grieve in their own way. Even as a kid though, I was confused when my brother didn’t get a funeral. 

Dad did come back, but only to try and justify his trip with Harvey. He said it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that he was just doing what was best for his kids.

I already despised him for taking my brother away, but the way he talked about him, insisting that “Harvey loves the water!” made me want to scream. 

He was *wrong.* While I was obsessed with water, my brother had steered away from it, especially the sea. Mom called him a psycho and threw him out.

Dad moved to the other side of town, and it was just Mom and me once again.

For a long time, I hated my father. I ignored his letters, calls, texts, and the mermaid figurines he sent me for my birthday. I didn’t understand grieving, and worse, post-grieving.

Did such a thing exist? 

I understood that I was sad, and sometimes I was happy—before feeling guilty for catching myself smiling. 

I missed him, so I got a diary. I wrote to my brother, telling him everything and nothing, sometimes just what I did that day, or telling him how mom was.

I started attending group therapy. 

One girl said she forgave her father for killing her mother in a car crash but her words became entangled in my mind, frustrating me, bleeding into confusion and anger I  couldn't control. 

How could she forgive something like that? I asked her after, and she shrugged and said, “It wasn't his fault.” 

“But it *was* my dad’s fault,” I told her, leaning forward in my chair. “He killed my brother.”

The girl, Mia, I think her name was (I could never read her name-tag– it was either Mia, or Mira) folded her arms, shooting me a glare. “Well, maybe you should forgive him.”

When I asked Mom in the car on the way home, she said the exact same thing. 

“It was an accident, Sadie,” Mom said. “Your father took your brother diving, and he wasn't ready.” She averted her gaze, her hands tightening around the wheel. “Harvey asked him to take him out during a storm.”

Something ice cold trickled down my spine. “But you said—”

She said Harvey didn't want to go diving.

There wasn't a storm that night. I would have heard it.

She said my brother hated the ocean, and he wanted no part of it.

Mom’s eyes darkened, and she opened her mouth like she was going to speak, before changing the subject, flicking on the radio. “Do you want to get takeout tonight?”

I wanted to question her, but I didn't even know what to ask.

But then I was questioning my own memories.

Did Mom say what I remembered, or did I mishear her?

It took me a long time to realize maybe Harvey's death wasn't Dad’s fault after all.

After a while of therapy, and listening to other kids’ stories, I started to wonder if hating him was the right thing to do. 

Mom was talking to him civilly, at least. The two of them met for coffee every Saturday, and Mom seemed like she had genuinely forgiven him. 

The other kids asked me if my Mom was *over* Harvey’s death. But I guess laughing was inappropriate. “Grieving is an individual emotion!” Mr. Prescott, our therapist, kept saying, when I was on my knees giggling into the prickly carpet. 

Was my mother over my brother’s death? *Yes, of course she was!* 

That's what I told my friends, who I made sure stayed far away from our house. 

Mom was *fine*, I told everyone. 

She was completely fine, and definitely *not* slowly losing her mind, insisting on buying a giant aquarium for her room and named her new pet flounder fish Harvey. 

*Mom isn't crazy*, I told myself, which became my mantra. 

She just had her own way of grieving. 

Besides, I did like Harvey. 

He was pretty cool for a fish, always waiting for me behind the glass when I got home from school. 

*Mom isn't crazy.*

That's what I told myself (again) when I caught her opening the tank and trying to fish Harvey out of the water to hold him. Unlike other fish though, he didn't freak out or squirm, instead staying cupped in her hands. 

So, no, I finally admitted to my therapy class, bursting into tears. 

Mom definitely *wasn't* over my brother. I was eleven years old, and my mother was on the brink of a breakdown. 

She worked all day every day, and on weekends all she talked about was either work, or Harvey the fish, often pausing so *he* could join in conversations.

Sometimes, she asked him, “How's school?” 

I had to quietly remind her that the fish wasn't actually my brother. 

I needed something– someone– normal. 

I found ‘normal’ in the family pool, enveloping myself in my comfort zone. 

Over the years, I taught myself how to swim, envisioning my tail again. 

In my mind, I could swim away from my family, and never go back. 

Unfortunately, I was old enough to know mermaids weren't real.

The only connection I *did* have with the ocean was with Harvey.

Dad called every day inviting me to visit. 

I always declined. I wasn't interested in his shiny new life. Dad was an architect, and had designed his own house by the sea. 

I ignored him until my twelfth birthday, when he sent a text which just said, **“Happy Birthday, pumpkin! I have a surprise for you, but you're going to have to come see it yourself. Our door is always open, Sadie. You're going to love them!”**

I wasn't exactly ecstatic. 

Dad’s new girlfriend, who was half his age, smelled like red tide when she came to visit, and I wasn't looking forward to the awkward conversation I would be having with my father. If I'm honest, though, part of me was intrigued by the photos Mom showed me. 

So, ignoring my therapist, who said, “Just give it a little more time,” I rode my bike to his beach house after school.

Dad’s place teetered on the sea, designed to blend with the ocean itself. 

On the edge of a cliff, with grandiose pillars (which were way too much), lay my father’s house, cut off from the rest of the town, and definitely showing off his wealth. 

I wasn't expecting it to be so modern. French doors leading me inside sported beta fish carvings, an axolotl in a fifty gallon tank greeting me with its trademark smile. I was hesitant at first. 

If I fully walked inside, I wouldn't be able to leave without having a painful conversation with my father.  

But running away seemed childish—even for a soon to be twelve year old.

I admit, I was impressed. 

If *these* were the lengths he'd gone to get my attention, well, he had me hook, line, and sinker. Dad had designed his house to resemble an aquarium. 

The hallway was illuminated with a soft blue light, every wall a different tank filled with a variety of fish. It was almost like being in real-life Animal Crossing. 

Farther down, glass floors mimicked the deep ocean, filled with tiny flounder swimming below.

I've always been afraid of heights, so stepping on flooring resembling the deep ocean, twisted my gut, and yet filled me with exhilaration. Like stepping across an underwater world. It was both beautiful, and *way* over the top. But that was Dad’s mo. 

We always had to have the *best* pool when I was a kid. 

“Sadie?” Dad’s voice startled me when I was staring, transfixed by everything around me. I didn't know what to look at first. Everything was *water* themed. 

Even the stairs. It was pretty, sure, but it didn't look *lived* in. The walls were filled with fish, a beautiful display of marine life showcased on every corner. I found myself pressed up against schools of nemo fish spiralling in scarlet streams, stealing away my breath. Beautiful. 

But there was nothing that made this house a home– stained coffee cups and magazines strewn all over the floor. 

That was Mom’s house. 

Dad’s was more like a museum. 

I was intrigued by the kitchen lit up in a bioluminescent glow, slowly inching towards it, when Dad’s voice came again.

This time, from underneath me. “I'm in the basement, sweetie!”

I had half a mind to run. It hit me that I didn't want to see my father, I just wanted to see my surprise. The teenage brain is selfish, but I had my reasons. 

Still, though, I found myself drawn to the basement, my sneakers making smacking noises down the steps. 

Unlike upstairs, the lower levels of Dad’s house were yet to be renovated. 

Thinking of the death star, there was no stair rail. My hands grazed cold brick walls, before darkness became ocean blue, like walking on the seafloor. 

The low hum of a filtration system cut through the silence, my steps quickening. 

The basement was not what I was expecting; a simple room with one singular tank. 

The stink of seawater and bleach drowned my nose and throat, both clinical and otherworldly, forcing my legs further. Dad stood in front, grinning beneath a banner saying, “Happy 12th birthday!”

I was already taking steps forward, my body in control of my mind. 

The tank was darker than the others, tiny green lights at the bottom illuminating clear water. 

I could barely register Dad’s words, my gaze glued to the glass. 

His voice sounded like ocean waves crashing against the shore, wading in and out of my ears. “I asked my friends for a favor,” he said. “They specialise in marine research, and…well, during their last expedition, they found something incredible, Sadie.” 

Dad’s grin was contagious, and in three strides, I was pressing my face against the glass. I don't know what I was expecting. Was it a new species of fish? 

“They're shy.” Dad hummed. “Just stay there, and they'll come over to you.”

I found my voice strangled in my throat, my skin prickling with goosebumps. *“They?”*

Something warm expanded in my chest when a face appeared behind the glass—a beautiful girl with long dark hair haloing around her, tiny points on her ears and strange rugged skin. But it wasn't her face I was mesmerised by. 

Yes, she was hypnotising, every part of her seemed to glow, wide green eyes and a glittering smile. I staggered back, a cry clawing at my throat, when I realized she didn't have legs. Instead, a long blue tail was moulded to her torso, each scale intricate and sparkling. 

The skin below her breast was rugged, slits carved into her flesh.

*Gills.*

This couldn't be happening, I thought, dizzily. 

I was staring at a real life mermaid. 

She was so pretty, graceful, gently tapping on the glass, playing an invisible piano with her fingers. 

I was joining in, laughing when the mermaid pressed her fingertips against mine, when movement came behind her, a shadow looming into view. 

It was a boy this time, dark brown hair billowing around him adorned with seaweed, a green tail in place of legs. There was a noticeable scar on his throat. 

It made me wonder if a fish had attacked him. The merman was different. Unlike his female companion, he *wasn’t* smiling, instead folding his arms and refusing to meet my gaze. When he accidentally made eye contact, he turned and flicked his tail in my face, hiding behind the girl. 

Dad laughed. “The male is quite standoffish. Don't worry, he's like that with everybody. He wasn't easy to catch.”

I could barely speak, staring at the girl, who waved, her smile broadening. 

“Uh-huh.” I managed to choke out. 

I didn't notice my father wrapping his arms around me. His touch felt foreign and wrong, but also comforting. 

I hadn't hugged him in so long. I found myself missing him, and the conversation I wanted to have, all of those poisonous words in my throat, contorted into childish squeals of joy. “They're yours, Sadie,” Dad murmured into my hair. 

“I have a deal where I can keep them here for observation, but they're officially *yours*.”

“Mermaids.” I said. 

Dad nodded. “Well, the scientific name for them is HAB, or human-like aquatic beings, but yes,” he chuckled, “They are mermaids.”

Dad paused, striding over to the tank. I noticed the male mermaid flinch, almost immediately swimming over to the glass, tapping his fingers against the pane. 

I joined him, raising my fingers while watching his dark brown curls fly around him, bubbles escaping his mouth when he parted his lips in what I *think* was a greeting. The points in his ears reminded me of fae, and I couldn't stop smiling. 

He looked so human, and yet these tiny details, like his ears, and narrow features, told me he *belonged* in the ocean.

I had dreamed of being able to breathe  underwater, and this boy was doing just that, staring at me with coffee brown eyes. When his head inclined slowly, I couldn't resist a giggle. 

I figured I looked pretty alien to him. 

Dad nudged me playfully. “We haven't figured out their language yet. We know it's quite similar to whales, or even dolphins. It's rare when they do speak, but it's beautiful, Sadie.” 

Dad’s eyes were wide. “It's almost like they're singing the melody of their world: the songs of their people.”

I prodded the glass, and the merman copied, his lips curling into a scowl. 

The female mermaid swam over, shoving him out of the way. 

She seemed more excited, following my fingers excitedly. 

“What do you think you're going to call them?” Dad hummed. 

I turned to him. “They don't have names?”

He shrugged, and then Dad’s expression was my father again, his eyes growing sad, like he remembered why I was here– and just like me, Dad didn't want to talk about my brother. Turning to face the mermaids, his smile faded. 

“They were originally named specimen one and two, but I don't think those names suit them.”

I met the girl’s eyes, and like a child, her smile broke out into a grin. 

While she was wide eyed and smiley, the male mermaid folded his arms, carefully tracking me with his gaze, lip curled, like he could sense me thinking up names. 

I traced the glass, the seaweed entangled in the boy’s hair almost resembling a crown. I half wondered, giddily, if the male was a Prince. 

“Falan.” I said, without thinking, and to my shock, he rolled his eyes. 

Dad cleared his throat. “The male seems to have remarkably similar characteristics to a human male,” he said, “His paperwork suggests he copies human expressions.”

I moved onto the girl, who was playful, tapping her fingers against the glass. 

“Aira.”

The girl nodded excitedly, copying my smile. 

Dad was hesitant this time to touch me, instead clapping me on the shoulder. “I think she likes her name,” he said, heading to the door. “Elle is making pasta, if you want to join us? No pressure, sweetie.”

Dad left me with the mermaids, and admittedly, the first thing I did was jump up and down like a, well, a twelve year old. 

I ate dinner with Dad and his girlfriend that  night, and I waited to have “the talk” but it never came. In fact, when I visited the following weekend, everything I wanted to tell him was suffocated by the beings in his basement. 

I spent hours with the two of them, talking to Aira about everything from school to my worries about my mother
She would nod and try to listen, her eyes wide, like she could understand me. 

I figured that wasn't the case when I lied and told her an asteroid was going to destroy the planet, and she nodded excitedly, lips spreading into a grin. 

Sometimes, she copied me. When I laughed, she did too– or she tried to. 

I don't think it was easy for her under the water. I started missing therapy sessions to spend time with the mermaids, but it was only Aira who engaged with me, always waiting for me when I arrived, sometimes asleep, curled up at the bottom of the tank. 

Falan, meanwhile, completely ignored me, instead spending all of his time either scowling at me, or closer to the surface. 

I caught him trying to swim up several times, only to dive back down, returning to his little spot to continue brooding. 

As I got older, I expected the mermaids to age, too. 

But instead, they seemed to be physically frozen around what looked like the ages of early twenties, judging from their looks. I turned thirteen, and I spent every summer and weekend with them. 

Dad told me to entertain them, try and get them used to human activities, so I introduced them to my phone, pressing it to the glass. 

While Aira seemed impressed (by literally everything), Falan did his signature eye roll, as if saying, *“Oh, wow, it's a weird device with a light! I've already seen one.”*

Dad did say the male mermaid was talented at mimicking human expression, so I figured Falan *had* seen a phone. 

So, in my quest to impress this stubborn merboy, I showed him a TV, and then my Nintendo 3DS. He didn't seem interested in the TV, but his eyes lit up when I showed him Pokémon. 

I think it was the bright colors, but his eyes seemed glued to the screen, following my little character. 

I made an unspoken pact with him. 

I showed him Pokémon, playing it with him every time I visited, and he stopped with the scowling and the rolling of the eyes. 

Falan didn't stop being an asshole, but every time I stepped into the basement, it was *him* who was waiting, eagerly, his face pressed against the glass. 

When he saw me, the merman leaned back, pretending he wasn't waiting for me. I showed him a new game, Zelda, and he surprised me with the smallest of smiles, his eyes glued to my screen. 

Aira sometimes joined us, but she grew bored easily, either falling asleep, or swimming up to the surface. 

After introducing him to video games, Falan was a lot more animated. 

I was fourteen when I dragged myself, once again, to Dad’s beach house. It was my first year of junior high, and I had nobody to talk to about the mermaids. 

When I visited them, Falan was on the surface, leaning against the side, his head comfortably nestled in his arms. 

I noticed the tank was open, so it must have been feeding time. 

Every day around 5pm, Dad opened up the tank, dropping in what looked like mutilated fish guts, and little flakes. 

Falan always ignored the food, while Aira immediately dove for fleshy entrails, stuffing them into her mouth. 

Falan needed a little coaxing, so Dad thrust a long metal pole into the water, gently nudging the merman towards the food. 

That day, there was no sign of my father, and both mermaids were on the surface. 

Falan, with his head in his arms, and Aira, looking lost, her eyes wide. 

It was the first time I had seen her without her excited little grin.

Falan must have sensed me, since his head jerked up when I dropped my backpack on the floor. 

This was the first time I'd seen him fully on the surface, but when he locked eyes with me, I realized he was panting, struggling to breathe, his fingers gingerly prodding at his throat. The air must have been hurting him, I thought.

He wasn't used to our air, so *why* was he so insistent on staying on the surface? 

*Stupid boy.* 

I made my way over to the tank, and to my surprise, he swam over, sticking his head over the side. 

Falan made a choking sound and I understood he was trying (and failing) to mimic our language. He tried again, his eyes strained, lips parting, but no words came out, only strange guttural noises I could almost mistake for words. 

This happened twice. 

The second time, the tank was half shut, but Falan broke the surface when he saw me come in, parted his lips, and tried to speak, seemingly frustrated with his inability to mimic human speech. He tried again, and this time l could see he was visibly struggling to stay on the surface. 

Aira, to my confusion, pulled him back under the water, and to me, pointed upwards. I did my best to communicate with her, just like dad told me. I had to speak with my hands instead of my mouth. 

“You want me to open the tank?” I said, motioning upwards. 

“Sadie.” 

Dad joined me, carrying a bucket full of entrails. 

He dumped the food in the tank and shut the lid all the way, flashing me a smile. 

“I know they're pretty to look at, but they're also dangerous.” he nodded to Falan, who ignored the food, instead pressed against the glass, glaring at my father. “These beings are carnivores, sweetie. I don't mean to scare you, but I don't think swimming with them would be a whole lot of fun.” 

I found myself nodding, watching sharp red dilute the depths, Aira snatching up tangled fish intestine. 

I watched her eat it, sharp incisors biting through a cloud of red obscuring my vision and spreading around her. 

The smile on her face no longer looked playful. She looked happy to be eating, and something ice cold trickled down my spine when her eyes met mine, this time not with curiosity, but something else entirely, something I was in denial of. 

After that day, I guess I started to grow up. The mermaids in my Dad’s basement were beautiful, yes, but all signs pointed to them also trying to lure me into their tank. Dad didn't say *they will eat you*, but he did supervise my visits from then on, making sure I kept my distance. 

The two of them didn't change, but my childhood fantasy of friendly fish people darkened to a more plausible reality. 

Falan and Aira were not my friends, nor were they my presents. 

I was the naive prey who was almost fish food. 

I stopped visiting after Falan started gesturing me inside their tank. 

I wanted nothing to do with them. 

Growing up, I still saw them during holidays. 

But the basement was filling up with other things, my dad's belongings and my toys from childhood. 

I saw them once before college, the two of them slamming themselves against the tank when I walked in. 

I couldn't tell if they were excited or hungry. Aira’s eyes were almost sad, her lips parting as if to say, *You left us*.

Falan tapped the glass, cocking his head. I noticed his scar was bigger. 

Maybe Dad accidentally caught it when he was coaxing the merman to his food. 

I think Falan knew it was a goodbye. 

He didn't understand the concept of college, and I wasn't going to try to explain it to him. 

I left them like that, and never went back. 

Over these years, I wondered if Dad had released them back into the sea. 

Ever since I left home at eighteen, I've been flying to and from college every couple of months, due to a respiratory condition that came out of nowhere. 

I thought it was the mold in my college dorms, but when I moved to another room, I still found myself waking up, choking on air, like my lungs refuse to work. 

Numerous scans informed me I'm completely healthy, and all the doctor can give me is an inhaler. I was supposed to meet with a specialist in town anyway, so I figured I would pay dad a visit.

I headed back to Dad’s beach house with the excuse to pick up some old  trinkets I left behind. 

There was no sign of him, so I let myself in, making my way down to the basement. 

Dad had changed the lighting to a duller blue, and immediately, I was comforted with the familiar stink of saltwater and strong bleach that smelled right. 

The stairs were *wet*, I noticed, slowly making my way down to the basement.

The tank was still there, illuminated in dazzling blue. 

But it was bigger. 

I saw Aira before she saw me, and I noticed a change in her. 

She wasn't smiling. 

Instead, the mermaid’s eyes were alert, her fingers tapping against the glass. 

“Hey.” I greeted her, a cough I couldn't control taking over. 

Aira jumped, startled, when I knocked on the glass. Her gaze found mine, and something twisted in my gut. 

Her expression was wild, contorted, and not what I remembered. 

When she pointed upwards for me to open the tank, I shook my head, biting back the urge to say, “Nice try.”

I could tell she hadn't eaten yet. The tank was fresh, so my dad was yet to feed them. 

“Where's Falan?” I asked, remembering how to talk with my expression. 

Aira didn't respond. With a stoic face, she pointed upwards again. 

The absurdity of me talking to my childhood mermaid friend sent me into fits of laughter– which became a coughing fit. 

When I spluttered out a cough, her eyes widened, and I swore her gaze flicked to my torso. With the mermaid mostly ignoring me, I went in search of my trinkets I left behind in one of the towering boxes filling the basement. 

I was looking for my music box, and an old mermaid figurine Harvey had given me for my fifth birthday. 

I found myself going through memory lane diving into boxes of old toys, and my endless collection of mermaid memorabilia. Shoving aside holiday decorations, I stuck my hands in another box, pulling out a folded yellow dress. 

The dress was cute, but I didn't remember wearing it. 

I thought maybe it was Elle’s, but it was way too small. Elle was a curvy woman. 

Throwing the dress aside, I pulled out cargo shorts this time. Followed by a short sleeved band shirt, and a lakers cap covered in dust. With the clothes in my hands, I had a sudden hysterical thought that these were my brother’s clothes. 

But he was dead. 

He died when I was nine years old. 

I could feel my hands starting to tremble, digging deeper into the box. 

This time, a backpack with a tiny Pikachu attached to the zipper. I went through it, pulling out workbooks and crumbled schedules, a bottle of water and a crumbling sandwich covered in mold. 

Opening the workbooks, I flicked through pages and pages of intricate handwriting. 

A stress toy was at the very bottom of the pack, collecting dust. 

I could sense my breathing starting to accelerate when my hands grasped a bright green handbag filled with make-up, a dead phone, and a laptop. 

But it was right at the bottom of the box, where I found the nail in the coffin that sent bile shooting up my throat. 

Two college ID’s. The first, neat and looked after, on a red string, belonged to a scowling twenty two year old English major, Matthew Whittam. 

The second ID tag, covered in scribbles and doodles, was twenty three year old Quinn Cartwright, a smiling brunette, who, according to her tag, was a film student. 

The tag slipped out of my hands, and I puked, heaving up my mediocre dinner.

Aira and Falan. 

The beings in the tank were not mermaids. They were HUMAN. 

Before I could stop myself, I grabbed the clothes again, the yellow dead with noticeable smears of red on the collar, and the cargo shorts torn and bloodied when I turned them inside out. 

I don't even remember standing up. 

With the ID tag in my hands, I stumbled over to the tank, pressing Aira’s identity against the glass. 

But she didn't even recognize herself, slowly cocking her head to the side. 

This hurt, a pang in my chest physically squeezing my lungs. 

This time, I opened the tank, and the girl broke the surface. 

She didn't speak, because she *couldn't*, instead flailing her arms. 

I thought back to the scar on Falan's throat, and I felt sick to my stomach. 

Instead of speaking, Aira pointed to the door, her eyes wide and desperate. 

“It's okay,” I told her calmly. “Where's Falan?”

When her eyes narrowed to slits, I caught myself. 

“Matthew.” I corrected, quickly. “Where is Matthew?”

Before she could respond, my father’s voice sounded from upstairs. 

Followed by what sounded like muffled screaming. 

Aira’s head snapped to me when the muffled screaming grew closer, my father’s footsteps following. 

I could hear the sound of something wet hitting concrete, like a tail. 

Aira pointed towards a box, and I understood, diving behind the door. 

The wet slapping noises continued, all the way down the stairs, before my father appeared, a bloody apron over jeans and a shirt, dragging along a figure. 

It was another guy, lying on his stomach, blood spilling from his lips and nose, streaking down his bare torso. 

I had to slap my hand over my mouth. I could still see the guy’s legs, or what used to be his legs, twisted into something resembling a tail. 

His ears still looked human, the sharp points almost looked man-made. 

Dad dragged the boy across the floor, panting. “It's okay,” he told the boy who was half human. The guy was struggling to breathe, like a fish out of water. “Once your lungs have gotten used to the water, you'll adapt.”

When he yanked the boy by his grotesque legs slowly morphing into a tail, the boy coughed up something that dripped down his chin. His eyes were wide and unseeing, his arms dead weights by his side. Dad carried the boy, bridal style, up a ladder to the surface. 

I thought he was going to throw him in, but instead, my father pulled out a knife. “It's okay,” he kept telling the guy in sharp breaths, “I know it hurts, but you won't be able to adapt if I don't do this.” 

I could see Aira watching, her hand over her mouth, as my father dragged the blade across the boy’s throat, slicing it open, and dumping him into the water. 

The boy sank, his body bent in an arch, sharp red blooming around him. 

He was dead. 

His tail was limp, his arms dragging him down. 

Aira caught the boy, cradling him in her arms. 

Dad watched, a smile pricking on his lips. 

The ‘merman’ jolted in Aira’s arms, his eyes shooting open, and when he breathed, he breathed by habit, clutching his chest, a stream of bubbles flying from his mouth. 

When the nameless boy caught hold of himself, he pounded his fists against the glass, lips parting in a silent cry. Dad ignored him, dumping fish guts into the water, and forcing him to eat them. 

It struck me why Falan and Aira were only alert when they didn't eat. 

My father was drugging their food, keeping them docile. 

He had cut their voices directly from their throat. 

Carved into their bodies, cruelly moulding them into my stupid fucking childhood fantasy. 

When my Dad left them, Aira tried to tell me to stay to help her calm down the new merman, who kept pounding his fists against the glass. 

But I think part of her wanted me to hunt down her companion. I knew from the panicked glances she kept sending me that she was worried for him. 

Dad said his office was out of bounds when I was a kid, and I never thought much of it. 

When I pushed through the door, which was surprisingly unlocked, I realized *why*. 

All around me, bathed in clinical white light, were towering tanks filled with both human and fish parts; floating torsos and severed heads, victims no longer with identities.

Dad was studying how to combine the two. His notes were strewn everywhere, screwed up and thrown in an overflowing trash can, and stuck to the wall. I found Falan pinned to a surgical table, a tube stuck down his throat. 

The human boy cruelly twisted into something *inhuman*, and yet my father was sadistic enough to continue the facade, leaving the seaweed entwined in his curls, like he was a circus act. 

There was a sensor above him, every movement he made setting off a sprinkler, soaking him. 

It was when he *didn't* move, which glued me to the spot. 

When his tail dried up, I panicked, reaching to wave my arm in front of the sensor. 

Instead, however, to my shock, his tail started to change, contorting and morphing into *something* that resembled legs, but were more grotesque, cruelly stitched to his torso in a horrific attempt to change from a mermaid into a human boy.

When the sensor activated, soaking him again, Falan’s body jerked, and he choked up splattered red splashing the tube.

His eyes flickered open, and he opened his mouth to speak.

But his words were gibberish, his voice a incomprensible hiss. 

I remembered how to move. 

Police. 

That was my first thought. 

I needed to get the cops. 

I tried to leave, stumbling over to the door, but something caught my eye. 

Another tank, and floating inside it, an all too familiar face. 

But he wasn't supposed to be so limp, so *wrong.*

Unmoving. 

Harvey's body had long since decomposed, and yet pieces of flesh still remained, still my big brother, and yet his body wasn't, cruelly ripped apart and stitched together, a mutilated fish tail attached to his torso. 

His skin was covered in mismatched scales, like a virus taking over, shredding him apart, only leaving a slimy, green tinged substance coating him. 

Harvey was dead. 

But the thing stitched to him, entangling decomposing flesh, was still *alive*. 

I got out of there, and then the house in four single breaths. 

I ran home.

I woke up yesterday unable to breathe, this time choking up blood. 

Mom wasn't there.

When I stepped into the shower, I pieced together my thoughts and what exactly I was going to tell the cops, without sounding crazy. 

But when my fingers grazed the skin of my torso, just below my breast, I could feel three singular gashes in my skin. 

Feeling the other side, there they were, splitting my flesh apart, warm to the touch, and yet somehow feeling natural. 

I can't believe I'm saying this, but being in water feels better. I can finally breathe. 

But I find myself stumbling when I'm trying to walk, and I'm terrified. 

I keep getting out of breath, and my skin feels too dry. Like it's sucked of moisture. 

I tried to get into the basement earlier, and unsurprisingly, it's locked. 

There's no sign of Mom or Dad. 

The only thing I have right now is Mom’s stupid pet fish. 

I feel like I'm suffocating on air. 

You have to help me. 

Please help me save the people trapped in my father’s basement!",948,0.98,36,Trash_Tia,2024-11-08 15:54:42,1gmu7p9,984,High
NoSleep,The Thorns That Refuse to Die,"I log into the video call, like I do every week, joining faces that appear one by one on the screen, each set of eyes weighed down by shadows I know all too well. We’re all here for similar reasons—each of us dealing with something knotted inside, wounds that go back further than any of us want to remember. The therapist tries to get us talking, to break the ice and help us make sense of it all. So, every week, we share a “Rose” and a “Thorn”: one small moment of light, and one thing that’s still holding us down.

Most weeks, I keep it simple. My rose is always something like “I got out of bed every day.” And my thorn? Well, I usually just say, “I’m still here,” and leave it at that. They don’t push for more, and I can see it in their eyes—these people know what it’s like to wrestle with things you don’t want to talk about.

One Thursday, after our call, I decide to tackle my garden. My therapist suggested that working with my hands could be good for me, maybe help me feel more in control. So, I find myself out there, staring down the wild rose bushes that have been growing untouched in the yard, twisting over themselves with dark, thorny branches. The garden almost feels like a mirror—overgrown, tangled, clawing.

I grab the shears and start hacking away. As I reach for a particularly twisted branch, a thorn lunges out, slicing into my wrist, deep and fast. It takes me a second to even register the pain, but when I do, it’s like a jolt of ice running up my arm. Blood starts to seep down, thick and dark, and I stumble back, heart pounding. The thorn glints in the fading light, cruel and sharp, as if it’s mocking me.

The next morning, I’m drawn back to the garden with this strange, sinking feeling. And there it is—the thorn I’d cut yesterday, standing tall again, curling toward me like it had never been touched. My wrist starts throbbing beneath the bandage, the pain twisting in rhythm with my pulse. I grab the shears, hands shaking, and clip the thorn again, watching it drop to the ground. But as I turn to leave, a chill settles over me, deep and bone-cold.

That night, I sink into an uneasy sleep, and then the dream begins.

I’m back in my garden, only it’s grown into this dark, endless forest, with thick, twisting shadows stretching out toward me. The thorny vines wrap around my legs, coiling up my arms, each thorn digging deeper into my skin. I try to move, but I can’t. I’m rooted in place as they tighten, winding around my bones, piercing through flesh, leaving searing, jagged trails. I try to scream, but nothing comes out—only this low, chilling whisper.

Just before I’m pulled into the earth, I hear it clearly: “Sometimes the thorns we cut away are the ones that refuse to ever leave.”

I jolt awake, gasping, my heart hammering in my chest. I look down, and there it is—my wrist, bleeding again, the cut fresh and raw, as if I’d never bandaged it. In the mirror, my face is pale, and my eyes look darker, sunken. The whisper from my dream echoes in my mind, sinking in, like those thorns had taken root beneath my skin.

When the next video call comes around, I can barely speak. My voice trembles as I force out my rose: “I made it through the week.” But when it’s time to share my thorn, my throat tightens. My fingers brush over the fresh bandage on my wrist.

“There’s… something in my garden,” I say, barely above a whisper. “A thorn that won’t stay gone. Every time I cut it back, it comes back sharper. It cuts me deeper.” Silence settles over the call, and I can feel the tension in their faces. Some look away, eyes flickering with worry, but my therapist just watches me, her face shadowed.

“Sometimes,” she says softly, “it’s the thorns we cut back that grow the deepest.”

That night, I dream again, and this time it’s darker, sharper. I’m back in that endless, twisted forest, with thorns reaching up toward a blood-red sky. I look down, horrified, as thorny vines start to push up through my skin, curling around my arms, piercing me from the inside out. The whisper comes again, louder this time, filling my mind, consuming me.

“Sometimes the thorns we cut away are the ones that refuse to ever leave.”

I wake up to find my wrist bleeding again, the wound cutting through scars that barely had time to heal. Outside, the garden looms dark and wild, each thorn glinting in the morning light, reaching as if it knows. I realize, in that moment, I’ll never try to cut them again.

As I close my laptop after the next call, the whisper comes one last time, creeping through the silence like a voice I know too well:

“Some thorns are yours forever.”",35,0.88,3,ezekiel_h_graves,2024-11-09 06:05:52,1gn8nz4,38,High
NoSleep,"I Went Searching for My Missing Sister, but Something Found Me Instead [Part 1]","\[1\] - [\[2\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gnvgsm/i_went_searching_for_my_missing_sister_but/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \- [\[3\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gpd8il/i_went_searching_for_my_missing_sister_but/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

It’s been one year since my sister Evelyn vanished. One year of dead ends, empty searches, and a silence that eats at me. People say you’re supposed to move on, but that’s impossible when there’s no closure, no answers—when it feels like she’s still out there somewhere, waiting for me to find her.

 

She disappeared near a hidden lake deep in the woods outside our town, Laketon. The place is called Mirror Pool. Even the name makes people tense up; locals have whispered about that lake for as long as I can remember. No one ever really explains *why*, just mutters things like, *“Never go there alone,”* or *“Don’t look too long into the water.*” You’d think it was a myth to scare kids, but Evelyn… she became obsessed with it. She was never one to ignore something so curious and forbidden.

 

I remember her standing in front of that lake, watching the water as though it had answers she needed, something she couldn’t put into words. And then, just like that, she was gone.

 

The police searched every inch of Mirror Pool and the surrounding forest. They dragged the lake, combed through the woods… but it was like she’d been erased. Not a single trace. No footprints, no clothing, not even a broken branch to suggest where she might have gone. Just… gone.

 

The only thing left behind was her journal. I found it under her mattress a week after she vanished, buried beneath her usual mess of books and drawings. I wasn’t sure I wanted to read it. Evelyn was private, and something about prying into her thoughts felt wrong. But desperation does strange things to you. So, one night, I opened it, hoping maybe she’d left some kind of clue.

 

Most of the journal was typical Evelyn—sketches, story ideas, observations about people she’d seen around town. But then I reached the last few pages, and things took a darker turn. Her writing became frantic, almost erratic, like she was on the edge of something, teetering between fascination and fear. She wrote about Mirror Pool with an intensity that left me chilled.

 

There was one line in particular that I can’t shake, no matter how hard I try:

 

*“The water… I saw something in it, something that looked just like me but wasn’t. It was smiling, and I know I wasn’t smiling.”*

 

I’ve read that sentence a hundred times, feeling a chill creep down my spine every time. It’s as if Evelyn saw something in that lake that she couldn’t unsee, something that took hold of her in a way that scared even her. And yet… she kept going back.

 

Days turned into weeks, then months. People stopped talking about Evelyn, and life in Laketon went on as if she’d never existed. But for me, her absence is like a hole in my chest, an ache that never goes away. And that one sentence from her journal—it lingers, clawing at the edges of my mind, making me feel like there’s something more out there, something I have to understand.

 

I told myself I’d stay away, that I’d let the past stay buried. But on the anniversary of her disappearance, something snapped. I needed to know. I couldn’t keep living with these questions, these half-imagined horrors. I had to see Mirror Pool for myself. I had to know what had drawn her in, what she saw in those waters.

 

The hike to Mirror Pool is longer than I remember. The path twists and winds through dense forest, the trees thickening as if they’re trying to keep me out. The sun is setting, casting long shadows that stretch like fingers across the ground, and the air grows colder with each step, an unnatural chill that settles deep in my bones. I tell myself it’s just nerves, just fear messing with my head, but part of me can’t shake the feeling that something in these woods is watching me.

 

When I finally reach the clearing, I stop short. Mirror Pool lies ahead, nestled between dark trees, its surface unnaturally still. It doesn’t look like water at all, more like a sheet of black glass reflecting the bruised sky above. There’s something… wrong about it, a presence in the air that makes my skin prickle. I can’t explain it, but it’s as if the lake is alive, aware, watching me just as intently as I’m watching it.

 

I take a step closer, then another, feeling the weight of the silence pressing down on me. The only sound is my own breathing, quick and shallow, as I approach the water’s edge. I stare into the lake, and my reflection stares back—pale, tired, hollow-eyed. But there’s something else, something I can’t quite place.

 

Then, slowly, my reflection changes. The corners of its mouth twitch, curling up into a smile. It’s a small, subtle thing, but I feel my stomach drop. Because I know I’m not smiling. My face is blank, expressionless, but *she* is grinning back at me with a look that’s both familiar and wrong, as though there’s something lurking behind those eyes that isn’t me.

 

I stagger back, my heart hammering in my chest, and the reflection vanishes. The water is still again, a perfect, unbroken mirror. I tell myself it was just a trick of the light, my mind playing games, but there’s a tightness in my chest, a feeling that I’m being pulled into something dark and terrible.

 

As I turn to leave, I hear it—a faint whisper, so soft I almost miss it. But it’s unmistakable, a voice that sounds like mine, but twisted and hollow.

 

“Come back,” it murmurs. “Stay with me.”

 

The words send ice through my veins. I glance back at the lake, but the water is silent, unmoving. I try to shake it off, tell myself it’s just my imagination, but as I make my way back through the woods, the whisper lingers, following me like a shadow, repeating over and over in my mind.

 

“Come back. Stay with me.”

 

I make it home, barely able to catch my breath, and collapse into bed, telling myself that it was just a dream, a trick of the mind. But as I lie there in the darkness, I can’t shake the feeling that something is waiting for me. That something saw me in that lake, something that’s calling to me with my own voice, waiting patiently for the moment I look back.

 

And I know, deep down, that this is only the beginning.",72,0.94,5,Important-Victory-25,2024-11-09 01:27:20,1gn4tkf,77,High
NoSleep,"We discovered a rainforest on an unexplored mountain, and something discovered us.","The second-worst mistake was arriving.

The worst mistake was leaving.

There’s a certain arrogance to human exploration. Driving the flag into the dirt first, as if that means a damn thing. Of course, I'm not entirely cynical. Charting the world is about more than greed and glory — it’s about overcoming that ancient fear of the unknown. Mapping every plot of land so there are no more hidden crevices to keep us up at night. Nonetheless, our endeavours *are* selfish. And we have, for many centuries, blindly considered ourselves superior. When discovering new land, we’ve never considered a haunting possibility.

That something *other* than man may have already staked a claim.

“Temper your expectations,” Dr Crenshaw, our expedition leader, warned loudly as we scaled the cliff-face of a thousand-metre-tall mountain.

I grunted whilst finding handholds and footholds in unreliable nooks. We were ascending no ordinary mountain. The rock-formed skyscraper jutted from the dirt like a square, or perhaps a squircle, poking out of a sorting cube’s hole. It was a flat-topped mound rising almost *unnaturally* out of the ground-level forest. A misshapen mountain sprouting bushy trees, like hairs from its level head. That old-growth rainforest, we hoped, would be untouched. We wanted to discover it before anyone else.

It was an inselberg — meaning “island mountain”. Such natural formations, which tower above flat land, are difficult to climb, on account of their near-vertical sides. That was why we doubted any early humans would have managed to reach the top of the berg. We were ecstatic to be the first explorers to tread on that sky-high soil. An undiscovered piece of land is a rarity in the twenty-first century.

It took nearly two hours to reach the mountaintop. Crenshaw was the first to disappear over the sharp edge. He crawled onto the grass, unclipped his carabiner, and gasped loudly — prompting Howard Williams, Rachel Garcia, and me to speed up a little, as we were eager to experience that momentous event for ourselves.

I was the second to cross the threshold and see the rainforest in reality, rather than a photograph. I pushed up from the grass with my palms, and my jaw fell as I stood. As I witnessed the splendour of the wooded ocean ahead. A canopy of leaves nearly entirely blocking out all sunlight, creating a sense of calm in the forest. A sense of peace that we were about to disturb.

This was a team of biologists and researchers who had spent years following in the footsteps of others. We did not stop to think. We were all enchanted by the possibility of doing something original. The possibility of making history.

“What do you think, Steph?” Howard asked, collecting our climbing equipment.

“It’s pretty,” I said, brushing mud and debris off my clothes.

He rolled his eyes. “I was hoping for something a little more, y’know, scientific.”

“And I was hoping for more than thirty seconds to conduct my research, Howard,” I teased.

He chuckled and replied, “That’s fair.”

“I’m eager to see this cave,” Rachel said.

Dr Crenshaw pointed ahead. “Well, if we push ahead, we’ll be in and out long before nightfall.”

“You seem confident,” Howard said. “Do you need a moment to get your bearings?”

“Not at all, Williams. I’ve been studying the aerial mappings religiously for the past month,” Dr Crenshaw said. “To the detriment of my health, I must admit.”

“Yes, it was a little disconcerting to have a *yawning* man climbing directly above me,” I pointed out. “But, after watching you work for so many weeks, I don’t doubt that you would be able to sleepwalk your way to this cave entrance.”

Our leader laughed, letting a glimpse of emotion loose. “I won’t argue with that, Smithson. Come on. Let’s get moving.”

Crenshaw was such a tightly-wound man. I was relieved to see him letting his muscles loosen. Letting himself enjoy something. He rarely looked joyous. His hunger to climb this inselberg in Mozambique was driven by *necessity*, not desire. It was an itch he simply had to scratch, no matter how apprehensive he felt.

He wasn’t a cold man. In fact, I’d always viewed him a little as a father figure. Stoic and silent, but layered. I wanted to help our leader. Wanted to ease some of his anxiety about the excursion. That was why I rushed through the tall, mopane trees of the forest, which formed a sun-obstructing canopy overhead. Rushed to catch up to Crenshaw. The man was twice my age, but barely broke a sweat. His pace was hard to match, so I settled for tagging along just behind him.

“This is a historical moment,” I breathlessly said.

Crenshaw grunted. “If…”

“If?” I repeated between heavy pants.

“If we haven’t been *beaten*,” he finished.

I shook my head. “We haven’t been beaten. I’m sure of it. We were the first to locate this forest with the aerial—”

“I’m not talking about recorded history,” Dr Crenshaw interrupted. “At some point, long ago, man may well have walked here.”

“How?” I asked. “The sides are so steep. So difficult to climb even with modern gear.”

“Sometimes,” the man began, slowing his stride, “things are difficult to see, Smithson.”

And then he stopped, causing me to almost bump into his back.

“Careful, Steph!” Rachel said, almost colliding with me. “What’s the hold-up, slow-poke?”

“We found it,” Dr Crenshaw whispered.

The leader stepped aside, allowing the rest of the team to see what he had found.

There was a hole in the dirt — the entrance to the cave. To a pocket within the mountain.

“I’ll unload the gear,” Howard said, starting to unzip his rucksack.

“No need,” Crenshaw replied, pointing his torch into the chasm. “Look.”

The four of us crept towards the edge of the cave entrance below our feet, and we followed the bright beam. It illuminated a walkway protruding from cave’s inner surface. A slope of rock hugging the wall and spiralling downwards.

Not a single member of the team spoke for the next thirty seconds. Our gazes traced every surface revealed by the beam. I did not know for certain, but I presumed the sloping walkway continued right to the bottom, as the torch did not illuminate the cave’s floor one hundred feet below.

Eventually, we all accepted the hole’s inescapable purpose.

“A stairwell,” Rachel whispered.

Crenshaw nodded. “Yes, Garcia. A stairwell.”

“So, we’re not the first,” Howard sighed. “All of that effort—”

“To find a long-lost remnant of our ancestors,” Dr Crenshaw finished, taking a tentative step onto the stone slide.

“That doesn’t seem like a good idea,” I said. “We have no idea how old it might be.”

“It’s more than a primitive staircase,” the leader announced, bouncing his boot soles on the sturdy slope. “It feels sturdy. Just imagine the advanced craftsmanship necessary to construct something like this, Smithson. Those ancient hands could’ve merely carved a tunnel into the cave’s wall, but the *attached* stones. Joined them together to form an intricate ramp. Imagine what marvels might lie below.”

Howard and Rachel followed their leader into the entrance, but I frowned and firmly stood my ground. “It doesn’t feel right. What kind of prehistoric civilisation would’ve been able to achieve this?”

None of my team members answered. And I realised, as they kept walking, that I would either have to follow or be left alone. Left in a forest which did not fill me with as much wonder as I had expected.

I chose to follow.

I hurried to catch up to my colleagues, hardly noticing that they had stopped walking. Had stopped to stare in awe at the wall.

“Careful!” I laughed, echoing Rachel’s earlier caution as I nearly bumped into her. “There’s no handrail up here.”

She pointed at the wall. “Look at this, Steph.”

I followed the light of Crenshaw’s torch to several lines of markings on the cave wall. The four of us moved closer to the symbols, with incremental waddles, as there was little room on the three-feet-wide slope. But moving nearer did nothing to answer burning questions. The marks, falling somewhere between drawings and hieroglyphs, became less discernible the closer I looked. It was as if the shapes were shifting. Endlessly restructuring.

I told myself, of course, that—

*It’s just a trick of the light.*

I felt silly, as I’d explored countless cave systems across the planet, and I’d never been afraid of the dark before. Never been afraid of the unexplained. But there was a secret in that place I knew we weren’t meant to learn. Something in my mind, or perhaps my very body, rejected the cave. Reacted violently, screeching at me to drag the four of us out of there.

Some small part of me, however, wouldn’t cooperate.

“You’re the expert,” Howard said to Crenshaw. “What is this?”

“It’s beautiful,” the leader answered in a faint whisper.

There was a detached expression on his face. An absent, unwilling nature to the way in which he raised a shaky hand towards the wall. Crenshaw was always detached, of course, but never like this. He was always lost in thought, but there no longer seemed to be anything behind the man’s teary eyes.

*Get a hold of yourself*, I berated myself. *This is once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for your career. Do not fumble it.*

“We should record this,” Rachel timidly suggested as our leader brushed his fingertips against the etchings. “Dr Crenshaw, I don’t think we should do that. We wouldn’t want to damage it.”

“Damage it?” Howard asked, before laughing. “It’s a stone etching that’s lasted for millennia. It’ll survive the human touch.”

He didn’t feel it, but Rachel did. I did.

“Dr Crenshaw…” I started.

Then came a sharp cry of pain from our fearless leader’s mouth, and the rest of us jolted in shock. We steadied ourselves quickly, thankfully, managing not to plummet over the side of the slope. And Crenshaw’s hand retracted — whipped backwards with what sounded like the crack of bones, except the awful noise came from the wall itself.

“Crenshaw!” Howard cried. “Are you okay?”

“… Yes,” the man murmured.

He lifted his index finger into the light of his torch, revealing a thin trickle of red spilling down the back of his hand.

“How did you do that?” Howard asked. “Did you cut it on something?”

I started to take off my rucksack. “I’ve got the first-aid kit.”

Dr Crenshaw shook his head and shone the torch beam onto the wall again. “That won’t be necessary.”

Only I seemed to see it, as the man quickly drew his torch away, but my photographic memory always serves me well. There had, undoubtedly, been a difference in the drawing. One of the shapes had vanished. The squiggles, or glyphs, meant nothing to me, but I could see each of them clearly in my mind. There had been, amongst the rows of etchings, a trapezium bearing two small dots within.

It was missing from the end of the final line. From the spot on the wall that I was certain Crenshaw had touched with his outstretched forefinger. But I have no idea why I didn’t tell the others that. No idea why I let them continue to follow the slope down into the cave. No idea, most importantly, why I followed.

Things were off-centre in that place. *We* were off-centre.

My eyes scanned the walls erratically as we descended deeper and deeper. The lack of any further etchings only made me fear that they had *been* there, but vanished. Then my skin started to itch, and it was only adrenaline that stopped me from scratching.

Half an hour later, we reached it. The end of the stairwell. The floor of the cave. And once he’d stepped off the stone slope, Dr Crenshaw turned to cast his light onto the team. Everybody was uncharacteristically quiet, and I didn’t like it. I didn’t like that, as we followed the sloping staircase, I’d noticed Howard and Rachel scratching at their skin too. Red, nail-carved streaks marked their napes.

“I need to stop,” Rachel mumbled, swaying on her feet.

In response to her request, strangely, Dr Crenshaw faced away from us. He swung his torch to face the large, black tunnel ahead. The true cave.

“By my estimations, this tunnel can only be, at most, thirty acres long,” the leader grumbled. “At a brisk pace, we could reach the end in half an hour. We must soldier onwards, Garcia.”

I crossed the cave’s floor over to Rachel, her shuddering form barely visible with Crenshaw’s torch facing the other way. The man was just standing still. Staring into the dark mouth of the cave. Its *real* mouth. Not the stairwell we’d followed.

By the time I reached my colleague, she had turned pale. Even in the scarce light, that much was clear. Her rows of teeth were knocking against one another, and when I placed the back of my hand against her brow, her skin iced mine. Left me with the hot sting of touching something below freezing. Of course, that seemed impossible, given the cave’s stifling temperature. I was sweating. I didn’t understand how Rachel could be cold.

“Dr Crenshaw,” I barked as our leader eyeballed the black abyss ahead. “We need to get Rachel out of here *now*. She requires medical attention.”

“Aren’t you a woman of medicine?” Crenshaw muttered quietly.

I clenched my fists. “I’m a biologist, Dr Crenshaw. You know that. But I don’t know what’s happening to her.”

Rachel was starting to squat and shrink into herself, so I guided her down to the ground.

“Cold…” she whimpered as I started to take off my rucksack.

Inside, I found my spare coat and a jumper, then I knelt down and proceeded to wrap my colleague in both. Howard, meanwhile, strolled towards Crenshaw with a huff and snatched the torch of his hand. The leader did not protest. He continued to stare directly ahead whilst Howard walked over to us. Then the man handed the torch to me.

“Could’ve done with an extra light whilst we were walking down the Death Slope,” I said.

“I wanted both of my hands free,” Howard said, before offering a weak smile. “Not my fault you always forget the most basic things.”

I sighed, then said, “Sorry. I didn’t mean to snap. This is just—”

“I know,” Howard interrupted, kneeling beside me to inspect our frozen colleague. “What’s happening, Rachel? Talk to us.”

“My stomach…” she whispered, clutching her abdomen with unsteady fingers. “It’s burning.”

“Burning?” I asked, frowning. “You’re cold to the touch.”

“I feel…” Rachel began, trailing off.

Howard reached towards her stomach, then stopped. “We’re going to need to take a look. Is that okay?”

Rachel nodded, so our fellow researcher proceeded to peel back the bottom of her shirt. But his hand near-immediately let it drop, and I tensed in disbelief. I had expected swollen skin. Maybe a bruise, a cut, or something that would explain what was happening to Rachel. Something within the realm of science.

What I had not expected was to see Rachel’s *ribcage*. To see a hole in her flesh.

Howard and I finally let loose a joined screech as we saw the hole in our friend’s stomach start to enlarge. Skin, around the opening’s edge, was vanishing into thin air, as if it were being consumed by invisible teeth. The ribcage itself bore growing gaps from the invisible nightmare gnawing away at Rachel from the inside. And behind that disappearing skeleton, there were no innards — not even desecrated innards. In the emptiest of Rachel’s skin-outfit, there were crystals. Bulky, blue crystals stained with a smattering of reddish-brown.

Howard threw up so instantaneously that he didn’t manage to turn away, and a thick stream of vomit filled our friend’s body. This revolting sight, of course, sparked a round of projectile expulsion from my own crying lips.

Once Howard and I had finished, I moved the torch beam up her body so we wouldn’t have to look at the awful, widening opening any longer. Rachel’s face, completely devoid of colour, looked back at me. Her eyes were harrowing. Full of pain, but not quite pleading for an end, as she seemed unaware of what was happening to her.

Thankfully, she was too weak to look down.

There came the sound of Crenshaw’s footsteps disappearing into the black tunnel. He was exploring without any light at hand, seemingly tiring of waiting, and I looked up for a moment. Stared into the blackness, eyes tracking the sound of his fading steps.

Now, with no more adrenaline coursing through my veins, I am aware that I felt something. Something at the very far end of the tunnel. Something large, still, and malevolent. Something watching. Something, in spite of its great size, naked to the human eye.

“What’s wrong?” Rachel whined, her skin’s shade transitioning from white to blue.

“Nothing…” I lied quietly.

“*HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU STILL ALIVE?*” Howard yelled, sending himself into a splutter of coughs.

“Stop it, Howard,” I begged, before turning back to her. “You’re okay, Rachel. Everything’s going to be okay.”

“There are so many of them,” she whispered, eyes beginning to roll into the back of her head.

I shivered. “So many of what?”

My colleague smiled as a trickle of watery liquid squeezed out of her tightly-closed mouth. Not blood, as she seemed to have nothing left inside. It wasn’t really a smile, of course. The muscles moved her lips into the right position, but it was muscle memory. She wasn’t happy in that moment. She wasn’t even Rachel anymore.

Whatever grinned at us, it lifted a finger and tapped the blue, lifeless temple of my colleague.

“They’re up *there*,” she giggled, tapping repeatedly. “Upstairs. Chattering to each other. I hear them. Even now, they’re still so…”

And then Rachel, or whatever remained of her, extinguished.

I wailed in horror and sorrow, though the knot in my chest had, admittedly, loosened. To see Rachel’s torment end was a blessing.

“*Famished*,” Dr Crenshaw said, completing the lifeless woman’s unfinished sentence.

Without a moment’s hesitation, I shot the torch upwards and looked away from Rachel’s corpse.

The expedition leader had not vanished into the blackness of the cave. Or, if he had, he’d somehow silently returned to his original standing position at its mouth. His back, once more, was turned to us, and he eyeballed the empty tunnel ahead. Dr Crenshaw was not the same as he had been, however, which drew more horrified yelps from Howard and me.

The back of our leader’s head was *missing*. His skin bore an open wound which seemed to be growing wider and wider as something unseen munched away.

“They’re up there,” Rachel had said.

Howard and I no longer wanted answers. We rose to our feet and crept backwards, reversing towards the slope.

“We’re going to get help,” Howard feebly promised as we both started to turn, preparing to hastily ascend to safety.

I kept my torch beam on the floor below, illuminating Dr Crenshaw, who still refused to turn and face us. But as Howard and I followed the spiralling staircase upwards, the side of our leader’s body came into view. The side of his face.

Once we were near-directly above the frozen, mutilated man, Howard clutched tightly to my shaking body, and I leaned over the edge of the slope, casting the torch downwards.

“Please stay there,” I weakly requested, eyeballing the statue beneath our feet.

Terrifyingly, I did not feel fear for Dr Crenshaw, but for my fleeing colleague and me. A feeling justified by the project leader’s head snapping backwards. I nearly slipped over the edge, saved only by Howard’s firm grip, as Crenshaw’s face cranked upwards. Only there was no face left at all.

“They are too small to be seen,” the man whispered without a mouth — without vocal cords. “We enter their home, and they enter ours.”

Dr Crenshaw’s eyes, glazed and aimless like those we’d seen on Rachel, sat above a stretching opening in his face — what had once been his face. His mouth and nose had been consumed by that unstoppable, unseen mass. Then, when the wound eventually swallowed his eyeballs, Howard and I watched each of those tearful spheres turn into red and white mist. Mist swallowed, like everything else, by thin air.

Only holes remained, cutting a tunnel from the front to the back of Crenshaw’s head. The beam of my torch bored straight through to the other side for a drawn-out second, then the man’s body crumpled into a lifeless, near-skinless mound, much like Rachel. The two corpses would, in little time at all, become nothing more than mounds of bloody clothes.

Then came skittering from the cave’s bowels. A cacophony of overlapping skittering noises, which sounded to me like an untold number of feet. Tiny moving, relatively to their mass, at an unfathomable speed. Howard and I saw nothing of the sort, of course.

*They are too small to be seen.*

But the cave floor, ten feet under our watching point on the staircase, started to darken, as if some mass of enormity were approaching — battalions of things only visible once they had collected in immeasurable numbers.

Scientific curiosity did not get the best of us. We did not wait to see the unknown *things* up close. Howard and I rushed up the spiral staircase. Rushed at such speed that we nearly tripped over the sides, falling to our deaths. We ran until we were winded, then we kept running. Even as the skittering started to sound along the walls, pursuing us towards the stairwell’s exit.

But they did not follow us out of the top. Did not follow us into the rainforest. We made it. We had collapsed, lungs deflated and bodies crying in pain, but we made it. That was why it took me a few minutes to notice. Notice what was out of place. I was still processing all that had happened.

Howard wasn’t breathing.

I crawled over to his body, barely able to speak, and sobbed when I found him in the mud. I don’t know how he managed to run up the staircase. There was nothing left of him in the dirt but bones and a few remaining strips of skin on his skull.

Tears soaking my skin, I unclipped Howard’s rucksack from the back of his half-body, and the man haunted me one final time by twisting onto his back — twisting to face me. I didn’t move him. He moved himself. Moved of his own accord.

The rest is little more than blurry blotches in my memory. A blur of physical and mental anguish. I’m amazed that I’m here to tell this tale at all. That, in my state, I succeeded in scaling down the inselberg’s vertical side. That I made it to the airport, flew back to Paris, and collapsed in my bed.

Precisely ninety hours and one hundred missed calls later, the adrenaline seems to have evacuated my system. It was only tonight that I found myself gripped by a fresh horror. I woke, in the middle of the night, to the return of that unfixable itch. It was barely a tickle in the cave. Now, I’m burning alive. But I’m so cold.

I keep scratching. And with every fresh scratch, clumps of skin come away. Wounds form, and they grow on their own. I am being consumed from the inside out. Eaten by things too small to see.

I don’t know how those things escaped, but they did. Don’t know how I survived so long whilst the others perished so quickly. How I made it down the mountain, onto a plane, and back to France.

Except I do know. I know because I hear the chattering voices in my head. The voices which serve that thing back in the cave. The thing which watched me from the dark.

They did not kill me quickly because they wanted me to make it back to the world of mankind. Wanted me to transport them out of their cave. They needed a host. And now *they* are the explorers. Discovering our world. Our home. A place that, for whatever reason, they weren’t able to reach until I entered their den and carried them free.

*We enter their home, and they enter ours.*

If I’d known, I would’ve remained in that isolated sky-forest to die. But it’s too late.

You see, I noticed it on the plane, but I thought I’d lost my mind. Thought I’d simply been affected by the trauma of what I experienced at the bottom of the stairwell. But I wasn’t imagining things.

The passengers started scratching their flesh. By the end of the flight, every last person on that flight was clawing irritably at their skin. It’s out in the world now. You’re not safe. Nobody’s safe because they’re too small to see. Too small, and too quick.

Forgive us for what we did.

NoSleep,I Regret Entering the Abandoned Mansion... The Paintings Were Watching Me.,"You might think I’m stupid for posting this, admitting to a crime. And yeah, you’re probably right. But I don’t care anymore. The person I used to be, the guy who broke into a stranger’s home for thrills and a quick payday? He’s long gone. My name doesn’t matter—you can call me whatever you want. Let’s just say this is your anonymous warning.

This all started three years ago, back when I was still pulling small-time jobs, mostly houses in affluent neighborhoods. I wasn’t a mastermind or anything, just someone with sticky fingers and a knack for finding ways inside. When I heard about the abandoned Greystone Mansion, I thought it was the perfect score. The place had been sitting empty for decades, and rumors swirled about treasures left behind by the original owners.

Of course, there were also stories about why no one stayed in the mansion for long. Ghosts, curses, people vanishing without a trace—your usual small-town nonsense. But I figured those stories kept the amateurs out, leaving more for me. I drove out one moonless night with a flashlight, a crowbar, and a backpack, ready to haul away anything that looked remotely valuable.

The mansion sat in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by overgrown trees and weeds as tall as me. The windows were mostly shattered, and ivy climbed its walls like nature was trying to reclaim the place. Inside, the air was heavy with the smell of mildew, and every step I took on the creaking floorboards echoed through the silence.

I hit the usual spots first—drawers, cabinets, anything that might hold old jewelry or forgotten cash. Found nothing but dust and rats. Still, I wasn’t ready to give up. The mansion was huge, with more rooms than I could count. There had to be something worth taking.

That’s when I saw the portraits.

They lined the walls of a long hallway on the second floor, each one larger than life and painted with unnerving detail. At first, I thought they were just your typical old-money portraits—stuffy men in suits, stern-looking women in elegant dresses. But the longer I looked, the more they unsettled me.

The faces weren’t just detailed; they were too lifelike. The paint seemed to glisten in the faint light of my flashlight, and the eyes... God, the eyes. They followed me wherever I went, their gazes drilling into my back even when I wasn’t looking at them directly.

But that wasn’t what stopped me in my tracks. No, what froze me to the spot was the last portrait in the hallway.

It was blank.

At first, I thought it was just an empty frame, but when I stepped closer, I saw faint outlines—shapes that seemed to shift and twist the longer I stared. And at the bottom of the frame, there was a small brass plaque with a single word etched into it: *“Unfinished.”*

A cold dread started creeping over me, but I shook it off. This was just a painting, I told myself. A creepy one, sure, but just a painting. I turned to leave the hallway, but something caught my eye—a small, leather-bound book sitting on a pedestal near the blank portrait.

Curiosity got the better of me. The book looked ancient, its pages yellowed and brittle. The text was handwritten in a language I didn’t recognize, though some of it looked like Latin. Near the back of the book was a crude drawing of the hallway I was standing in, complete with the portraits—and a set of instructions.

The words were written in shaky English:  
*""Stand before the Unfinished. Speak the names of the Chosen. Do not falter.""*

I should have left right then and there. Tossed the book, bolted down the stairs, and never looked back. But I didn’t.

Instead, I flipped back through the book, scanning the faded text for any mention of these ""Chosen."" There they were—names, dozens of them, written in a tight, slanted script. They were eerily familiar, though I couldn’t place where I’d heard them before.

Then, almost without thinking, I found myself standing in front of the blank portrait, the book open in my hands.

As I stared at the empty canvas, my flashlight flickered and died, plunging the hallway into darkness. The silence pressed in on me like a weight, and for a moment, I considered running. But something held me there—a morbid curiosity, maybe, or sheer stupidity.

I whispered the first name on the list.

Nothing happened.

Then the second name.

Still nothing.

But as I spoke the third, I heard it—a faint rustling, like fabric brushing against the walls. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end as the sound grew louder, circling me, closing in.

I fumbled for my flashlight, but it wouldn’t turn on. My heart pounded as I flipped through the book, trying to figure out what I’d unleashed. That’s when I felt it—a presence behind me, so close I could feel its breath on my neck.

I spun around, but there was nothing there. Just the portraits, their eyes gleaming in the darkness.

No, not just the portraits.

They were moving.

The figures inside the frames shifted and writhed, their painted expressions twisting into something unrecognizable. Their eyes burned with a malevolent light, and one by one, they began to step out of their frames.

Panic surged through me as I dropped the book and ran, the sound of footsteps—no, *many* footsteps—chasing me down the hallway.

I didn’t stop until I was out of the mansion, my chest heaving and my hands trembling. I never went back for the book, and I’ve spent every day since trying to convince myself it was all just a bad dream.

But I know the truth.

The eyes in those portraits weren’t just paintings. They were people—real people, trapped in those frames, waiting for someone stupid enough to set them free.

And the worst part?

When I got back to my car, I caught my reflection in the window.

For just a split second, my face didn’t look like my own.

It looked like a painting.

I didn’t go back to the mansion right away. For weeks, I kept telling myself to move on, to forget. But ignoring what happened wasn’t as easy as I thought it would be.

It started small. At first, I’d feel like someone was standing behind me when I was alone. Just a faint pressure, like the air shifting. I told myself it was paranoia, the fallout of a bad break-in that shook me up.

Then things got worse.

It wasn’t just a feeling anymore. I began to notice people watching me—or at least, I thought they were. A guy sitting across from me on the bus would stare until I turned to meet his eyes. Then he’d suddenly glance away, like nothing had happened. In line at the coffee shop, a woman behind me would shift uncomfortably, her head angled slightly in my direction. When I turned, she’d be looking at the menu, her face calm and unreadable.

At first, I chalked it up to coincidence. The mind plays tricks when you’re on edge, right? But it kept happening.

It wasn’t just random strangers, either. It was everyone.

Even people I knew—friends, acquaintances, the guy at the bodega who rang me up every morning—they all started to do it. I’d catch them looking at me from the corner of my eye, their expressions blank, neutral. But when I turned my head, they’d act like nothing had happened.

And then there were the smiles.

Not big ones. Not obvious. Just the faintest curl of their lips, like they were sharing some private joke I wasn’t in on. It was subtle, almost imperceptible—but once I noticed, I couldn’t unsee it.

They all looked like they knew something.

By the end of the second month, I’d stopped sleeping. Every time I closed my eyes, I’d picture the hallway in the mansion, the way the portraits had moved, their hollow faces and grasping hands. I knew it wasn’t over. Whatever I’d set free, it was still with me.

I finally broke one night after a particularly bad encounter. I was walking home from the grocery store, arms weighed down by bags, when I passed an old man sitting on a bench. He wasn’t doing anything—just sitting there, staring straight ahead.

As I passed, I glanced at him, and his head turned to follow me.

It wasn’t a normal movement. It was too smooth, too precise. Like the way the portraits had moved.

I stopped dead in my tracks, the plastic bags digging into my hands. The old man didn’t blink.

“Can I help you?” I asked, trying to sound casual, but my voice cracked on the last word.

He didn’t answer. He just smiled. Not a warm smile, not a kind one—just that faint, knowing curl of his lips.

I staggered, the bag slipping from my grip as a few cans clattered to the ground. I didn’t stop to pick them up—I just left them behind and ran the rest of the way home.

The next morning, I packed my things. I couldn’t explain it, but I knew staying in the city wasn’t safe anymore. Maybe it was paranoia, but I didn’t care. I moved to a new town, rented a cheap room in a run-down motel, and tried to start over.

For a while, it worked.

The people here were friendly but distant. I kept my head down, took odd jobs to pay the bills, and avoided unnecessary conversations. For the first time in months, I felt almost normal again.

But it didn’t last.

One day, I was fixing a fence for a farmer on the edge of town when I felt it again—that prickle on the back of my neck. The feeling of being watched. I glanced up, and there was a woman standing at the edge of the field, half-hidden by the tall grass.

She wasn’t moving.

Her face was partially obscured, but I could tell she was staring right at me.

I called out to her, but she didn’t respond. She just turned and walked away, vanishing into the grass without a sound.

That night, I sat on the edge of my bed, staring at my hands. The scar on my palm from the night I shattered the display case in an antique shop had healed into a thin white line, but it still throbbed whenever I thought about the mansion.

I realized then that running wasn’t going to help.

Whatever this was, it wasn’t tied to a place. It was tied to me.

I guess something in me snapped that night. Maybe it was desperation, or maybe I thought destroying the mansion would sever the connection. I didn’t plan it—I just acted.

I grabbed a can of gasoline from the shed behind my motel and drove back to Greystone in the dead of night. The mansion loomed ahead, its silhouette even darker against the moonless sky. The air was heavy, suffocating, as I stepped inside.

The portraits were waiting, their painted eyes alive with something far worse than malice. I couldn’t bring myself to look too closely, afraid I’d see them move again. Their gazes followed me down the hall as I worked, splashing gasoline on the walls, the floors, and the ornate frames that held those cursed faces.

When I reached for the matchbox, my hands were trembling so badly that I dropped it. It hit the floor with a clatter, spilling matches in every direction. My heart nearly stopped as I watched the tiny sticks scatter across the soaked floorboards, a few skittering dangerously close to the gasoline.

I cursed under my breath, trying to keep my cool and avoid stepping on the gasoline—because that would be a really bad idea. Crouching low, I grabbed the nearest match that hadn’t been doused. My fingers fumbled as the oppressive silence seemed to press in, my heartbeat loud in my ears.

With shaking hands, I struck it.

The flame sputtered to life, impossibly bright in the darkness. Without a second thought, I tossed it onto the gasoline-soaked floor and scrambled back as the fire erupted in a wave of heat and light.

The fire roared to life, devouring everything in its path. The portraits twisted and warped in the heat, their colors bleeding and melting into one another.

For a moment, I thought I heard them screaming.

I didn’t stick around to find out.

I ran in a panic, the flames roaring at my heels as I sprinted toward the door. When I finally stumbled outside, the mansion was engulfed, its windows glowing like fiery eyes piercing the night. I stood there, gasping for breath, watching as the inferno devoured everything.

I went home to my apartment believing it was over—that I’d destroyed whatever evil had taken hold of that place.

I couldn’t have been more wrong.

The next morning, I went back to Greystone.

Or at least, what was left of it. The fire I’d set had gutted the mansion completely, leaving behind little more than a pile of ash and charred stone. The front steps still stood, blackened but intact, leading up to nothing but sky.

I stood there for a long time, staring at the ruins, trying to figure out what to do. Then I saw it.

Amid the rubble, something caught the light. A glint of metal.

I climbed over the crumbling remains of the doorway and picked my way through the wreckage. When I reached the spot where the hallway had been, I found it: a brass plaque, scorched but still legible.

*""Unfinished.""*

My stomach turned.

I didn’t touch it. I didn’t want to risk taking anything from this place ever again. But as I stood there, staring at the plaque, I felt something shift.

The air grew heavy, the way it does before a thunderstorm.

And then I heard it: faint at first, almost a whisper, but growing louder with every second.

Footsteps.

They were coming closer.

The footsteps echoed through the ruins of the mansion, slow and deliberate. At first, I thought they might belong to another unlucky thrill-seeker who had wandered into the wreckage, but something about them felt wrong.

They didn’t shuffle over broken debris or falter on the unstable ground. They were steady, rhythmic, like they belonged to someone who knew exactly where they were going.

I didn’t wait to see who—or what—it was.

Backing away from the plaque, I turned and scrambled over the rubble, ignoring the sharp edges scraping my hands and legs. I didn’t stop until I was outside, the morning sun barely cutting through the overcast sky.

But the footsteps didn’t stop.

They were still coming, their sound impossibly clear even though no one emerged from the wreckage. I stared at the empty doorway, my heart hammering in my chest, waiting for something to appear.

Then, I saw them.

Not in the doorway, but in the distance—figures standing along the edge of the property. There were five of them, maybe six, scattered among the overgrown grass and skeletal trees. At first, I thought they were strangers, maybe people from the nearby town curious about the mansion.

But they weren’t moving.

They just stood there, watching me.

Even though they were too far away for me to make out their faces, I knew they were staring. That same weight I’d felt for weeks was back, heavier than ever, pressing down on me like a vice.

I took a step back, and one of the figures shifted. Its head tilted slightly, as if acknowledging my movement.

Another step, and the others started to move too—not toward me, but around me, circling the ruins in perfect synchronization.

I don’t remember running to my car. One moment, I was standing there, frozen, and the next, I was behind the wheel, gripping the steering wheel so hard my knuckles turned white.

The drive back to town was a blur. My hands shook as I gripped the wheel, my eyes darting to the rearview mirror every few seconds. The road was empty, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was following me.

By the time I reached the motel, my head was pounding, and my legs felt like jelly. I locked the door behind me, shoved a chair under the handle, and collapsed onto the bed.

But the feeling didn’t go away.

I could sense them—standing just beyond the edge of my awareness, like shadows lingering in the corner of my eye. Every sound, every creak of the old building made me jump, my mind conjuring images of the figures standing outside my window, waiting for me to look.

That night, the first knock came.

I was sitting on the edge of the bed, the TV on low to drown out the silence, when I heard it—a soft, deliberate knock at the door.

Three slow raps, evenly spaced.

I froze, staring at the door. Then I remembered—the motel had no front desk, no housekeepers, and no reason for anyone to bother me at this hour.

Another knock, louder this time.

I grabbed the crowbar I’d brought back from Greystone and approached the door, my pulse racing.

“Who’s there?” I called out, my voice shaking.

No answer.

The third knock rattled the doorframe, and I almost dropped the crowbar.

I leaned in, peering through the peephole. The hallway outside was empty, but I knew better than to trust what I saw.

I stepped back, gripping the crowbar tighter, and the knock came again—this time from the window.

Spinning around, I saw nothing but the drawn curtains, but the sound was unmistakable. Someone—or something—was outside.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

For what felt like hours, the room was silent. Then I heard it: the faint creak of floorboards, not outside, but inside the room.

I turned, swinging the crowbar wildly, but there was no one there. The room was empty, exactly as I’d left it, but the sound of footsteps didn’t stop. They circled me, moving just beyond the edges of the light.

And then, the whispers started.

Faint and indistinct, like voices carried on a breeze. I couldn’t make out the words, but I didn’t need to. I knew what they wanted.

The figures. The portraits. The *Unfinished.*

They weren’t gone. They’d followed me, clinging to my very existence like a curse.

And now, they were done lurking.

The whispers swelled, overlapping until they merged into a single, deafening roar. Pain shot through my skull, as if it were splitting open, and I dropped the crowbar, clutching my ears in agony.

“Stop!” I screamed, but the voices only grew louder.

In the haze of noise and pain, I saw them—shapes materializing in the corners of the room, their faces smooth and featureless. They didn’t move like people. They glided, their limbs bending unnaturally as they closed in.

I stumbled, my foot catching on loose rubble and throwing me off balance. My hand shot out instinctively, reaching for the crowbar, but instead, it closed around something cold and metallic.

The plaque.

It shouldn’t have been there. I left it at the mansion, I was sure of it, but there it was, sitting on the motel desk as if it had always been there.

The figures stopped, their blank faces turning toward the plaque in unison.

I had no idea what I was doing, but I grabbed it anyway, clutching it like a shield.

“Is... is this what you want?” I shouted, my voice trembling as the words stumbled out.

The figures froze, their heads tilting as if considering the question. Then, one by one, they began to retreat, fading into the shadows until the room was empty again.

The silence that followed was suffocating.

I stared at the plaque, the word “Unfinished” gleaming faintly in the dim light. Deep down, I understood—this wasn’t the end.

It was the start of something far worse.

I didn’t sleep that night. How could I? Every sound, every flicker of a shadow felt like one of those figures returning, lurking just out of sight in the corners of my room.

By dawn, I came to a grim conclusion: I couldn’t keep running.

Whatever this was, it wouldn’t stop until I faced it.

The plaque sat on the motel desk, its brass surface tarnished and dull, but the word etched into it—*Unfinished*—seemed to pulse faintly, like it was alive. I didn’t know what it wanted me to do, but I had a feeling the mansion held the answers. Or what was left of it.

I returned to Greystone as the sun rose higher, the ruins almost peaceful under the light. But the calm was deceptive. The air still carried that oppressive weight, like the place itself was watching me.

I walked through the rubble, my boots crunching on charred wood and shattered stone, until I reached the heart of the mansion. The plaque seemed to grow heavier in my hand the closer I got, like it was pulling me toward something.

And then I saw it: a trapdoor, partially obscured by debris. I don’t know how I’d missed it before—it looked old, the wood scorched but still intact, with a rusted iron handle.

I hesitated, every instinct screaming at me to leave, but I couldn’t ignore the pull of the plaque. I knelt and yanked the trapdoor open.

Beneath it was a set of stone stairs spiraling into darkness.

The air grew colder as I descended, the faint smell of ash giving way to something earthier—damp soil, rotting wood. My flashlight barely pierced the gloom, but the stairs went on and on, deeper than should’ve been possible.

Finally, I reached the bottom.

The room was small, the walls carved directly into the stone, and at its center was a pedestal. On it rested an object covered in a dark, tattered cloth.

I approached slowly, the plaque in my hand vibrating slightly, as if urging me forward. With a deep breath, I reached out and pulled the cloth away.

Underneath was another painting.

It was just like the others, the frame ornate and gilded, the canvas impossibly detailed. But this one wasn’t of a person. It was of a scene.

A field, overgrown and wild, with a single figure standing in the distance. It looked familiar, but I couldn’t place why—until I realized the perspective was mine.

The painting showed *me*, standing where I’d been earlier that morning, staring back at the mansion.

As I stared at the painting, the figure in it began to move, turning slowly to face me. Its features were blurred, distorted, but its posture was unmistakable.

It wasn’t just watching me. It was mimicking me.

And then it smiled.

The walls of the room trembled, dust raining from the ceiling as the figure in the painting stepped closer. My flashlight flickered, and the air grew thick, almost liquid, making it harder to breathe.

I staggered back, clutching the plaque like a lifeline. The figure reached the edge of the canvas, its distorted features pressing against the surface as if trying to break free.

I didn’t think. I just acted.

Raising the plaque, I slammed it into the painting with all my strength. The canvas tore with a sound like a scream, the edges curling and blackening as the room erupted into chaos.

The walls cracked, the floor buckled, and the pedestal crumbled into dust. A deafening roar filled the air as shadows poured from the painting, swirling around me like a storm.

I ran, scrambling back up the stairs as the room collapsed behind me. The shadows clawed at my heels, their whispers deafening, but I didn’t stop. I burst through the trapdoor just as the last of the staircase crumbled into darkness.

When I reached the surface, the ruins were still. The oppressive weight that had hung over the mansion was gone, replaced by an eerie calm.

The plaque was gone too, along with the shadows.

For the first time in months, I felt... free.

That was three years ago. I’ve tried to move on, to live a normal life, but there’s always a part of me that wonders.

The mansion’s ruins were cleared a few months after I left, the land sold to a developer. They built a row of luxury homes there, all sleek glass and polished stone. I read about it in the paper, saw photos of smiling families posing in front of their new homes.

But I can’t help wondering if they feel it too. That faint pressure, that sense of being watched.

I’ve stopped looking over my shoulder, stopped jumping at shadows. But sometimes, late at night, when I’m alone in a room, I’ll catch the faintest sound.

Footsteps.

Not close. No.

But they’re there.

They’re always there.

NoSleep,The Mushrooms Are Not What They Seem...,"This happened a few years ago. To be honest, I’m only now ready to get it all off my chest.  

It was Halloween and the parties were insane that night. The tips in leftover candy almost made working that night worth it. The last house of the night belonged to a person I hated. Actually, to the person I hated the most in the world.  

Back before I got into college, I did some dumb stuff. Or, mostly the group I hung around did some dumb stuff. We were bored without any cash to entertain ourselves. The one time we took it too far and broke into our high school at night to trash it. I hung back and mostly watched. I did doodle on some chalkboards and arranged the dead animals in jars from the science room around the school for people to find. I didn’t do that much damage, but I watched my friends cause trouble. I regret my teenage actions and have been trying since then to be a better person.   

Ken somehow found out about what we were going to do back then. He recorded the crime but did not hand it in to the police, but to use the footage for blackmail. If he emailed that recording to my college that was it. I would be kicked out. In all those years he only demanded free food from my jobs leaving me to foot the bill. It was entirely possible the recording wasn’t clear enough to build a case on, but I hadn’t wanted to take that risk.  

I wanted to put it all past me. I didn't even know why I let myself hang around people like that back then. That Halloween I decided I refused to be blackmailed any longer. I would confront Ken and make him pay for his own damn pizzas. 

I knocked on the door as hard as I could to be heard over the music. It took a while before someone answered. The costumes that night so far were all pretty creative. When I saw the one who opened the door it made me pause. His makeup was too damn good. It made my skin crawl in a way I didn’t expect. It was a simple costume and yet it worked. The one side of his face looked as if mushrooms were growing out of his cheek. His eyes were a dull blue as if he was a corpse. When he smiled it looked as if he wasn’t really looking at me but rather at something else no but him could see. This guy was mostly likely high as a kite.   

“There is a nice lady at the door.” He said over his shoulder to no one behind him. 

The music poured from the open doorway and I hesitated. I could just go inside and confront Ken, but didn’t want to do so if there was a crowd. From the sounds of it, there were at least a few people inside. I waited for someone else to come by for a few minutes. When there was no sign of that happening, I asked the man who answered the door if I could see Ken. He nodded stepping aside. Honestly, the guy was a bit of an airhead and I couldn’t help but like him. Even with that creepy costume. What on Earth was a guy like this doing at Ken’s place?  

I walked into the living room, the music getting louder. Scanning the room, I spotted my mortal enemy, and he noticed me at the same time. The party was just some loud music with a small crowd of his good-for-nothing friends all smoking and drinking. It made the room smell awful; I already had a headache. Ken walked over, his face hadn’t aged a day since high school.  He was tall and skinny. His front teeth were a bit too large for his mouth and his eyes were a bit too small and dark giving him a rat-like appearance. Rat Face was a nickname that stuck with people behind his back. He said something but I couldn’t head a damn thing over the music. We needed to step halfway through the hallway to talk.  

“I don’t see any pizzas in your hand.” He said with that rodent grin of his.  

“I don’t see any cash in yours.” I shot back arms crossed. 

He almost looked scared for a second someone was standing up to him. The mushroom guy from before was coming our way, not even aware of the fight that was about to happen. I didn’t think he was aware of much right then. Ken reached out to grab his wrist and pulled the guy in closer. From what I heard Ken didn’t care about anything when I came to partners. As long as he could get into someone’s pants, he was happy. I didn’t like this. I didn’t like any of this. The mushroom guy was barely present. Ken shouldn’t be around someone like that. Without any doubt, he would take advantage of this guy if I left them alone. Hell, I bet Ken was the one who loaded him up.  

“You need to get people high to get them to even touch you?” I said disgusted. “What’s his name? I’m getting him home and taking your pizzas with me if you don’t pay for them.”  

“Aw Gary, she’s being so mean. We even ordered them with extra mushrooms for you. He likes mushrooms in case you can’t tell.” Ken wasn’t taking my threats seriously.   

He let out a cackling laugh that got on my every nerve.   

“Gary, sweetie you can leave with me if you want. I’ll get you home.”  I offered hoping my voice got through to him.  

“He wants to stay. I didn’t even give him anything. He came like this. A nice little guy we stumbled into. He'll do anything you’ll ask. Like, anything. We wanted to see how far we can take those requests tonight, you know after we eat some pizza. Isn’t that right Gary?”  

I could have punched Ken’s little rat teeth out. I looked down at the mushroom-covered face expecting some sort of worried or confused expression. Gary simply smiled and nodded as if we were talking about the weather. Ken had to be lying that Gary wasn't drugged up. That far off look in his eyes simply wasn’t natural. I couldn't leave him here with other dirtbags like Ken. I reached out my hand to grab Gary, only to have Ken pull him in closer.  

“Pizzas for my new friend, please. Or do you think I only have one video of you? One of the girls owed me something and I got her to record a bunch of you changing back in school. If you don’t listen to me, that is going to be put on the internet before you can scream.”  

He was bluffing, he had to be. My face grew pale and my hands started to shake. No one would do something like that for him. I thought back to school of how many times I’d gotten changed after gym class. Thankfully I always went very quickly and never fully got undressed.   

“You know that shit is illegal right? You’ll-” I started and his squeaking laugh cut me off.  

“Do you know how hard that is to get taken down? And how many pervs will see it before you can even get one video removed? I can make it so it’s never leaked back to me. And it’s your word against mine! So run along and-”  

This time I cut him off. I punched him as hard as I could in his face. His nose gushing blood the moment I pulled my fist back. I was so sick and tired of his bullshit. He lived his entire life making up lies trying to make himself appear like a hot shot and I bought into it for too long. This bastard already took up far too much of my time thinking about him and dreading a video that might not even be real. Within seconds I lost all sense of reason. I got him on the ground and unloaded years of frustration into his face. And I soon realized this wasn’t all just for me. I’ve heard so many stories of him tormenting every person he ever comes across. How many girls had he recorded without their permission? If it was even just one, he deserved this beat down.   

He got some blows in. My nose also started to bleed and he was able to yank out some hair when he ripped off my hat. Overall, I was winning.  

A friend of his noticed what was going on. A set of hands lifted me from under my arms and I was dragged kicking and screaming out of the house. I swear if someone didn’t pry me off of Ken, I would have killed him. I was placed on the front porch to calm down. No one called the cops because they didn’t want that kind of attention.  

A while passed and I couldn’t bring myself to leave. I just sat, dabbing at my bleeding nose.  

The door opened and Gary came out with my hat and a red scarf. He handed me both.   

“It’s cold out. The scarf should help.” He said sitting beside me.   

His calm smile helped me settle down. I really didn’t want to leave him behind and was glad I got some punches into Ken for even considering taking advantage of this guy. I used the scarf to clean off some of the blood and put my hat back on.   

“Do you really understand what is going to happen to you if you stay? I can take you anywhere you want.” I should have just grabbed him and dragged him away.  

In the back of my mind, I was certain Ken really did have something on me and would drop it all online if I took away his new plaything. He might already have done it as revenge after getting his ass kicked. Gary paused to look off into the distance considering his choices. When he finally smiled again, I wanted to believe he would be alright.  

“I like making new friends. I’ll be fine. I'm tough, I won’t do anything I don’t want to do. I promise.”   

I chewed on the inside of my mouth still on the fence about leaving him. I would have pressed the matter if a car hadn’t pulled up next to mine. A friend of mine rushed out towards us, his face twisted in concern.   

“Aiden, what are you doing here?” I asked having no idea why he just arrived.  

We’ve known each other since high school. I’ve had a crush on him for years. One I never acted on always feeling as if he was way out of my league. He knew of Ken, but I didn’t think he knew where he lived.  

“One of the guys called me. Did you really get in a fight?” Aiden asked the moment he stopped in front of us.  

“Uh yeah. A bit.” I admitted a bit embarrassed.  

“Your face is all messed up. Go head home. Wait are you working? Call your boss then head home.”   

I dreaded what my face looked like in that moment. I really didn’t want him to see me like this. I should get cleaned up and I was pretty much done work that night.   

“I can’t leave Gary. He's to mice. These guys-”  

Aiden helped me to my feet, his perfect face turning into a smile that made my face flush.  

“I’ll take care of him, ok? We all wanted to beat up Ken. You’ve done a public service tonight to let me take care of the rest.”  

I nodded, unable to go against him. I gave Gary one last look. His kind face makes his gruesome makeup appear softer. Before I left, Aiden paid for the pizzas so I wouldn’t get in trouble with my boss for that. He offered to let me keep them but I couldn’t stomach them. I handed them off to him and told him to make sure Gary ate and got home safely. He promised to call me later. With that settled, I got into my car to report back to work. My boss was startled by my appearance and I fessed up on what happened. Unless someone made a complaint, he said I could keep my job. Which I really needed if I wanted to pay for college.  

I wished that was the end of what happened. I was dragged into the whole Ken mess again a few days after the fight. One of the guys at the party also went to the same college as me. I never noticed him before. He flagged me down in the hallway to talk.  

According to him, Ken was hiding at his place and refused to let anyone see him. It had been a few days after Halloween and his friends wanted to party. With Ken’s house unavailable, they didn’t have anywhere else to go. They’d seen me speak with Gary and assumed we knew each other. The group of friends wanted Gary’s number because he was the only one still over at Ken’s place.  

My blood ran cold hearing that. The bastard could be doing anything to that poor guy. I told the truth that I didn’t know how to contact him. I then skipped my next class to head right over to get Gary out of there. Did he go back because he wanted to be there? Or was Ken forcing him to stay?  

I raced to his house and pounded on his door. His car was out front so I knew he was home. Shouting at him to open up, I tried the handle to find it unlocked. I shouldn’t be sticking my nose in their business. Walking into his place to drag out someone who might be his boyfriend was wrong on my part. But the thought of that rat bastard touching Gary motivated me in a way I didn’t understand. I’ve never met someone I instantly felt like I needed to protect before.  

Inside the house was dark. A musty smell stung my eyes. My motivation faded as I walked down the hallway to the living room looking for any signs of life. This place smelled rotten and almost Earthy. Once I checked the main room, I would call the cops for a wellness check. Something died in here and I feared it was an innocent person.   

The living room was a mess. Trash scattered around and beer cans littered the floor. At first, I didn’t even recognize the brown mass in the corner as something human. A groan pulled my eyes over trying to see in the dim light. A small whisper begging for help came as that pile moved.  

I scream bubbled up in my throat. What I was seeing couldn’t be real. It just couldn’t. Ken was painfully crawling across the floor. His body was covered with mushrooms sprouting from his skin. When he raised his head, half his face was completely overrun by them.  

“I feel sick. Please... call a doctor...” He begged; his word muffled by more of the fungus inside his mouth.  

I nearly puked seeing it. Shaking my head, no matter how much I wanted the sight to go away it remained. For a brief second, I questioned how such a thing could happen. All at once, the answer came as the person I came here for walked into the room. Half his face still was covered in sprouting mushrooms. The kind smile didn’t match the tone of the room. He got down to rest his chin on his knees as he watched Ken attempt to drag himself away.  

“Y-You...” I sputtered not knowing what I was going to ask.  

Reaching out, he plucked one of the mushrooms off Ken’s arms to start placing it on the side of his face to add it to the others.   

“I told him not to go this far but he went through with it anyway. I warned him and yet... But that’s alright. He forced me to be his friend. I like making new friends even if I sometimes don’t like the process. This way he’ll be with me forever. It was his choice you know.”  

I felt dizzy hearing those words. I had been wanting to protect Gary unaware he could handle himself. A noise coming from the hallway made my body jolt. I turned my head to see a form stumble into the room, skin covered with the same kind of white glittering mushrooms that belonged to Gary. The person collapsed to the ground, a hand weakly stretched and a raspy voice pleading for some water. Through the mushrooms, I recognized him. 

“I don’t understand. You shouldn’t even be here...” I choked out, tears flooding my sight.  

“Aiden became my friend too.”  

He had come over to Ken’s house that night to party and use Ken’s new toy. He lied that someone called him over. And I had fallen for it.  

A scream rose in my chest. I looked at the two on the ground, barely moving feeling a mixture of pity and fear. They made the choice that caused all this to happen to them. And for a moment, I felt an odd pull towards them. Toward Gary. I blacked out for a moment. My feet take uneven steps close to the monster in the room.  

“You’re too good of a person to become my friend.” Gary’s voice caused me to snap back to my senses.  

He smiled and his blue eyes appeared clear. I had done some awful things in the past. I should be joining these two and yet I was rejected to be given a second chance. My lungs felt heavy as I turned to flee from the house. Leaving behind a person I hated and a person I loved to rot.   

I called the police and by some miracle kept my voice steady so they weren’t aware I knew more than I was letting on. They did a welfare check and found two bodies covered in mushrooms. A sight no one in that department had ever seen before.  There were no signs of Gary ever being there aside from Ken’s friends describing him.  

My lungs haven’t felt the same since that day. I’ve gone to doctors and they can’t see anything wrong with them. Most nights I find myself awake, staring at the ceiling, feeling an odd pull deep within my chest. Some nights I just want to leave. To let go. Quit my job, forget school, and go on the run. Steal when I need to get by until I find Gary again. This desire scares me more than the thought of death. I don’t want to lose myself. To become one with all the other mushrooms that make up his body. Whatever Gary is, he’s willing to welcome anyone into himself as long as you give up your humanity. No, everything that you are. I would heavily advise staying away from him if you ever cross his path. But the choice to be his friend or not is up to you.

NoSleep,We found the perfect house today. But we didn't know what nightmare waited behind its doors...,"We got the big house as we wanted. But what the hell is happening here …

I don’t know where I have to start the story. Let me type everything quickly before my mobile batteries run out. Sorry for my bad English.

This morning! It’s raining outside…I called the house broker. He attended the call and started “Sorry bro. I can’t find a big house like you asked. This town is not that much developed, so I unable to find a house that is big as you want”

I replied “No. Did you search on the mountainside?. I heard that there are a lot of options there.”. 

“No. I didn’t. That area is a bit remote and roads are not good.”

“But we can just give it a try.”, I said to him.

“Okay bro. I will come”

I reached the mountainside entrance of the town ‘Twine Meaks’. It’s still raining. The broker was waiting in a tea shop. 

“Welcome bro. Why do you need to hurry in this rain” he asked.

“Rain will pour for 3 days. So no point of waiting”

“So as I said to you, we are a joint family. My grandpa has 5 children and each of them has 3-4 children and each of those children has 2 children. So Imagine its size. That’s why I need lots of bedrooms and halls.”

“Oh, I got it. But it’s a bit difficult to find. No problem. Let me ask the town people.”

We drove for an hour asking many people but everybody said the same.

After some time I saw a weird old man. One side of his beard is white and the other side is thick black. He only wore underwear. His hair style looks like the Dome of Mosque. He was smoking in the pouring rain. I couldn’t understand how his cigarette remained lit in this downpour. . 

The broker called him.He reached our car. 

“I need to know about any palace-like houses here for  a large joint family”.

The old man smiled.

*“How long a home is, it doesn’t mean it will make your mind vivid” he replied.*

“Well sir, tell me about the house.”

*“No place is happier than home”.*

“Ooh man. Please tell us about the houses here”

*“Try to get into the heaven before they close the door”*

The broker got irritated. 

“Sir, we are not here to hear your quotes. Go to some school and write them there. Please guide us”.

*“Hahaha, Do you think the bigger the bedroom gets, the ‘lasting time’ in this world gets longer?”*

The broker pulled his shirt and tightened  it. “Mind your words and behave as per your age, you elder”.

I opened the car’s door and ran to them. 

“Hi guys, be calm… Sir, we just enquired about some houses. But you are speaking unrelated”.

The man was calm.Then we lifted his head and looked up.

“There is a house situated 3 KMS from here. You have to take a right turn from the Black Angel statue and follow the forest trail.” 

*“And before entering into the home, drink some Tea or Coffee and enrich your memory. And Remember and Remember and keep remembering!!!”*

My broker said “We are not old morons like you to forget things”. 

When we were about to start he peeked inside of the door and said *“One can cross the borders of the world. But no one can cross the borders of their mind and the time”.*

I smiled at the man. My broker yawned. We reached the house. The house looks good. But it doesn't seem like that much larger one. A medium sized house. 

The broker asked, “Did that old moron really understand what we asked?”

We entered the house. It looked nice. The hall was large, and had some sofas in the middle. The hall of the house is spacious and bright, with large windows letting in natural light. The walls are painted a soft, welcoming color, and a stylish chandelier hangs from the ceiling. A cozy, elegant sofa sits in the center, surrounded by tasteful decor and lush green plants. The floor is covered with a beautiful, patterned rug, adding warmth and charm to the space.

“Yeah. it seems good” I said.

“Well.. but we asked for a large palace kinda thing to that old moron. But since he might be suffering from Amnesia, he directed to a medium. “ 

“Okay. Let’s explore the house. We saw a lot of doors in the hall. I wondered why a house needs these many doors. Does it have a lot of rooms?.”

I opened one of the doors. I saw a room in some different architecture. A Moroccan type. I like it. 

That room had 14 doors. We opened one.  I saw a room in some other architecture. An Iranian type. Wow. It's different . 

That room had 26 doors. We opened one.  I saw a room in some other architecture. An Italian type. Awesome!  . 

That room had 53 doors. We opened one. I saw a room in some other architecture. A Japanese type. Amazing!

That room had 45 doors. We opened one. I saw a room in some other architecture. A French type. Beautiful!

That room had 62 doors. We opened one. I saw a room in some other architecture. An Indian type. Fascinating!

That room had 24 doors. We opened one. I saw a room in some other architecture. A Greek type. Stunning!

WAIT!!!!

What’s happening now. 

We keep on opening a lot of  rooms with different different architectures like a never ending loop. And there are lots and lots of doors per room. 

We became tired.

I asked the house broker “What’s happening here?”

He replied “I think this house has lot of rooms”

“Yeah, a lot of rooms”

“Okay broker, I am satisfied with it. Let’s go and connect with the owner”

“But, hey, who is the owner?”

Yes. We didn’t ask the old man. We came here and just opened the main door.

“That old moron doesn’t have a common sense to tell us about the owner of the house” , broker again.

“Okay man, whatever, let’s go and meet someone outside or the old man again”

“I will not be ready to go to prison for the murder of that moron  by meeting him again”, my broker is still angry with him. 

“Okay. Let’s leave”.

“We opened some of the room doors. But I stopped at a room. 

“Hi, which door to open? There are 53 doors here. Which door did we come by?” the broker asked.

“No man. I forgot. But I remember the east side. But here 13 doors are in the east.”

Some minutes later, we opened a door at random. We saw another room. I didn’t remember whether I had seen or not. 

“Man… it has 44 doors. Which door do we have to go to?”

“I don’t know. Just keep on opening in direction we came”

“But, I remember we switched directions sometimes. Right?

“Yes. Correct.”

We keep on opening doors and passing rooms.

I felt tired. I couldn’t proceed further.

“Let’s go man”, the broker said.

“We are only going outside. But how” 

Yeah. We don't know how to exit the house. It’s been 1.5 hours since we were opening doors.

“Okay. Try more”

…….

3 hours passed. It’s been 4.5 hours since we kept on opening doors. My legs were in pain. I was thirsty. We left everything in the car. 

“I don’t know how to exit this house. We need to find out. But how? “

“Why does this house have a lot of rooms with a lot of doors?”, the broker said.

“I think if we are able to recollect which doors we opened right from the beginning we are able……. Wait…. Hey, that’s why the old man told me to remember things. Do you remember that? ”

“Yes man. The old moron deliberately did this”.

“Okay. I am going to call the police”

“Yeah. sounds correct”.

The police took the phone. We told him the details.

“What? You also got stuck in that house?” he asked

I didn’t get him. 

He continued “Hai souls, you got into a house that has 1,234,567,890 rooms and the house is situated in a parallel realm and the entrance door connects ours and it’s. The only way is to find the exact doors you had opened and travel back on the exact path you came and reach the main hall and thereby open the main door”.  

“Okay. But how do you know these things?”

“Because you are not the one who called like this?”

“What? Then lot of stuck here and left”

“No my dear. It’s lot of *remained* stuck there”

“Sorry. I ….”

“Let me be clear. Yes. You are not alone there. You are accompanied by at least 4 living people if there are still living and a lot of corpses. Every month’s Full Moon,a group will see a small girl or a middle aged lady or old man standing in the middle of the road and guiding them to this house”. 

We were shocked. We were jerked. 

“Okay sir. Why don’t you come here and save us?”

“No. Because the house is only visible for someone who needs a house for buying, staying for a day or for renting. I know the place but if we reach there, we only see a weeping Willow of Purple color”

“What should we do now?”

“That is the only way to come out, keeping the same path. But if you forgot, no way unless by trillions of probability or combinations or permutations, you are able to get to the main hall in the house of 1,234,567,890 rooms and a lot of doors per room. ”

“Sir, we will die here due to hunger and thirst”

“No, there are a lot of kitchens there that have a lot of raw fresh fruits and vegetables.  You can eat them. But again, you have to find them”. 

“Don’t lose hope. In the past 20 years, 5 people managed to get out of the house. “

He disconnected the call. We also disconnected from ourselves. What happened to us? How we are going to find the exit. The mobile’s battery is now draining. I put it in “battery saver” mode. After the switch off, we lost connection to the outside world. The house is very mysterious. We are able to get the mobile tower. Even able to hear what’s happening outside like distant vehicle noises, birds, wind etc. But nobody from outside is able to see the house. We are trapped inside now. 

No way out.

Now , first we need to find the kitchen. But where is it ? 

Also, where are the 4 alive people ?

What if we are trapped inside forever until we become old and die?

Friends, please provide my ways to get out or live here. My battery is 85 % for now.

NoSleep,The Lot ,"I had people ask me about the journal I found on my last journey. I had no intention of sharing its contents because it’s author was not worthy of The Lot. But seeing as no one has the courage to join me for my next voyage to the new world I shall share the writings. Maybe it will inspire someone else to seek the treasure waiting us. 

Here below is the contents of the book I obtained. 

I’ve never been much of a writer. Never been much of anything really, I lived my life one ordinary day at a time. 

I would say I was nearly an NPC. Weeks would go by without a change in my routine, I was living the life I thought I needed to. And it was a total waste, those dreams and ambitions are gone now. 

I should probably start at the beginning. Damn that sounds cliché but I’m writing in pen and I’m not going to scribble it out. You would think I would plan out what I’m going to write, but that’s just not how I do things so instead you get my ramblings. 

My name is Chuck, I’m a six foot one white guy who graduated middle of my class. I’ve been working a fairly dead end job as an online retailer for three years. 

That all changed when I found myself in this pocket dimension. At least that’s what I’m assuming it is, I have no idea as to what’s going on but alternate universe seems like as good an explanation as any. 

Like any other Tuesday or Thursday I was at the gym. When you sit for a living you have to keep moving in your off time. It was late, I had taken my sweet time showering. 

I would kill for a shower right now. 

So I walked out of the building, my mind on other things and I couldn’t seem to find my car. 

And it was dark, there wasn’t a single street light or building within sight. I reasoned that the power must be out, I kept clicking my key fob. 

My brain filled my ears with faint ringing in an attempt to comprehend the silence. Fear coursed through me, I knew something was horribly wrong. 

But when I turned to run back into the gym I found myself looking out over an endless expanse of metal humps. 

Every direction I turned showed more of the same. As animal instinct took over, I started to run. 

I ran and I ran, there was no end. It wasn’t long before I collapsed, it was both impossible and undeniable. I was no longer in Boulder. 

I screamed for help until my voice grew weak. I wandered back and forth looking for some glitch, some portal between worlds. 

The sun rose on the first day, it’s light revealing just how absolutely screwed I was. I couldn’t see an end, cars stretched on for dozens of miles. Rolling hills covered in black top and vehicles. 

The pattern was unbroken in every direction, an open lane, a car, a car and another open lane. No light poles, no flowerbeds. I almost felt dizzy, like my brain couldn’t comprehend the sheer vastness of this place. 

Despite it’s familiar appearance it felt wrong, twisted and distorted. This place wasn’t good, I wasn’t meant to be here. 

I had to shake away those thoughts on order to survive, if I focused on them I could imagine my body changing into something else. Something wrong. 

I reasoned that my best shot at escaping was to remain as close to the beginning as possible. If I had accidently entered perhaps I could accidentally exit. It was a flawed yet comforting logic. 

It only took a couple hours before I started to loot vehicles. After all, they were either not real, or the damage would lead to someone discovering me. 

I even tried to hotwire a dozen or so vehicles, but without Google I was just blindly connecting wires. Only one started but then I could steer it. So I burnt it and pissed on its corpse. 

I found myself growing accustom to the life of looting and vandalizing. There was this one time I had a chain reaction of burning cars get out of hand, but the fear made me feel alive again. 

After a week I had exhausted the resources in the area, I had to move on to fresh pastures. 

That’s when the first curve ball got me. After sleeping in a new area I remembered I had left a tool bag behind. I went to retrieve it but all the cars were in pristine condition. And they were different, my dozens of smashed and burnt cars were gone. Replaced by new vehicles
 
At the time I thought this meant infinite resources. It took a few more weeks for me to realize time moved forward. The cars didn’t spawn, not like I had thought. 

Rather than rendering as I moved forward they appeared to have already been here. But at the same time it was like things hadn’t started to age until I arrived. At first this didn’t bother me, but I soon realized this meant fresh food would soon be spoiled. 

I had found so many center consoles filled with rotten fruit but it took finding a moldy granola bar, my most common staple for me to worry about surviving. 

The fun had left once I thought about starving to death. I needed to get out. It had been over a month and nothing positive had happened. 

So I decided to push forward. I spent a long time figuring it out but I finally got an older GMC van to fire up. It took a ton of effort but I managed to break the steering lock. With all but the drivers seat removed I had plenty of room inside for supplies and sleeping. 

I barreled between the cars at a reckless speed. Quite often pushing 90mph, the little humps became ramps that would send me into the air for a brief second. 

I found myself thoroughly enjoying the drive. The near death moments just made me feel alive. That was until I clipped the back of a pickup that was poking out a little farther than expected.

The van spun with the impact and I felt myself leave the seat. Before I could react the van was flipping. At first sideways and then end over end. 

It happened so fast I didn’t have a chance to register what was happening. I found my self sitting on the asphalt bleeding from a dozen small cuts. My van lay on top of a 90’s Thunderbird it’s wheels still spinning. 

When the pain hit I knew what to do. No matter the distance traveled there was always a truck somewhere nearby that would undoubtedly have alcohol in it. 

This time was no different. It took a full case of shitty beer to numb my injuries but at last I was able sleep. 

I spent a good bit of time in that area. I hadn’t broken any bones but my entire body hurt. I took the time to carefully recover and to get in some exercise. 

The food situation was getting worse but it was not lethal yet. 

Two months into my journey I had visitors. I had strung my cobbled together hammock between two vehicles and was sleeping comfortably when something woke me. 

I lay still listening, my instincts told me I wasn’t alone. Sure enough I soon heard the slap of hard flesh on asphalt. 

Someone nearby was running barefoot. I sat up and came face to face with a grinning man. My eyes were drawn to his blackened teeth. Without warning he lunged forward. 

The hammock spun under our combined weight sending him over me. I had barely gotten my feet under me when he turned. His face now bloodied from its impact with the ground. 

He moved to grapple me but met my fist instead. I gasped in pain, I had never punched someone without gloves and head gear before. I should have held back a little. 

The blow knocked the crazed man onto the ground again. He was spitting blood and growling in an uncivilized manner. Rather than let him gain his footing I kicked the back of his head. 

And then I repeated that action until he lay still. 

Breathing heavily I leaned against the nearest car. I looked around me, my blood ran cold. 

There had to have been half a dozen people watching me. They were dirty, scarred and mostly nude. But most of all, they were hungry. 

I could see it in their eyes. I was nothing more than a Christmas ham to them. 

With their intent clear I slowly reached down, I managed to get my hand into my tool bag before the first pair sprinted towards me. 

They were so quiet, the only sound they made was slapping of feet and the grinding of teeth. 

My hand wrapped around the smooth handle of my 2.5 pound hammer. Taking a risk I grasped it firmly and pulled it from the bag. In a single movement I threw it at the nearest attacker. 

My throw was good, the hammer nearly disappeared into the man’s forehead and he dropped instantly. Before I could grab the next tool the second man was on me. 

I grabbed him and using his own momentum I tossed him over my hip into a nearby car. He struck it hard leaving a dent in the door. 

But unlike his companion he was back on his feet in a flash. I managed to drop an elbow through his collar bone as he grappled me. With his left arm limp it was easy break free. I kick to the chest sent him tumbling over a car. 

That was enough for him, he turned and ran into the night. 

I spun around in case the others had decided to attack but I was once again alone. Save for the two bodies that lay motionless. 

I grabbed my tool bag, retrieved my hammer and walked away. 

That attack changed things, I traveled by night more often. At least when I had flashlights to see with. Those people returned a few more times, each time I was able to fend them off with my homemade weapons. 

My walking stick now had a blade secured to the top. I also fashioned a short club and carried a knife in my belt. The weapons didn’t add much weight and were very effective on human flesh. 

But my attackers grew more cunning. I noticed a change after a week, they went from barely human savages to more stealthy people with some clothing. 

They died just as easily when their skulls were crushed but they didn’t blindly attack. Rather they ambushed, fought in groups and played tricks.  

One such trick nearly snaring me.

I was traveling during the day as I had exhausted my last flashlight. As the sun drew low I found myself settling for the bed of a pickup. It had grown cold but I still preferred sleeping outside. 

My eyes had just closed when something wet slapped against my face. Leaping to my feet with a club in one hand a knife in the other I looked around. I couldn’t see anyone in the dark. 

Something moist struck my back before falling into the bed of the truck with a plop. 

Seeing no one I reached down and retrieved the object. It was a bloody chunk of meat. No doubt I was covered in the thick pungent  juices. 

Then I saw it, a man stood to lob another chunk of flesh at me. I jumped from the truck, the man turned and fled. 

It did him no good, I had grown lean and hard during my time in this hell hole. No matter how desperately he weaved I gained on him. 

Once I had closed the gap I struck him between the shoulder blades. He fell to the ground and slid head first into a car. His body stopping with a crunch. 

They had ruined my clothes, I was irate. I screamed into the night. I felt hungry, yet I knew food wouldn’t satiate me. I hunted every flash of movement. I bashed, slashed and dismembered every one I came across. 

The rising sun found me out of breath and sporting a dozen cuts and bite marks. 

But never in all my life had I felt so alive. I was the ultimate predator, they had seen me as weak and vulnerable and it had cost them their lives. 

Unfortunately my success did not fix the problem of being absolutely filthy. If it wasn’t for cold temperatures I would have continued my journey nude.

Had I known why they had attacked me in the manner that they did I would have stripped despite the weather. 

I made it to mid day before my aggressors plan came to fruition. 

My guard was down, never had anyone come for me in the daylight. As I passed a tall truck the hairy head of a Doberman lunged out and sank its teeth into my calf. 

I cried out in pain, the dog twisted back and forth keeping me from regaining my bearings. Two more mutts came from opposite directions. 

The first to arrive received a knife in its face. It left quickly howling in agony. I barely had time to lift my arm as the second lashed out. It bit into my arm, the pain was excruciating but preferred to a neck wound. 

I was being pulled in two directions, each beast intent on getting its pound of flesh. 

I drove my thumb into the eye of the dog holding my arm. It cried out just enough for me to pull myself free, all the while the one using my leg as a chew toy pulled me further under the truck. 

My hand brushed the handle of my club, I gripped it tightly. Ignoring the ripping sensation in my leg I rolled over and brought the club down onto the skull of the dog that had attacked my arm. 

It crumpled to the ground and lay there twitching. 

Grabbing the step of the truck I pulled with such force the dog lost its grip on my leg. I managed to pull myself out from under the truck. 

The dog was quick to pursue, I swung my club but it struck the truck first and delivered only a glancing blow to the dog. In turn the dog managed to bite into the elbow of my good arm. 

My club fell to the ground as my arm spasmed. But I was not ready to die, not yet. 

I rolled onto the back of the dog, my arm pulling its head sideways as I did. The dumb beast wouldn’t let go and that gave me my opening. I sank my teeth into the dog’s throat. I pushed past the hair and bit through the tough skin. 

With a jerk of my neck I pulled a large piece of flesh free, hot sticky blood sprayed across my body. 

The dog released me and tried to run, a few yards away it collapsed and convulsed violently before laying still. 

I was bleeding badly from my leg, my arms were badly torn as well but the river of red coming from my leg was my greater concern. 

I took off my belt and using my club I made a tourniquet. The tightening of the tourniquet was the single most painful thing I had ever experienced. 

When the blood stopped flowing I fell to the ground. I feel no shame in saying I cried for a bit. 

But I didn’t have the time to lay there. I could hear growls of more canines approaching. 

Somehow I managed to get to my feet. I then climbed onto a van. I lay on the roof feeling weaker than I thought possible. 

Claws scratched on metal, I sat just in time to see a massive half starved Rottweiler leap from the hood of the van onto the roof. 

I kicked it off the roof. When I looked over the edge I saw at least a dozen dogs of various breeds all meandering about. They looked up at me drooling and whining. 

To them I was nothing more than a T bone steak. My weapons were mostly depleted, my strength fading. Even the sunlight was leaving me. 

To my surprise the lower the sun got the less dogs I saw. They milled about nervously, a few tried to get me only to be booted back. 

As the last rays of sunlight disappeared so did the dogs. But I was far from relieved. I doubted the dogs feared the wildmen. And they certainly didn’t fear me. 

What was coming with the darkness that would cause them to leave a meal?  

I didn’t stay long enough to find out. I slid off the van and hobbled as best I could. 

Perhaps an hour into my journey I heard the screeching of metal being ripped apart. I don’t know what had the strength to do such a thing but I do know I was in no condition to meet it. 

I made little progress that night, I count myself lucky nothing came out of the dark to attack me. I would have succumbed easily to anything. 

I can’t feel my leg, the vagueness is almost worse than the pain. My attempt at making crutches failed. I need something though, I won’t survive without mobility. 

Salvation comes in the form of a bike rack with a blue bike likely made for a middle school student hanging from it. 

Bikes are exceedingly rare, this is the second that I’ve seen in my trip through The Lot. 

Some time has passed, perhaps a week or more. Things got dire and a decision had to be made. 

My leg is gone. Cutting it off was easier than expected, sawing through the bone was time consuming but once achieved I was able to cauterize the stump. 

I fell into a state of depression after the loss of my limb. The very next night the wildmen came, they took my supplies but remained out of reach. 

I think they know I can’t pursue them any longer, but they still fear the consequences of getting within my reach. 

Progress is incredibly slow, I find that I am starving, I’m freezing, I might die here. 

The reality of that never struck me quite so hard, I don’t think I have the strength to go for much longer. 

I find that I’m ok with this, my life was that of someone going through the motions. I did what was expected and each day was like the last. But since coming here, since experiencing true freedom haltered only by my own limitations I finally felt alive. I felt like I was my own person. 

I made it farther than I thought I would have, I have been reduced to pulling myself along. Despite laying on frozen ground I do not feel cold. 

I know I have a fever, I know I am living my last couple days. I have no one to say goodbye to, and that’s ok. I’m ok with this. 

I seem to have found the end of the cars, there are more empty spaces than full. It is because of this that I spotted the shambler.

He has been ever so slowly following behind me, his pace only slightly faster than my own. 

I do not know if he is another lost soul like myself or a very persistent wildman. Perhaps he is something different all together, regardless of if he is my salvation, my doom or simply another human to sit beside as I die, he will reach me within the day. 

Consider this my last entry, unless I am carried from this world I will not leave it. I have positioned myself under a vehicle in order to shelter from the snow. I now wait for the stranger to come, I wait to discover my fate.

NoSleep,I went cave exploring with some friends. I'm the only one that survived.,"I used to think Mammoth Cave was just another adventure, a tick off our list. It was supposed to be fun, a weekend to explore the shadows with my best friends, to test our nerves in the endless dark. But somewhere down there, under miles of stone, something went wrong. Now, one of us is missing, and I swear… I can still hear him calling.

We’d been going for hours, our voices echoing through the tunnels, each one mocking the confidence we had when we started. There was me, Sam, and my friends Luke, Jared, and Ben. Ben was always the daring one, the first to wander ahead, the one who’d get us into trouble just to laugh it off. But when he didn’t come back, no one was laughing.

It’s strange. We retraced our steps, searched every crevice, calling his name until our voices scraped raw. Nothing. Just an endless silence, heavy and swallowing. And then… the faintest echo, like Ben’s voice, drifting from somewhere deep in the shadows.

Luke was the first to hear him calling. He stopped dead, his hand shooting up as we walked, telling us to listen. We froze, straining against the thick silence.

“Did you hear that?” he whispered, his voice barely louder than a breath. None of us had, but as we stood there, letting the silence settle around us, we heard it—a faint, distant call, almost swallowed by the stone around us.

It was Ben’s voice, unmistakably. He was calling out, the sound barely reaching us but bouncing off the cave walls in strange, warped echoes. The direction was wrong, though. The call wasn’t coming from where we’d last seen him—it was coming from one of the tunnels we hadn’t even traveled down. But maybe, somehow, the paths were connected. It wasn’t impossible for cave tunnels to intersect.

We were probably about two miles down at this point, so deep that the silence felt alive, closing in around us. The chill in the air seeped into our bones, and every breath echoed back like a reminder of how far we’d come. The walls felt tighter here, the space around us shrinking with each step.

Our lights cast shaky beams on the rough stone, cutting through just enough darkness to keep us moving. We’d packed extra batteries, sure, but even with the supplies, an uneasy feeling twisted in my gut. Still, leaving wasn’t an option. Ben was down there somewhere, and we couldn’t just abandon him in the dark.

We walked down a few hundred feet, calling out Ben’s name into the dark, then waiting in silence, hoping for any kind of response. The cave swallowed our voices, leaving only the faint drip of water somewhere far off. Then, after what felt like ages, we heard him.

It came from behind us.

“What the fuck?” Luke whispered, his voice tight and shaky, eyes darting back toward the path we’d just covered.

Jared, louder than any of us, shouted back, “Alright, Ben, you can stop messing with us now, man! This isn’t funny, bro!”

I wanted to believe it—that Ben was just messing with us, hiding in some shadowed nook and waiting to jump out. But as I stared into the empty tunnel behind us, a chill crept over me. I couldn’t shake the feeling that somehow… it wasn’t really Ben.

We backtracked, our lights slicing through the shadows as we searched every inch of the area. We moved slowly, scouring every nook, every crack in the walls, but there wasn’t a single trace of Ben. Not a footprint, not even a scuff mark. He was just… gone.

Eventually, we returned to the central cavern, slumping down on the cold stone to catch our breath and regroup. I told the others what had been gnawing at me, the dread curling around my thoughts. But Luke was quick to brush it off.

“Oh, come on, man, you know Ben is just fucking with us,” he said, his tone forced, like he was trying to convince himself as much as me.

“Well, how did he end up back here, then, when he was down there before?” I shot back. “I’m telling you guys, something isn’t right.”

Before anyone could answer, Ben’s voice echoed again, faint but unmistakable. This time, it came from the tunnel we’d seen him go down first.

“C’mon, guys… this way,” his voice drifted down the rocky corridors, a lazy drawl that somehow felt… wrong.

Jared sprang to his feet, shouting down the tunnel, “Screw you, Ben! When I see you, I’m gonna beat the shit out of you!”

Then, we heard it—a low, chuckling laugh, the sound echoing, but from a completely different tunnel. Luke and Jared exchanged glances, the bravado draining from their faces. It was like the air had thickened, and now they felt it too. Something was off.

A chill crept over all of us, settling in our bones as Ben’s laughter faded into the shadows. We huddled together, whispering hurriedly about what to do. The idea of leaving came up quick, but Luke shut it down fast.

“We can’t just leave Ben down here, guys,” he insisted, voice firm but edged with unease.

Jared shook his head, glancing toward the distant exit. “I’m going. I’ll call the cops and tell them our friend’s missing. I’ll come back with a search party.”

It wasn’t a bad idea, honestly. Part of me felt relief at the thought of professionals with equipment and experience. But Luke wouldn’t budge, his jaw set, determination in his eyes. He wanted to keep looking, convinced that Ben was close, just around the next corner.

Jared didn’t wait for more argument. With a last look back, he took off down the path toward the exit, his flashlight bouncing along the walls until he was out of sight.

Luke and I stood there in silence, the weight of the decision hanging heavy between us. Eventually, we decided to search a little longer. Just a little longer, we told ourselves.

After Jared disappeared from sight, Luke and I ventured down the same tunnel Ben had vanished into. We called out, voices barely steady, and after a moment, Ben’s voice drifted back, faint and distorted, like it was caught in a slow echo. The sound seeped out of a dark, narrow crevice ahead, just wide enough for us to squeeze through.

We moved cautiously, each step slower than the last, feeling a prickling sensation on our necks, like unseen eyes were watching us from the shadows. The path bent sharply to the right, creating the illusion that it might loop back toward one of the other tunnels. Luke forced a chuckle. “See? He’s just messing with us…”

But as we rounded the corner, our lights caught something that made us stop dead. A jagged hole yawned open in the middle of the path, wide and deep, cutting off the tunnel. The space was too narrow to walk side by side, so I trailed behind Luke as he edged forward and aimed his flashlight down into the darkness below.

Luke went silent, his light fixed on something I couldn’t see. I waited, the quiet pressing in, until the tension grew unbearable. “What is it?” I whispered, trying to peer around him.

When he turned to me, his face was drained of color, eyes wide, lips parted like he couldn’t quite find the words. He swallowed, barely managing to get it out.

“He’s down there,” Luke said, his voice trembling.

My blood ran cold. “What do you mean?” I stammered, heart pounding against my ribs.

“He’s down there, Sam,” Luke whispered, voice cracking. “Dead…”

The words hit me like a punch. I stood there, numb with disbelief, until Luke grabbed my arm, his grip almost painful. “We have to get out of here,” he said, voice tight with terror.

Without another word, we turned and started back, moving fast but steady, our lights casting frantic beams along the rough stone walls. As we reached the tunnel that led back to the central cavern, another voice echoed through the darkness.

“Guys…”

Neither of us paused. We broke into a sprint, feet pounding against the ground, breaths ragged with panic. We didn’t care where it was coming from; we just wanted out.

In his haste, Luke stumbled over a jagged rock and fell hard, his flashlight skidding across the ground before shattering into pieces. I stopped, reaching down to pull him up, my light sweeping the walls as I moved. And that’s when I saw it—a figure, pale and naked, crouched at the far end of the tunnel, watching us with hollow, empty eyes. It looked almost human… but something was horribly, horribly wrong.

“Oh my god…” I muttered, my voice barely a whisper, trembling as I stared at the figure. Luke turned, catching sight of it, his face twisting in terror. He grabbed my arm, jolting me out of my daze.

“C’mon, Sam…” he urged, pulling me forward.

We didn’t look back, rushing through the darkness, desperate to put as much distance as possible between us and whatever that thing was. Every shadow felt like it was closing in on us, every echo stretching our nerves tighter.

As we reached the main tunnel that led out of the cave, we saw a figure lying on the ground ahead. Jared. He was sprawled face-down, motionless, his flashlight lying a few feet away, casting an eerie glow on the stone.

“Oh god…” I breathed, heart racing as we knelt beside him. He must’ve tripped, maybe knocked himself out in his rush to get out. But when we turned him over, the breath left my lungs.

His face was unrecognizable, crushed and bloody, as if something had beaten him down, over and over. The horror of it froze us in place, and I could barely think, only feel the cold grip of fear sinking deeper into my bones.

That’s when we heard it—a voice drifting from the shadows, but this time, it wasn’t Ben’s. It was Jared’s.

“C’mon, guys… this way…” the voice called, soft and taunting.

I swung my flashlight toward the sound, heart hammering, and there it was, standing just beyond the light’s reach. Pale, humanoid, but wrong in every way. Its skin was chalky, almost luminescent under the beam, and its eyes… solid black, empty and endless.

The thing stared at us for a moment, then turned, its movements jerky and unnatural, and ran down the tunnel, laughing in Jared’s voice, a sick, twisted echo of the friend we’d known.

“What the hell…” Luke whispered, voice barely audible over my own pounding heart. He grabbed my arm, his grip trembling. “We have to get out of here, man!”

I didn’t need any convincing. We bolted, feet slamming against the stone, the darkness stretching ahead of us like a maw, ready to swallow us whole.

As we ran, the creature’s footsteps echoed close behind, its pace relentless. My heart pounded, my breaths coming in ragged gasps as we pushed forward. Suddenly, Luke stumbled and fell, hitting the ground hard.

I skidded to a stop, spinning around, and that’s when I saw it—the creature had caught up to him, gripping his leg and starting to drag him back into the shadows. Luke clawed at the ground, his face contorted in terror.

Without thinking, I shone my flashlight directly on it, and as the beam hit, the creature shrank back, raising its long, bony arms to shield its huge black eyes. It couldn’t stand the light; that much was clear.

I stepped toward Luke, light fixed on the creature as it hissed and retreated, slipping back into the pitch-black depths of the cave. We backed away slowly, both of us trembling, the silence around us settling like a heavy weight.

We kept moving, trying to keep our steps steady, though every nerve in our bodies screamed to run. Luke fumbled in his bag, pulling out his spare flashlight, and now with both beams cutting through the shadows, we scanned every crevice, every dark corner around us.

The creature was silent now, but its presence clung to us, a feeling so thick it was hard to breathe. We both knew it was still near, lurking just out of sight, watching and waiting.

Minutes stretched on, each one more suffocating than the last. But then, just as panic threatened to take over, we saw it—the cave entrance, a sliver of remaining daylight spilling in, piercing through the darkness like a lifeline. It was so close, a beacon of hope after the nightmare that had nearly swallowed us whole.

We made it… or at least, we thought we did. Step by step, we edged closer to the exit, the sunlight drawing us in, so close I could almost feel its warmth.

But just as we reached the final stretch, the creature dropped down from above, a blur of pale skin and black eyes, crashing into Luke and sending him sprawling to the ground. I whipped around, frantically aiming my light, but it was too late. In an instant, the creature pinned him down, smashing his head against the stone with brutal force.

Paralyzed for a split second, my mind screamed at me to act, to do something. But instinct took over. I turned and ran, abandoning Luke’s final, muffled cries, leaving my friend behind. Tears streamed down my face, blurring my vision as I pushed myself forward, barely seeing the light ahead.

When I finally burst out of the cave into the fading daylight, I collapsed to the ground, gasping for air, chest heaving, and the weight of loss crashing over me. The tears came hard, unstoppable, as I lay there, shattered, knowing I was the only one who’d made it out.

As I forced myself to stand, steadying my breath, I heard it—Luke’s voice, faint and choked with fear, calling out from the depths of the cave.

“Sam… please… help me…”

I froze, every instinct screaming at me to ignore it, to remember what I’d seen, to remember that Luke was gone. But hearing his voice, broken and desperate, twisted my insides. The guilt clawed at me, sharper than any fear. I had left him. I had abandoned him.

The pleading continued, soft but relentless, each word pulling at the frayed edges of my sanity. Some part of me wanted to turn back, to run into the dark, convinced he was waiting, that I could still save him.

But another part, a colder, darker part, knew the truth. It wasn’t Luke. It was the creature, mimicking his voice, sinking its claws into the last threads of hope I had left. And yet… what if, somehow, it really was him? The thought tore at me, leaving me stranded there, helpless and shattered, unable to move forward or look back.

Finally, I forced myself to turn away from the cave, each step heavier than the last. I had to leave. I had to get out and tell someone what had happened, no matter how impossible it all seemed.

But as I reached the edge of the forest, the realization settled in—I couldn’t tell them the truth. They’d never believe me. No one would. I could already picture the looks of doubt, the whispers, the judgment.

So I rehearsed the lie as I stumbled into town, every word twisting in my throat. I told them we were stalked by someone in the cave. That he’d ambushed us, attacked Jared and Luke. I described a faceless killer lurking in the dark, hunting us down one by one. It was easier that way, easier than trying to explain the unexplainable.

They listened, and they wrote it all down, but even as I spoke, a chill ran through me. In the back of my mind, Luke’s voice still echoed, pleading, calling me back into the dark.

The cops didn’t let it go. They pressed me for hours, asking the same questions over and over, watching my every reaction. Soon enough, they began talking to my friends and family, probing into my relationship with the group. I could see it in their eyes—they suspected me. I was the last one out, the only one who’d made it back, and my story didn’t add up.

They searched the cave for days, combing through every passage, every cavern. Eventually, they found Ben’s body, crumpled at the bottom of that pit, limbs twisted at unnatural angles. But Luke and Jared… they were gone. Their remains were never recovered.

And now, when I close my eyes, I still see the darkness of that cave, hear the echo of their voices, distant and pleading. No one believes me. And maybe, after all this, I’m not sure I even believe myself.

The only thing I know for certain is that I’ll never step foot in another cave for as long as I live. The thought alone makes my skin crawl, my heart race. The darkness isn’t just unsettling to me now; it’s a living, breathing terror, wrapping itself around every corner, every shadow.

I’m afraid of the dark in ways I never imagined, paranoia gnawing at me every time I turn off a light. Even here, in my own home, I can feel it—the creature’s gaze, lurking just beyond the glow of my lamp, hidden in the pockets of darkness, patient and unyielding.

It’s waiting for me. I can feel it, lurking, watching, waiting for that one moment when I’m left alone in the dark. And I know, deep down, that it won’t stop until it pulls me back into the shadows… just like it did with [them.](https://youtu.be/_qyZins7xMg?si=ALanckwKPPwwIe6b)",717,0.98,38,InformationRemote865,2024-11-07 20:11:58,1gm7rvu,755,High
NoSleep,We Moved Into Our New Home and Things Were Not Okay ,"I don’t remember hearing it right away. I think, at first, I convinced myself it was nothing more than the natural sounds of an old house.

 Houses make noise, that a given—creaks, groans, the wind lashing against the windows, the floorboards  
settling. That’s what I told myself when I first heard the dripping. 

But now, standing here in the basement, the sound dominated my senses. The steady drip of water hitting a  
surface filled my head, growing louder with each passing moment.

I’ve followed it, searched for it, but no matter where I went, it remained just out of reach.

My eyes scan the aged stone walls of the basement, meticulously searching for the elusive source of the  
disturbance.

But it wasn’t always like this. There was a time when this place felt like home—quaint and charming, a bit  
rough around the edges sure, but full of potential.

Sarah and I had fallen in love with the house at first sight.

The realtor had given us a brief tour, and when we reached the basement, he quickly brushed past it,  
barely mentioning the fact that it existed at all.

It seemed odd at the time, but we didn’t think much of it. Old basements are creepy; everyone knows that. 

Now I wish we had listened to our instincts. And I wish we had never set foot down here.

The dripping had started about two weeks after we had moved in. I remember Sarah complaining about it while we were eating breakfast one morning. 

""Adam, do you hear that?"" she’d asked, her brow furrowed the way it always does when she’s  
frustrated. ""It’s driving me insane."" 

I hadn’t noticed it until she pointed it out. And that’s when I heard it for the first time.

A faint, rhythmic drip was coming from somewhere beneath us. I dismissed it—probably a leaky pipe, I  
thought. It’s an old house; these things happen, I reasoned.

That very night however, the sound, it seemed to get louder. As I lay in bed, staring up at the ceiling, I  
could hear it clearly this time.

 drip… drip… drip… drip

It sounded close, too close.

I tried to block it out, but the more I focused on it, the louder it became.

Sarah turned over next to me, restless, and I knew she was hearing it too. I could sense the tension in the  
air as she was trying her very best to ignore and sleep through it.

""Can you check it out tomorrow?"" she finally whispered to me, her voice barely audible over the  
steady drip. 

""Yeah, I’ll look into it,"" I replied, though I was already dreading the idea of going down into  
the basement. Something about it felt off—like a cold weight settling over my  
chest.

The next day, I made my way down the narrow stairs to the basement.

Boxes were still piled up against the walls, remnants from the move we hadn’t bothered to unpack yet. The  
air smelled musty, like old earth and damp concrete. 

The dripping echoed all around me, but I couldn’t pinpoint its source.

The pipes along the ceiling looked fine—no signs of leaks or condensation. I checked the corners, the  
floor, the walls. 

Nothing.

I even crouched down near the floor drains, but they were bone dry. The sound seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. 

Frustrated, I climbed back upstairs and told Sarah I couldn’t find anything. She looked disappointed.  
She somehow hoped I would come up with some sort of magic fix. 

""You didn’t look hard enough,"" she said, her eyes dark with concern. ""That sound is getting  
louder.""

And she wasn’t wrong.

Over the next few days, the dripping grew more insistent. It followed us from room to room, a constant,  
maddening noise we couldn’t escape.

In a peculiar way, the dripping reminded me of those Chinese torture experiments I’d heard about on TV as a kid—where a person is secured in a fixed position, and water slowly drips onto the same spot on their forehead. Over time, the rhythmic dripping becomes psychologically distressing and physically uncomfortable, leading to anxiety, irritation, and even psychological breakdown, though this felt like a milder version.

And it wasn’t just the sound. The smell started shortly after—faint at first, like damp wood, but soon it became overpowering, rancid.

It clung to everything, seeping into the walls, the floors, our clothes. It chased us around like a shadow. The  
whole thing was driving Sarah mad with rage.

I finally called a plumber, thinking it had to be a hidden leak, maybe a burst pipe we couldn’t see. 

But something strange thing happened when the plumber arrived at our doorstep.

 The dripping, it stopped the moment he set foot in the house.

He came, checked the entire house top to bottom, and found nothing. Not a single drop of water where it wasn’t supposed to be. 

The rancid smell we had grown accustomed to, seemed to vanish in his presence too. 

As we watched him go through every room, running his checks, we could hardly believe our senses. Sarah and I looked at each other perplexed.

""I don’t know what to tell you,"" he said finally, scratching his head. ""Everything looks fine to  
me. Are you sure it’s not just in your head?""

I wish it had been in our heads.

That night, the smell grew worse. Sarah was coughing, gagging from the stench, and I wasn’t doing much  
better.

We couldn’t sleep, not with  
that goddamn dripping and the rotten odor.

Desperate, I grabbed a flashlight and headed back down to the basement in the middle of the night,  
determined to find the source. 

This time, I noticed something I hadn’t seen before.

In the farthest corner, behind a stack of old furniture the previous owners had left behind, there was something odd—a patch of the wall that looked different. The wood was older, splintering, almost as if it didn’t belong to  
the rest of the foundation. That’s when I realized it was a fake wall. The dripping sound seemed to be coming from behind it.

I cleared away the furniture, my heart pounding. As I removed the last piece, I saw it—behind the wall was a sealed well, hidden away, as if someone had wanted it forgotten.

It was small, barely large enough to fit a person, with a rusted metal cover and bricks haphazardly piled around it as if someone had tried to seal it off quickly.

My stomach turned as the rancid smell hit me full force. I gagged, pulling my shirt over my nose, but I  
couldn’t tear my eyes away. 

The dripping had stopped.

I called Sarah down to see it for herself, and her reaction was much like mine—horror and disgust. We debated  
what to do, but the smell had become unbearable. We needed to open the well,  
air it out, get rid of whatever was causing the stench. 

The moment I pried the cover off, a wave of cold air rushed out, thick and stale, like something had been  
trapped down there for decades.

I peered inside, shining the flashlight into the well, but there was no water. It was dry—bone dry. 

That’s when I saw it.

Wet, slick footprints trailed up the stone walls from the bottom of the well. My heart skipped a beat. There  
were only footprints and nothing else.

""What the hell is this?"" Sarah whispered, her voice trembling.

""I don’t know,"" I replied, stepping back, my legs weak. ""We need to seal it.""

We hastily put the cover back on, but it was too late. The damage was done.

That night, the dripping returned—louder, more insistent. And this time it was followed by footprints as  
well.

At first, they were subtle—small, damp marks near the basement stairs, as if someone had walked  
through water.

But as the days passed, the footprints grew more frequent, larger, appearing where they shouldn’t: on the  
walls, the ceiling, even in our bedroom. They materialized without warning and  
slowly faded away, leaving us frozen in terror.

It felt like something invisible was living in our midst, casually keeping an eye on us at will.

I suggested to Sarah that maybe we should leave, but she refused. We had sunk all our life savings into this  
place. Walking away was unthinkable.

""This is our home, Adam,"" she said, her voice firm. ""We can figure this out. Give it a  
few more days. We’ll get to the bottom of it.""

I wanted to believe her. I wanted to think we could fix whatever was wrong. But all I could hear was  
drip... drip... drip.

But what truly made me paranoid were the whispers.

It started during dinner. At first, faint—barely audible, like an echo.

 But soon, they grew louder, more distinct, as though voices were calling out from the depths of my  
mind. 

*""Adam... whhhhherrree  arre  youuuuuuu..?,""* a raspy voice echoed in my head.

*“Come down the stairs….. to the basement,”*

*“Open the lid and set me free Adam.”*

*“I am waiting…..”*

I tried to brush it off, telling myself it was just stress. 

But then I saw Sarah’s face go pale, her eyes darting away as panic consumed her. I knew at that instant that she heard it too.

Finally, I put my foot down and told her we were moving out. If it meant spending a few nights in a cheap  
motel, so be it—we were leaving first thing in the morning. I didn’t care about the money anymore; I was ready to sell the place or even tear the house down to the ground if that’s what it took.

To my surprise, she didn’t fight me this time.

As I watched her lay down for bed that night, relief washed over me, and I fell into a fitful sleep.

But when I woke up in the middle of the night, she was gone. She wasn’t in the bathroom either. My heart  
raced as I passed the kitchen and saw the basement door standing ajar.

I descended the stairs, breathless, and found Sarah standing near the well.

She had already removed the lid and stood motionless, as if in a trance. 

Moonlight from a nearby window illuminated the well’s mouth, casting an eerie glow over its edges.

""Sarah?"" I whispered, my throat dry as I crept closer.

She didn’t respond. Her eyes were glazed, her face ashen white, and staring into the abyss.

 And then I saw it—a pale, gaunt figure slowly lifting its head over the edge of the well, its eyes  
glinting in the moonlight. Its mottled skin stretched tight over its bones, giving it an unsettling almost ghostly appearance.

Strands of dark, matted hair clung to its scalp, casting shadows over its hollow features. It extended a  
bony hand toward Sarah, palm outstretched, silently beckoning her.

At that moment, everything started to unfold in slow motion as I watched Sarah extend her hand and move towards the creature. 

I screamed running and yanked Sarah back. We collapsed to the floor as she fell into my arms, suddenly  
breaking free from the trance. She hugged me tightly, relief evident on her face. 

 But deep down, I knew she had already made contact with the creature.

Because the dripping suddenly stopped. The smells disappeared. The whispers fell silent. And the house became completely still.

There was pin drop silence all around.

And the creature had simply vanished.

After that night, I left the house immediately. It’s been five years since the incident, and we eventually moved to a small house in the suburbs, but life has never been the same. I took Sarah to every doctor, and they ran all kinds of tests. Each one gave her a clean bill of health, insisting that there was nothing wrong with her.

But Sarah …..she never heard another sound again.

NoSleep,Eyes in the forest (Part 1),"

This happened about a month ago now but I can’t stop thinking about it. I figured writing it down here could help clear my head. And maybe someone out there who reads this has answers.



For context, I live in a pretty rural area. The nearest house to mine is just short of a mile out and my house is pretty much surrounded by forest. The driveway leading up to the house is long, it's a decent drive through forest until you reach the house. Once you pull in you see our little front porch and garage. It's a nice house, little small but it's got an upstairs, two bedrooms, decently sized living room, and is perfect for me and my wife. 



We have lived here for about a year now and everything has been going great. We moved all the way out here to get away from all the family drama that's been going on. I won't get into that here. But I like to hunt, go on walks in the woods, and am generally an outdoorsy person, it's calming for me. The forest helps me clear my head, the ambient sounds of birds chirping, the leaves crunching under my feet. Many would describe the forest as silent, but trust me you will know when it's silent. There's always noises in the forest. It may seem quiet compared to the city life you're used to. Cars honking, AC blowing, fluorescent lights humming, your coworker debating with your boss about getting that raise that you were supposed to get months ago; but the forest is just as loud, but in a calming way. But when the forest falls silent, it’s time to leave. Silence signals danger; it means something is watching.

My wife is the opposite, the woods frighten her, she typically doesn't go past the wooden fence that encloses the area around the back porch. The last time she did, about two weeks ago she fell and sprained her ankle. She can’t walk while it heals so she just uses crutches for now. She tells me the forest makes her paranoid, like there is a constant danger of being attacked. She says she feels like something is watching her in the forest. I’ve always believed I knew better, that I was at the top of the food chain in the forest. The forest should fear me and my rifle; I had no reason to fear it. But, oh, how wrong I was.



This particular night was as usual, it's hunting season and I go out with my bow just as the sun starts to set. I hike about a mile into the forest to my steel post perched high in the treetops. 

When I bow hunt I typically sit in the tree with my night vision scope on my bow and scan the area for any IR readings. I wait for the sound of a deer, and once I spot it I shoot. One arrow usually doesn't do the trick, I then have to track the deer through the dark forest and then collect my winnings. 

Why do I do this at night you might ask. 

Well my father taught me that it was the best time to hunt, but in all honesty I think I just liked the thrill, the challenge, but not after tonight. 



I also enjoy my time in the post. The forest is so quiet at night, the soft breeze gently swaying the branches back and forth, the occasional owl calling into the night. It's really relaxing when you're calm, but some days every rustling of the leaves can put you on edge. 



This was one of those days. I would hear a sound, jolt up fumbling my bow in my hands and scanning the area with my IR, nothing.

This happened repeatedly until I almost made the hike back. But then I saw it, movement in the forest, pretty far in the distance, but I was certain I had saw a figure moving slowly. I was excited to hunt my first deer of the year, I felt as if I could already taste the venison, almost as if I could already smell its corpse…

As I look through my IR to line up the shot, nothing, no glow to show me there is a biological creature in front of me. But I swear—  I look down from my scope and still see the figure moving, why isn’t it showing up on my IR? I look back at my scope, nothing, I look back into the forest, nothing. 

The creature was gone, leaving me confused and frustrated that I’d let what might have been my only deer escape.

In case you're wondering, my scope highlights all living creatures in a green glow, that's how I know where to shoot in the dark. But at this moment I am convinced mine is broken, which sucks cause these things are expensive. But that can't be—I know my sensor is working. I’d spotted a few birds through the scope and could see them clearly.

 I shrugged it off, though deep down, I think I knew something was wrong with whatever I saw in the forest.

I prepared to leave, I began to put my stuff in my bag when this stench hit me. This gut wrenching scent. It smelt like a rat had died in the air vents of an office building and everyone was now breathing dead rodent, and now you know you're not getting that raise because it was your job to lay the mouse traps.  It smelt like death. 



This scent convinced me to speed up in my endeavor to get back home to my wife.

But then something made me freeze. “Ryan, can you come down from there?”



It was my wife. 



What?



 Why is she out here? How did she get out here?

I couldn't tell what direction her voice was coming from so I grabbed my bow and scanned the area through my scope. 



No glow.



I see nothing in the scope, no glow, no creature, no wife. 

But I heard her I swear. 

  


I call out to her. 



No answer.



I chuckled to myself. “Obviously she isn’t out here, what was I expecting to see?” As these thoughts ran through my brain that foul rotten stench got stronger. 

“I better get out of here.” I thought. 



I slowly climbed out of my post, listening intently for any sound that wasn’t made by me. 

My hands clung on to each rung tightly as I lowered myself, one rung at a time. I didn’t realize how high in the treetops my post really was until this moment. 

A sound in the forest. 

I froze. 

After a long moment of silence I resumed, one rung at a time. 

Once I had reached the bottom I dug intently through my bag in search of my compass. 

After about 30 seconds of quietly fumbling through the darkness I retrieved my compass and held it no less than two inches from my face in an attempt to find which way is home. 



Once I had regained my sense of direction I started my quiet hunt through the forest. Though I kept telling myself what I had seen and heard in the forest was just a work of my imagination I refrained from turning on my flashlight in fear of alerting it to my location. 

This didn’t help me find the way back home however. I felt as if I had been walking in circles for hours when I finally saw it.

There she was. My wife. 

“Thank god.” was my first thought. I finally made it back home. Well atleast I was close. She must have noticed I had been gone for much longer than intended and came out here to call for me.



I started approaching her. 

“You shouldn't be out here.” I warned although I was grateful she was. “ It's dangerous at night, and—” 



How could I have been so blind, how could I have been so stupid. 



Where are her crutches? How the *hell* did she walk out here? 



I stood there frozen mid stride, staring into her eyes. It was– so wrong. It looked like all the joy, and happiness, everything that made her human was gone. And she just stood there, staring back. And her facial expression— god her facial expression. It looked like she had no idea how to utilize any of the muscles in her face and so they fell limp. 



This was not my wife. 



This was not human.

And then. 

It started speaking.

“*What's wrong Ryan?*” Its mouth movements not matching the words it was saying. 

“*Come home with me*.”

My wifes voice coming out of that *thing* was enough to snap me out of my trance. 

I turned and ran, faster than I had ever run before. And didn’t look back, not even for a second. It was like my brain was on autopilot. I wasn’t paying attention to where I was going, but anywhere ***it*** wasn’t was better than where I was. I could hear its footsteps behind me as I ran, but that didn’t stop me. At one point I think I tripped but just got back up and kept going, I’m not sure. 



It's all a blur. And after what felt like forever I ran face first into a tree. 

This turned off my “auto pilot” and I realized that I couldn’t hear the footsteps behind me anymore. My face was burning and I felt blood running down from my nose. I couldn’t feel my legs, my lungs were on fire, and I was completely lost. 

And then I saw it.



Lights.



I force my legs to move, and get closer and closer to the lights. Through the foliage I could see the wood picket fence that surrounds my back porch. I stumbled through the fence and hurriedly opened the sliding glass door on the back deck.  



I called for her.



She answered.



I rush into the bedroom and see her lying on the bed with her crutches beside her. \\

“Where have you been, I have been worried sick!”



I didn’t tell her.



I guess the main reason I am posting this here is for answers. I haven’t slept in nights and don’t think I could ever hunt again. My wife is concerned. She has been questioning me about what happened that night. I just told her I got lost tripped, hence the bloody nose. But she knows me and knows that I never act this way. 



I don’t have any mental health problems and don’t drink, do drugs or have any history of drug use. I know what I saw. If any of you have answers or have any similar stories, I’d love to chat.



I will make a follow up post in the future so keep an eye out.

NoSleep,Don't go to the these woods. ,"In a small, forgotten town tucked between rolling hills and dense forests, there was a legend that every child learned but seldom spoke of—The Forsaken Woods. Local lore warned of strange occurrences and whispers that came from the trees, luring people with promises of hidden treasures and ethereal joys. Few ventured into the woods; those who did often returned changed, their eyes clouded with a fear that words could not express.

One  autumn evening, we group of friends—Jenna, Mark, Rachel (me) , and Tom—decided to challenge the stories. Armed with flashlights and , we set out , driven by a mix of curiosity and the thrill of the unknown.

As we entered the forest, an unnatural silence enveloped us. The air grew thick, and the scents of damp earth and decay clawed at our senses. Shadows danced at the corners of our vision. 

“I don’t like this,” I said, shivering slightly as I clutched my jacket. “Maybe we should turn back.”

But we continued walking, encouraged by the sounds of laughter. We wandered deeper into the woods, the path beneath our feet fading into an underbrush of tangled roots and bramble. Just when I was about to suggest another retreat, we stumbled upon a clearing illuminated by the silvery glow of the moon.

In the center lay an old, decrepit cabin, its door hanging from one hinge, and the windows obscured by grime and dirt. “What do you think?” Tom asked, his eyes gleaming with mischief. “Let’s check it out.”

Reluctantly we followed him inside. The air was stale, thick with a sense of dread. Dust motes danced in the beam of our flashlights, which flickered. We stepped into the living area, revealing a tattered couch, shattered furniture, and scattered remnants of a life long abandoned. Cobwebs clung to the corners like skeletal hands.

Suddenly, Mark noticed something glimmering beneath a broken floorboard. “Hey, look at this!” He pried the board loose, revealing a small, ornate box embedded in the earth. It seemed strangely out of place amidst the decay—a jewel-encrusted treasure with intricate engravings.

“What if it’s cursed?” I cautioned, but Mark dismissed my fears, eager to unearth his find. He opened the box, and a chilling  wind surged through the cabin,   flashlights turned off and everything went into darkness.

Panicking, we scrambled to reignite our lights. When we finally did, a shiver ran down our spines. Around us stood figures—shadowy, indistinct shapes with hollow eyes. We were trapped, surrounded by whispers that seeped into our  minds, chilling us to their core.

""Leave this place,"" a voice echoed, layered with pain and desperation. ""You’ve disturbed our rest.""

We turned to flee, but the trees seemed to get closer and closer, closing off our escape. The whispers grew louder, morphing into anguished cries—echoes of past wanderers lost to the woods, forever haunting the living who dared to trespass.

Desperate, Jenna recalled the stories—the townsfolk had warned that the woods demanded a sacrifice for the curiosity of the living. As the apparitions circled closer, she realized what she had to do. “We have to let it go!” she shouted. “Mark, the box!”

But he clutched it tightly, fear overtaking reason. “No! It’s mine!” The shadows engulfed him, pulling him into their midst. A scream erupted—a raw, primal sound—as Mark was dragged away, his fate sealed.

Now panicked we , stumbled through the woods, desperation driving us, the whispers taunted, urging us to join our friend in eternal darkness. I tripped over a root and fell, but Jenna pulled me to her feet. “We can’t stop! Keep moving!”

As we broke through the trees, we caught sight of light—the edge of the forest. We sprinted towards safety, our lungs screaming for breath, only to find the path narrowing once more, the woods a labyrinth of torment.

With one final push, we burst from the treeline and into the moonlit field, breathless and trembling. The whispers faded behind us but the loss of our friend hung heavy in the air—a haunting reminder of the price of our curiosity. 

Days turned into weeks, but the memory of that night haunted Jenna and me. Mark was never found. The townsfolk whispered of a new tale—the tale of a boy who journeyed too deep and was claimed by the Forsaken Woods, his spirit now among the whispers, forever warning the next curious souls about the price of trespassing.

NoSleep,My Son Keeps Telling Me About 'The Man With No Eyes' in His Room.,"It started just after we moved in. Nothing dramatic at first - just my four-year-old Liam talking about ""the man with no eyes.""

""Mommy, he was in my room again,"" he said over breakfast, pushing his Cheerios around. I did what any mom would do - told him it was just a dream. But Liam wouldn't let it go.

""No, he's real. He stands in the corner and watches me. Even without eyes, he sees everything.""

Every morning brought another story about the man. I kept telling myself it was just the stress of moving, that kids get weird about new houses. The price had been surprisingly low, but in this market, I hadn't questioned our luck. But then one morning, Liam said something that made my skin crawl.

""He told me his name,"" Liam whispered, clutching his dinosaur. ""He says he's called Michael. He says he's lonely here. He wants someone to watch with him.""

Michael. The name stopped me cold. The previous owner had been Michael - just another name buried in the paperwork I'd barely glanced at. The realtor had mentioned he'd moved out suddenly, leaving most of his furniture behind. But hearing that name from Liam's mouth felt wrong.

Things got worse. Liam stopped sleeping through the night. He'd wake up crying, saying Michael was getting closer. First the corner, then the foot of his bed, then right next to his pillow. He started talking about ""the watching game"" - how Michael wanted him to watch things with him, all the time, never blinking, never stopping.

One night, I couldn't take it anymore. I waited outside his door after bedtime, listening. At 3 AM, I heard him.

""Please... please don't come closer. I don't want to play the watching game anymore.""

His voice was so small.

I burst in and hit the lights. Liam was huddled against his headboard, tears running down his face, staring at the corner by his toy chest.

""He's still there,"" he whimpered, grabbing my nightgown. ""He doesn't like the light, but he's still there. I can see where his eyes should be. He says if I keep watching with him, I'll see everything too.""

I called the realtor the next morning. To hell with the mortgage - we needed out. She seemed unsurprised, almost like she'd been expecting my call.

We packed in a rush, throwing everything into boxes. As we drove away, I felt like I could breathe again. Then Liam looked out the window.

""Mommy... Michael says he's sad you're leaving. He says he liked it better when he wasn't alone. He needs someone to watch with.""

Days later, I couldn't help myself. I waited until Liam was playing with his blocks and looked up our old house. The first result made my heart stop - a news article from just six months ago about Michael Andrews, the previous owner.

Police had found him in the crawl space after neighbors complained about a smell. They'd ruled it a suicide, but the details were strange. He'd been a night security guard at an art gallery, and his final log entry mentioned ""learning to see everything"" and ""watching without eyes."" They found him surrounded by photographs of people sleeping, watching, always watching. His body was mutilated, especially his eyes. In his final note, he wrote about achieving ""true sight"" and needing to ""share it with others."" I slammed the laptop shut, but the damage was done.

I must have made some sound, because Liam looked up at me then. His smile was... different. Wrong.

""Michael says we're his new family now,"" Liam whispered, still smiling that awful smile. ""He followed us here because he needs us to learn to watch like he does. He says once you start watching, you can never stop.""

That night, I caught Liam staring at me while I slept. His eyes were wide, unblinking. Watching. Always watching.",624,0.97,22,Elegant_Butterfly_26,2024-11-07 14:52:47,1gm0t2l,646,High
NoSleep,I was stalked through shopping lists,"

Until a couple of days ago, I was certain cell phones saved my life.  

Back in the before-times (I’m bringing out my old man voice here), we wrote so many things on paper:  Quick notes, directions, addresses, and most of all, shopping lists.  When used up, they mostly made it in the garbage bins since those were on many street corners.  

Even with the bins everywhere, some of these papers ended up on the ground. Sometimes they slipped out of our purses and pockets, other times they just missed the garbage.  There these papers would lie until a good Samaritan picked them up for garbage, or folks like my friend, J, and I picked them up. 

J and I enjoyed collecting these scraps of paper.  We loved figuring out the stories about the hidden lives of the people all around us through the hints in these pieces of paper.  We were fascinated to see what things people were buying.  Sometimes you would find a common theme around the list: “tomatoes, bell peppers, Italian seasoning, noodles” … the person is planning an Italian meal; “bread, lunch meat, cheese, juice, nuts” … someone planning their lunches.  

The fun ones had stars or underlined items emphasized, something that set those lists apart from all the rest.  If we were really lucky, my friend and I would find a short note or letter instead of the shopping lists.  Go near a school and you’d be more likely to find the special mom note: “Love you honey! Have a great day at school.”  Maybe it had the rare dad note: “You can never go hungry at a magical beach … not with all the Sand Witches around!”  These notes, though, could appear anywhere.  It was the special notes that we found just wandering the city that had the special appeal to us.  

For the two of us, this became a joyful hobby.  Lots of scraps of paper that we’d pick up and eventually recycle, so we were saving the planet as well.  It was harmless fun.  

Until it wasn't.





I still have the piece of paper that started everything off.  Below is everything it says:

“3/15/05 Groceries.  Sodas.  Waters.  Powerade.  Pizza.  Pasta Dinner.  Lasagna (party next week).  Chips (party next week).  Salsa (party next week).  Tomatoes.  Peppers.  Cayenne.  

I see you picking these up.”

I called my friend with the paper in my hand.  

“Umm, J.  Just found this on the ground.”

“That’s a cool one!”

“Yeah … cool.”

With just a quick phrase, we blew this off as just a list with a special note and moved on.  

A couple of weeks later, I got a call from J. 

“So, maybe that wasn’t just a cool note after all.”

“Huh?”

“That ‘I see you picking these up’ note.  Yeah, I don’t think that was just a cool note.  I found one too.  Starts out with a shopping list.  But then it ended with ‘I see you picking these up also.’”

J and I got together and compared the shopping lists.  The handwriting on the items was the same on each slip of paper.  The handwriting at the bottom was the same on both slips of paper too … but different from the handwriting of the items.  While technically we were invading the privacy of others (especially when those weren’t shopping lists lying on the ground), we were also picking up trash in public spaces.  This was the private lives folks didn’t mind leaving around town (or maybe it slipped out of their pockets, but still, in the public space).  These messages seemed … directed.  Like an invasion of OUR privacy.

“What do you think these mean?”

I shrugged.

“I guess we have our own special note now.”  J’s voice - if my memory is correct - lifted at the end of the sentence.

""I guess so.  Not sure I want it.”

“Me neither. ""



Through the next weeks, we could see the effects of the cell phone’s advancement.  Cheaper and cheaper phones had cameras and texting was easier, so paper was less necessary.  Still, we found some slips here and there.  There was nothing out of the ordinary on those slips.  Not until the middle of the summer. 

“It says, ‘Why are you still picking these up?’”

“You got that one too?”

“Yeah.”

“Are we doing anything wrong?”

“Wrong?  What is wrong about picking up paper?  We’re cleaning up the sidewalk at the very least.”

“Right, right.”

December of 2005.  The loose paper is harder to find, but every slip now comes with a message from this thing that’s following us.  

“Ha!  Cleaning the planet.  Whatever you say.”  “This is what you had for dinner last night.”  “You two have predictable patterns.”  
  
More details slipped into the notes.  Whatever was leaving them could hear and see us.  It commented on our clothing, our meals, even our sleep.  

The stalking became more obvious with the last few slips that we found.  

“Watched you snooze your alarm twice.”  “I have a knife.”  “Do you recognize these?” and some squares of our clothing.





The last slip we ever found happened when my friend and I were out together.  We passed a school and a piece of paper was lying on the sidewalk.  We looked at each other and debated on picking it up.  On the one hand, the possibility of a guardian’s note - the prize finds.  On the other hand … we didn’t want to know what the bottom would say.  The wind picked up a little and one of us stepped on the paper so it wouldn’t blow away.  

“I guess that means we’re picking it up.”

This slip of paper was only a special message to us.  This time, the coloring was off, a dried rust color.  The message was “I’m watching you right now.”

We ripped up the paper and found the nearest trash can.  

J and I took any of the papers we hadn’t yet recycled and we quickly made plans to burn them all, especially those with the strange directed notes.  We created a bonfire on the night of a full moon.  We threw whatever spices and plants we could find into the fire between notes.  J and I knew nothing (still don’t know anything) about demonology and exorcisms.  We just knew we needed a little nature and something cleansing between the notes.  

My friend and I hoped this would be the end of everything.

2007 brought the advent of the iPhone.  With that, the slips of paper were done.  

I hadn’t thought about these messages or the time my friend and I had this hobby for a while now.  Except I found a piece of paper in front of my car at a parking lot.  It was flipped written side up and all it said was: 

“I’m still watching you.”

NoSleep,Don't Listen to the Music of DJ Erich Zann,"I need to find DJ Erich Zann.  

Or, more specifically, the DJ formerly known as Erich Zann.  He’s changed his name; his Spotify and YouTube all his socials have been nuked.  He’s definitely left New York.  But he’s out there somewhere.  Making more of his strange, disynchronous, yet hypnotic music.  Building a new fanbase.  Luring them in, before… well, a repeat of what happened at The P\*\*\*\*\* in Bushwick.  

Twenty-nine people dead.  An electrical fire, the investigators claimed.  Faulty wiring.  You know how it is with these poorly-maintained, converted warehouses.  A fire, the local news repeated.  “Fire” was the story they were sticking to.  If anyone from the FBI or the CIA or any shadowy X Files agency knows any better, they aren’t saying anything at all.  

\*\*\*\*\*

A bartender buddy of mine, Andy, recommended me for the DJ Erich Zann gig.  

*Dude you up to work a concert in Bushwick?*  He’d texted me.  *A guy called last night, said he found my business card.  But I’m already booked on the Lower East Side.  Pays $100 for the night, plus tips.  Really small gig, shouldn’t be much work.*

I said I’d do it.  I recognized the address.  The P\*\*\*\*\* was an old warehouse at the ass-end of Bushwick, wedged into a corner between the Queens County border and the cemetery, surrounded by other abandoned warehouses - tagged up, with metal-roofed awnings and those huge roll-up doors you see on industrial properties.  The owners had re-wired and re-designed the inside, to be rented out for art shows, concerts, and club nights.  

Andy sent me a photo of the event’s promotional flier.  It was shiny black, with a childlike drawing of a stick-figure girl leading a huge, fluffy monster on a leash.  The design appeared cute at first glance, but the longer you looked at it, the more disturbing it became.  The monster's crudely-drawn human face was too large for its body.  Its toothy mouth seemed less a friendly smile than a threatening sneer.  *DJ Erich Zann.  10pm.* 

I spent some time internet-stalking DJ Erich Zann.  The guy played up the mystique, for sure.  I found only one photo of the DJ himself, and it wasn’t a particularly revealing one.  Just a man, in a Cthulhu mask and turtleneck, standing behind a sound board, with long sleeves and gloves on his hands.  

I clicked into his YouTube.

*DJ Erich Zann*, the profile read.  *We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity.*  

H.P. Lovecraft.  He’d also stolen his stage name from an H.P. Lovecraft story.  Adorable.

I hit play on a video titled Asenath #14.  25K views; 1,500 likes; comments disabled. 

The music started slow and low, pounding bass over a hazy, barely-perceptible electronic rumble.  On the video screen, against an empty background, bits of white light swirled and exploded and pulled back together, then split into pulsating stars in primary colors.  A trilling instrumental melody stretched over the repetitive bass-line, rising and falling and shooting off into a million different directions, as the colorful stars on screen spun like pinwheels, light blending and shifting and modulating, before a frenetic piping overcame the instrumental tapestry…

“Wow!  FIFTY percent off!  Bill’s Better Secondhand Furniture post-Labor Day sale!”

I muted my laptop as an ad replaced the hypnotic EDM melody.  Asenath #14 had been really short.  

Except, it wasn’t.  Asenath #14 was 33 minutes, 45 seconds long.  

I frowned.  No way I’d listened to that song for over a half an hour.  

\*\*\*\*\*

I called the number Andy gave me; no one picked up.  So, around eight thirty, I walked from the train station to The P\*\*\*\*\*, down an alley to the back parking lot and employee entrance.  There was clearly something going on - I could hear the *thud, thud, thud* of electronic bass.  But, unlike every other time I’d worked the venue, there were no roadies trudging in and out with heavy equipment.  There were no people around at all.  

No cars in the back parking lot either, except for one camper van.  That, in and of itself, wouldn’t be surprising - plenty of touring musicians live out of vans.  But this one was odd because it was completely blacked out.  I’m not talking about tinted windows.  Someone had taken the effort to cover every spot where light might seep through with opaque, dull black material.  

*Asshole’s committed to the aesthetic*, I thought.

Even stranger, the rolling door of the loading dock was still closed and locked.  As was the employee door. There was a handwritten sign posted there: ABSOLUTELY NO ENTRY UNTIL 10PM.

My next thought was the one that, in a roundabout way, saved my life.

It went: *screw that upside down, backwards and sideways.*  

The promo fliers said the event started at 10:00.  Which meant, the moron who’d posted the sign assumed I’d be able to set up a full bar while dealing with a line full of guests wanting to get liqueured up before the show.  Lucky for me, I’d poured wine at a gallery popup at The P\*\*\*\*\* two weekends before.  And I’d forgotten to return the key.

The way The P\*\*\*\*\* is set up, the bar is in a separate, smaller backroom, connected to the showroom by a squat hallway.  The employee door opened into the backroom, where I found my crates of liquor already deposited on top of the bar.  The throbbing bass line I’d heard outside emanated from the showroom, rhythmic and looping.  I saw moving shadows.  I assumed the tech guys were all in there.  

I got to work organizing bottles as the last of the summer evening light faded to darkness, bass booming in my head, guiding my movements like a conductor.  An hour later, I had to pee.  I didn’t want to annoy the roadies, or piss off whoever didn’t want me in The P\*\*\*\*\* before ten, but the venue’s only bathrooms were in the showroom, and the building was isolated amongst a sea of empty warehouses, and my only other option was to whip it out in the parking lot.  

So I went.  At the end of the hallway, I froze.

There were figures setting up the stage, but they weren’t roadies.

They were pitch-black automatons shaped like naked, featureless, sexless humans; mannequins at the mall become animate.  Their skin looked the consistency of clay.  They moved fluidly, more organic than robotic.  There were six of them.  Each had arms and legs and, in lieu of a head, a cube-shaped protuberance emitting small peals of grey smoke as they lifted crates of lights and arranged amps on the main stage.

I yelped.  I backpedaled.  My foot caught on something; I stumbled, a weight gave way, and the music stopped.  I realized the looped bass-line had come from a laptop, plugged in on the floor.  I’d tripped over it.  I’d hit a button or two.  I’d killed the music.  

SLAM!  CRASH!

Metal framing was dropped.  The sound board hit the elevated stage with a hollow THUD!  Everything the claylike, pitch-black, humanoid faux-roadies had been carrying fell to the ground.

As the faux-roadies themselves melted, like butter in a pan, into gelatinous black puddles.

\*\*\*\*\*

After The P\*\*\*\*\* incident - after that night - I scoured the internet for people who knew DJ Erich Zann.  People who could explain to me who he actually was.  Or who he’d been before he was DJ Erich Zann.

*He kinda just appeared on Spotify in 2021*, one Redditor wrote.

*I thought he was an AI*, said another.  

*Didn’t he die in a fire at his concert in Brooklyn?*  Asked yet another.  *I dunno, maybe start there?  His family must’ve said something.*

His family - if they existed - hadn’t uttered a word.  I’d scoured the internet for an actual photograph of DJ Erich Zann, or even a recording of his voice, and came up with nothing.  

Finally, User Gregg87 direct messaged me.

*DJ Erich Zann was my roommate*, he wrote.  *I’ll be in NYC next week for Tech Week.  I can tell you everything.*  

\*\*\*\*\*

Gregg87 is a real guy, with a real name and a family and a life in Pasadena, California.  But for privacy purposes, I’ll refer to him here as, simply, Greg.  Greg is an aerospace engineer with a Master’s degree.  We met at a quiet coffee shop in Williamsburg.  He’d known DJ Erich Zann while they were both college students in the late two thousands. 

“James Hadley,” Greg told me.  “That’s his real name.”

James Hadley and Greg shared a Pasadena apartment, a few blocks from the university they both attended, during Greg’s senior year of college.  James, though a year younger, was already three years into a Ph.D. program in theoretical physics.  Their residential situation had been arranged by university student services; for half a semester, Greg said, it felt more like living with a skittish cat than another young adult.

James spent every minute he wasn’t on campus barricaded in his room, working through equations or practicing his electric violin with headphones in.  Whenever he inadvertently found himself in the same room with Greg, he’d lower his eyes and scurry away like a cockroach in the light.  

Greg felt sorry for him.  He made it his mission to befriend his reclusive roommate, approaching the task as one would set about domesticating a feral pet.  Greg stopped studying in his room; instead, he’d arrange himself on the couch in the common room, hook his laptop to the TV, and play old Star Trek episodes as background noise.  On the rare occasion James emerged from his room, Greg would invite him to sit and watch.  At first, James might linger for a few minutes.  Then, he started sitting down beside Greg.  Finally, after a month of warming up, he brought own work into the common room so they could study together.  When that became comfortable, James - at long last - began to speak.

“It was school stuff, at first,” Greg told me.  “His area was string theory unification… universe-building stuff, the interchange between particle physics and a potential tapestry of infinite planes… I’m not even sure I can explain it correctly.  Eventually, though, I got him to open up about his life outside his research.  You know, his family.”

James Hadley had been the beloved only child of successful parents.  When they’d realized their seven-year-old could solve advanced algebraic equations and play Mozart on the violin, they lobbied James’s small private academy to skip him from second grade to seventh. He excelled both academically and musically, but his relationship with other children was a source of anxiety.  The bigger boys in the neighborhood bullied him for being “weird,” while his pre-teen classmates treated him as more spectacle than friend.  

Finally, his parents pulled him out of school altogether.  His mother - a professor at Cal State LA’s School of Education - taught him at home until, aged thirteen, James was accepted into a prestigious university.  His mom and dad switched off driving him to and from college, even after he finished undergrad and began his Ph.D. coursework, until that year.  That year, his parents both died: his mother, in March, after a long battle with breast cancer; his father, in July, from a sudden heart attack.  Without them, James felt alone in the world.  They weren’t just family; they’d been his cheerleaders, his most enthusiastic supporters, his only friends.

“I don’t know how to live in society,” James admitted to Greg.  “I want friends my own age.  I want to go to parties, to socialize, to find my people.  I just… can’t.”

“How about music?”  Greg asked him.  “Maybe try and find a band to play with.”

James took that advice to heart.  He bought himself a guitar and practiced in garages with stoners he met on Craigslist.  But it wasn’t a fit.  The guy wasn’t built to be a rocker - he was too self-conscious, too anal, a black hole of charisma.  Then, Greg had an epiphany.  Electronic music was still relatively niche then, still geeky.  James was intrigued.  A cousin of Greg’s bought ProTools to mess with as a hobby, then lost interest; Greg convinced him to sell his entire setup to James at a discount. 

“As a DJ, he could play a character,” Greg explained.  “He could venture out into the world, be the life of the party, surround himself with people - without bursting his bubble.”

And it worked.  It worked better than Greg could’ve ever imagined.

James, a musical prodigy with technical skills, took to ProTools like a duck to water.  The ability to produce sounds no human voice or human hands could produce, for him, was the purest form of creation.  His music blended sounds and rhythms together that shouldn’t have mixed, yet did, into hypnotic harmonies that transfixed listeners.  Greg connected him to high school buddies at other LA universities; soon, James had built a small following and a solid side hustle as a frat party entertainer.  He went through a few names: DJ Schrodinger, StarboyXJH, Majorana Fermion.  

“It should’ve stayed that way,” Greg said wistfully.  “I thought he was happy.  But James always wanted more.”

One night, Greg was out studying at a friend’s house when he got a text from James.  *Come home now*, the text read, with twenty exclamation points.  Greg did as he was told.  When he arrived, he found his usually-restrained roommate bouncing around like an excited puppy.

“You have to see this!” he exclaimed, dragging Greg into his room and shutting the door.  He turned out the lights, typed a few keys on his computer, and closed his eyes as music flowed forth.  

“There was a recorder, piping over a string quartet, over a brass band, over a bass line that sounded like a train approaching” Greg said.  “I thought I heard screaming cats in there somewhere, too.  All the different melodies came together, then broke apart, then… curved.  Can music curve?”

Mesmerized, Greg eventually realized he was no longer in James’s room.  

They were outside - he felt the warm air against his face - on an alien planet with a rich maroon sky.  Obsidian-black tundra stretched forever into the distance on all sides, dotted with throbbing golden orbs emitting the feeling of rough sandpaper.  James stood there with him and, before them, a black swamp bubbled.  Tar-like globules crawled out.  Like snakes to a snake charmer, or flowers to the sun, they reached with wormy black tendrils towards the music, and began to sway in time with the rhythm.  

“I don’t know how long it lasted,” Greg said.  “Time meant nothing.  Then, I was back in James’s room, balled up on the floor.”

As soon as the room stopped spinning and Greg regained his ability to speak, he demanded James tell him what he’d done to them.  James grinned from ear to ear.

“The promise of string theory,” he said.  “I manipulated matter with my music.  I changed our vibrations.  I took us to another dimension.”

“Shit, James,” Greg stammered.  “What if… what if we couldn’t get back?  Or if we got hurt or something?”

James smiled wider.  “You don’t need to worry about that.  We’re ghosts there.  Nothing could touch us.”

Greg had to admit: the experience of transporting himself to another dimension, through music, had been cool.  Soon, James incorporated interdimensional tourism into his live sets.  He conjured up bubbly pink jungles with cute flying felines, or forests full of multicolored plants and bugs that resembled the drawings of sugar-high kindergarteners, or stark rocky seashores where blood-red waves met a blanket of thick, blue snow.  He gained himself a reputation, amongst Southern California sorority girls and underground EDM fans, as the DJ whose music could generate hallucinations without drugs.  

James should’ve been happy.  Yet still, he wasn’t satisfied.

On a rainy winter night, Greg returned home late.  He heard violin music emanating from James’s room.  The song was fast and frenetic, jumping around from high octaves to low, jarring and nerve-rattling.  Tired and annoyed, Greg went straight to James’s room and shoved open the door.

Lights flashed from his computer, which James was connected to via his headphones.  Acoustic violin at his chin, James’s hands danced like dying spiders, racing up and down the neck of the instrument.  His eyes stared straight ahead, bloodshot and unthinking.  On his face, an expression of unspeakable pain and horror. 

Greg ran to him and pulled off his headphones, accidentally dislodging them from their jack in the process.  Music - the music that had driven his roommate to his current state - filled the room.  And Greg felt himself tugged violently into James’s nightmare.  

They were trapped in an endless cave, illuminated only by a greenish glow.  Metallic spikes, jagged stalagmites, covered the walls and ceiling and floor, jutting out as though to impale prey.  A milky-white substance, the consistency of glue, moistened the spikes like saliva.  

A grey thing lurked behind James.  

A faceless man, made of grey liquid steel.  Bubbling and dripping and re-congealing, it arms wrapped around his waist, leaving his arms free to fiddle like a madman.  It bent its hulking form, head over James’s head, lips locked to his temple as though it were drinking him.  

Greg froze, so disturbed by the liquid steel monster he didn’t immediately notice the small creature sniffing at his feet.  It was a thing the size of a puppy and the shape of a hamster, resembling a sentient steel wool sponge.  It opened a mouth, much too large, and flashed dripping grey teeth like the surrounding stalagmites.  It stared up at Greg with gelatinous yellow eyes.  

Then, the world spun.  Everything went black.

Greg woke sometime later, sprawled on the floor of James’s room, behind his desk, surrounded by silence.  A trickle of blood dripped down his forehead.  He pulled himself to his knees and fell against the wall, eyes clinched shut, grasping for a timeline.  James got stuck in another dimension.  Greg heard the music, he went there too.  They were supposed to be ghosts; nothing was supposed to touch them.  But something did, a creature of molten metal, and it attached itself to James.  Greg passed out.  As he fell, his body slammed against James’s computer, cutting the music and launching them back into their appropriate reality.

*James.*  Where was James?

Greg forced his eyes open.  James lay on the ground hear him, breath shallow, eyes wide and distant.  Greg crawled to him.  James’s lips moved.  

“A thousand,” he muttered.  “A thousand.  A thousand.”

Then he fell quiet, and his eyes finally closed.  

Greg couldn’t wake his roommate.  He dragged him to bed, wrapped him in blankets, and watched him for hours, terrified he’d stop breathing.  Finally, exhausted, Greg fell asleep in James’s desk chair.  When he awoke the next morning, James was gone.

He found his roommate in the kitchen, brewing a pot of coffee, smiling.

“What the heck, James?”  Greg stammered.  “Last night… what was that?”

James eyed Greg strangely.  “Um, nothing happened last night?  I have no idea what you’re talking about.”  

Greg gaped.  He reached up and felt the welt over his eye, scraped off dried blood, just to remind himself he hadn’t dreamed the entire thing.  

“Your violin playing!” he insisted.  “The cave with all the spikes.  The metallic lava man…eating you.  The steel wool guinea pig?  You don’t remember any of this?”

James shrugged.  “Get a therapist, man.  I think you’re hallucinating.”

As he turned his back, Greg saw an odd mark on James’s neck.  A bruise the size of a hickey.  Grey and shiny, like a smudge of silver metallic paint.

After that day, James became a different person.

Wallflower James, who lived in sweats and anime t-shirts, began wearing polos and styling his dirty-blonde hair.  Shy James, all of a sudden, attracted an entourage of frat boys who’d carry his DJ equipment and chill with him at dive bars.  James, who’d previously spent his free nights reading pulp sci-fi and commenting on classical violin blogs, cultivated a Facebook wall full of photos from drunken club nights, his arms draped around inebriated girls in short dresses.  Virgin James, who couldn’t look a woman in the eye without blushing, now texted Greg three times a week to stay out of the apartment - because James would be occupied there with a one-night playmate.  

“I should’ve been supportive, I guess,” Greg admitted.  “I’d been trying to lure him out of his comfort zone.  But that cocky womanizer with bottle service - he wasn’t James.”  

It was nearly May by then, and Greg had been accepted into MIT for a Master’s program.  He’d also begun dating his future wife.  With finals looming and his roommate inflicted with douchebag brain worms, he was more than happy to spend his days in the library and his nights with his girlfriend. 

“I’d basically moved out already”, he said.  Then, he sighed.  “A professor of mine lent me a book, and I’d forgotten about it.  I wanted to return it before the school year ended.”

Determined to collect the borrowed book, Greg reluctantly returned to the apartment he shared with James - for the last time, he promised himself.  But as he approached the door, he felt  and heard the familiar rumbling of an EDM bass line.  

*Great*, Greg thought.  *He must have a lady friend over.*

To save himself from an unsolicited porn soundtrack, he hooked his earphones up to his iPod and blasted 90’s hip-hop as he unlocked the door.  Quick as he could, he located the book under a pile of menus, then did a round of the common space, picking up random odds and ends he didn’t want to leave behind.  

Then, *Party Up* by DMX was interrupted by a woman’s scream.

Greg acted on instinct.  He ran to James’s room and forced his way through the locked door.  In the process, his earphones were torn from his ears.  And James’s music dragged him, kicking and screaming, into oblivion.  

He was back in the subterranean cave with jagged spikes and the ghostly greenish glow.  The spikes, ever so slowly, moved.  Curled and extended, refracting the hazy green light into colors and shades Greg couldn’t describe with words.  The milky-white glue substance extended from spike to spike like a spiderweb, dripping down in thick globules. 

And James was there.  He stood stock-still, the faceless grey liquid steel man behind him.  Embracing him.  Moist, metallic tentacles wrapped around his arms and legs and torso, gripping his neck and face like long-fingered hands.  Bleeding into his skin.  Enveloping him, like a defective superhero’s suit.  The grey man was James.  James was the grey man.  His eyes were wide, bulging, and empty.

There was a shuffle at his feet.  Greg looked down - and doubled over with nausea.  What was left of a brown-haired young woman lay on the ground.  Her throat had been torn out; her head folded back unpleasantly, unspooled muscles and tendons splayed like streamers.  

A creature buried itself in her chest.  In a gruesome second, Greg recognized the thing as the steel wool hamster, now the size of a Rottweiler.  Its metal fur curled menacingly like a tangle of barbed wire.  It jerked upwards, turned its large face towards Greg.  Its putty yellow eyes glowed with malice.  It clutched a hunk of red meat between jagged teeth.  With a turn of his stomach, Greg realized the chunk of flesh was the dead girl’s heart.  

The creature tossed its head, swallowing the heart whole.  Then, it redirected its rabid attentions towards Greg.  

It lunged.  

Greg, in a fit of survival instinct, grabbed his earbuds and forced them into his ears.  James’s reality-altering EDM creation was blocked out by DMX.

The steel wool monster gnashed its teeth angrily, pressed up against an invisible force field, restrained like a dog on a chain.  Greg turned up the volume on his iPod.  He knew he didn’t have much time.  Avoiding the living spikes, he found his way to James’s computer.  He tore wires, slammed the laptop against the wall, kicked and stomped and smashed the expensive sound board until it was reduced to a shattered hunk of plastic and rubber and metal.  

Finally, he pulled out his earphones.  

He’d returned to James’s room.  The air smelled like pennies, with an under-scent of sulfur.  The girl’s destroyed body rested in a pool of blood and entrails.  And of course, there was James.

James lay on his back, bloodshot eyes wide and unblinking.  As Greg stood over him, he barely seemed to breathe, his chest contracting weakly under a pit-stained tank top.  Greg saw a new marking on his arm - a long, blue-grey bruise.  Like the hickey on the back of his neck, it caught the light like rusting metal.  

His lips moved.  He forced out words.  

“Nine…hundred.  Ninety five.  More.”

Greg fled the apartment.  He banged on a neighbor’s door, called the police.  The cops arrived to find the young woman, dead, on the bedroom floor.  

James had disappeared.

\*\*\*\*\*

“The Bushwick concert, that wasn’t the first,” Greg insisted.  “There’ve been others, in South America.  Ibiza.  He keeps moving.  Keeps changing his name.  He never allows himself to get too popular.  It’s always small shows… thirty people or less.  Because if he were some big celebrity…”

*He’d attract too much attention.*  Yeah.  Fame would be anathema to a creature like DJ Erich Zann.  Best to chip away slowly, a couple dozen doomed fans at a time.  

“What did it mean?” I asked Greg.  “The last thing he said to you.  Nine hundred, ninety five more.”

Greg met my eyes.  *He knew.  He knew I knew.*  

“That girl,” he said.  “Her name was Devyn Slade.  She’d been an art student, recently aged out of foster care.  And she wasn’t his first, either.”

What composure remained on Greg’s face broke down.

“Four other girls went missing, around the same time.  Over the next few years the police found all of them, buried in shallow graves on opposite ends of the county.  They never connected the dead girls back to James, not officially.  But… well, I did.  Because they’d been mauled.  Their hearts torn out of their chests.”

\*\*\*\*\*

Greg’s story ended there.  Mine… didn’t.

That night, at The P\*\*\*\*\*, I’d killed the music. DJ Erich Zann’s black automaton roadies melted into gelatinous black puddles.

Heart stuck in my throat, stomach in knots, I eased over to a puddle.  I extended a toe.

*Bump, bump, bump.*

The bass started up again.  The puddles bubbled in time with the music.  Gummy arms popped out of the mess, pressed against the ground, formed torsos.

“I said, no entry until ten.”

I whirled, away from the re-emerging humanoids and towards that grating, robotic, alien voice.  My pulse pounded in my ears.  Beads of perspiration formed on my palms and the back of my neck.  My neurons rejected my eyes, and I couldn’t breathe.  

James Hadley - DJ Erich Zann - stood in front of me, shirtless and bare-faced.  

His flesh - if you could call it flesh - alternated between metallic blue-black patches that refracted light and rotting dark-green tissue that sloughed, hanging off him, dripping foul-smelling liquid.  Bits of his arms had disintegrated, revealing silver-stained muscle.  He had no nose and no lips and no teeth, just gaping black holes.  He was bald; black mold extended across his scalp.  His bulging eyes, cloudy-white, stood out in bas relief - and, though I couldn’t see pupils, I felt fury laser-focused on me.  

Footsteps, behind me.  His black putty roadies had stabilized.  

And they’d blocked all the exits.

What saved my life that night was a combination of luck and the venue owners’ carelessness.  I’d bartended many events there.  So I knew, behind the stage, a secret trapdoor and hidden staircase lead to the basement.  I knew the basement was accessible via another staircase that opened, through cellar doors, to the street.  And I knew the owners constantly forgot to lock said cellar doors.

I ran, then walked, then collapsed into a heap and cried.  Then ran again, walked, cried, rinse and repeat, until I sank onto a bench along Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, legs too numb to move.  I should have, I realized then, called the police.  

*The police would’ve thought I was high*, I told myself.  *And even if they’d believed me, it wouldn’t have made any difference.*

\*\*\*\*\*

Twenty-nine people died at the concert.  The youngest was nineteen; the oldest, fifty-one.  They were students, baristas, poets, stockbrokers, teachers, biologists, taxi drivers, spouses, and parents.  Music lovers, who’d only wanted to lose themselves for a night.  

Their loved ones were told they’d all died in an electrical fire, due to rats biting through the wires.  The press, outside of a few local outfits, didn’t pay the incident as much attention as I thought it deserved.  Who cares about a few dead hipsters, right?  But many people - family and friends, reporters, low-ranking cops and paramedics who’d seen the aftermath - weren’t satisfied with the answers they were given.  And, as often happens when answers are scarce and higher-ups shut down, certain individuals started asking questions a little louder.  

For instance, if all twenty-nine victims died in a fire, why had autopsies revealed no smoke in their lungs?  Why were the bodies they’d recovered, recovered in pieces?  How had an electrical fire torn limbs from sockets with the force of an elephant, or bitten into chests with jaws as wide as a shark’s?  Why was every single recovered torso missing its heart?

And - as a frustrated investigator asked, while showing me a photograph I’m sure he wasn’t supposed to reveal - what was the meaning of the words written on the wall?

I stared at the words, scrawled in jagged letters, as though by the nails of a broken and bleeding hand.

NoSleep,My mum's acting strange and I think it has something to do with the new mirror,"The first incident occurred a week ago, three days after the mirror arrived. I woke up at seven thirty in the morning to a chilling cold, so disabling I could barely get out of bed. You might think that’s just me being a dramatic teenager, but it was a cold like I’d never experienced before. It cut through the skin. I’ve visited cousins in Norway on Christmas holidays that were warmer.

My first thought was that the central heating hadn’t been turned on, which was strange in itself considering that's the first thing my mum does in the morning. She wakes up each day at six on the dot, so when I get up an hour and a half later the house is usually nice and toasty. I don’t *expect* her to do these things like some spoiled brat, if that’s what you’re thinking, she just does them because she’s a considerate mother.

Anyway, I assumed she had either slept through her alarm or that, for whatever reason, it had failed to go off. Jane Harris isn’t exactly the type of person to sleep through an alarm, so I decided it must be the latter.

Once I’d plucked up enough courage to confront the piercing cold, I headed for her bedroom. In the corridor, the wood flooring felt like ice beneath my bare feet, and I instantly regretted not putting my slippers on.

Her door was closed when I reached it, which was odd because she usually keeps it slightly ajar for the cat to go in and out throughout the night. I put my ear to the solid wood but heard nothing. I knocked twice.

No answer.

I knocked again, the added force stinging my knuckles.

Again, no answer.

At this point I was quite worried, and a vicious image suddenly entered my mind of my mother in some type of danger. Hastily, I opened the door.

However, when I entered the room, I saw that she wasn’t in danger at all. In fact, she wasn’t even asleep. She was sat in her chair, fully dressed, looking into the mirror.

‘Is everything okay mum?’ I asked.

At first she didn’t notice me, but after a few seconds she caught my reflection and smiled.

‘Hello darling,’ she said.

I flinched.

There was something about her voice. Something that sounded… off.

I could feel my guts suddenly churn, and the sensation of a deep pit opening in my chest overwhelmed me. Inhaling deeply, I tried to gather myself. And then it hit me.

I’d heard that voice before.

*It must be the cold*, I quickly realised, shaking my head. God knows how long mum had been sitting there wearing only her work clothes. She had probably caught the flu or something.

‘Are you okay?’ I asked again.

She didn’t answer.

‘Mum?’

I caught the hint of a frown in her mirror’s reflection, so I called out to her again, and this time she turned around to face me. For a moment it was like looking into the eyes of a stranger, and then she sprang to life.

‘Sorry,’ she said, colour suddenly rushing into her face. ‘Something must’ve come over me.’ She pulled herself up from her chair, looked around the room and frowned. ‘Gosh, isn’t it cold in here?’ she remarked.

The second incident happened yesterday.

I woke up in the middle of the night needing to pee, accosted by the same violent cold. On my way to the bathroom, with my slippers on this time, I heard a noise from the end of the corridor. It was coming from my mum’s room.

Curious, I detoured towards the noise, my ears alert. It was dark in the corridor, so I tried flicking the table lamp on, and almost knocked a framed picture off the wall. It was my parent’s old wedding photo, the only image of dad mum refuses to take down. I turned on the lamp, readjusted the picture and continued moving.

I reached the end of the corridor and perked my head around the corner. Again, mum’s door was closed, but I gathered she was awake from the thin glow beneath her door.

And from the noises.

They were louder now, and they were coming from her room.

I crept silently forward, edging towards the door, turning my head to listen.

It was a cry. Someone was in her room crying.

A chill ran down my spine like a bolt. I wanted to run away but my body propelled me forward, my hand reaching for the doorknob and twisting. I flung myself into her room.

The cold was like a tundra. My mum was sitting in front of the mirror, staring into her reflection, her nighty barely covering her thin shoulders. Her body was still but her mouth was open, and a deep cry, a man’s cry, flooded out of it. A cry I’d heard before, but not from her lips.

I screamed. I ran over to my mum and shook her. She remained still, completely unaware of my presence, her eyes hooked to the pair in the mirror. I reached beneath her arms and pulled her from the chair. Her body felt like the heaviest object in the world, and it took every inch of my strength to lift her. We both went crashing to the floor.

The crying ceased.

‘What the actual fuck mum?’ I said to her, still shaking. I helped her up off the floor, barely able to lift myself. Her face looked gaunt and frayed.

‘We need to get rid of that mirror,’ I told her.

She turned to face me, her eyes like hollowed shells. ‘Your dad wouldn’t like that,’ she said.

And that’s when I freaked out. My dad’s been missing for almost two years. As soon as she said that I left. I’m at my friend’s house right now. I don’t know how long I can stay here but at some point, I need to return home. I don’t know what to do.",129,0.98,18,Creative_Dust_1199,2024-11-07 16:27:49,1gm31oh,147,High
NoSleep,Orion Pest Control: From The Horse's Mouth,"[Previous case](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/DKa2L3wCFI)

Nessa here. To start, I'll give yinz a brief update on our well-being after Samhain. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

On my end, I have some more scars to add to my collection, but otherwise, I'm no worse for wear. Though, I do still find myself occasionally having nightmares about beheading. Can only imagine why.

The Dead Duo are back to normal. Wes came back from his recovery with only faint, jagged marks around his throat. So faint that you can only see them if you look in the right lighting. The only sign that he came scarily close to having his head chewed off. 

In other news, Cerri put in her two weeks’ notice. Can't say I blame her. While she personally walked away from the incident unscathed, she had to witness what happened to the rest of us. She said it made her think long and hard about her future. 

Ordinarily, leaving isn't really an option for us, unless it's in a coffin; I know that sounds morbid, but that's just how it is. You all have seen how the Neighbors are when it comes to vendettas. You'll see even more about that later on in this post. But with how Cerri kind of stayed in the background, she may have a chance to get back some semblance of a normal life. 

I really do wish her luck.

After everything, office morale wasn't great for a while. It tends to happen after a rough job like that. It took a few days, but we're all back to joking with one another again. What can I say? We all love being idiots too much to let a little bit of maiming get in the way of that. (Exception: Victor is the holder of the only brain cell in Orion. He is more possessive over it than Iolo is over me.)

So there yinz have it. The world is still turning. The sun is still rising. 

The rest of this post going forward will be an excerpt from Deirdre. Since she already had her thoughts conveniently written out, I figured it would be best to use that to update yinz on her situation. Straight from the horse's mouth. With her permission, of course. 

**Her entry is as follows:**

Writing appears to help Nessa get her thoughts in order, so I'm hoping it'll do the same for me.

I suppose it would be best to begin by outlining the turmoil. Perhaps an answer will present itself there, hidden somewhere in the details. I suppose I could start with what I remember, which, admittedly, is not very much. 

There isn't a hard line in my memories that marks the end of my human life or the beginning of my servitude to the river. Between those two points in time, there is only a thick haze that I can’t see through, no matter how hard I try. Mortality seems more like a dream rather than something I'd truly had, at one point. Had I ever been married? What about children? Surely, I must have left someone behind. 

Through my servitude, I have died more times than I can count. While it doesn't happen to me in a literal sense, it is an experience I share with the doomed souls whose shirts I work tirelessly to scrub clean. I feel their last moments as if they were mine. Every suicide, every accident, every anatomical failure. 

Yet, outside of the river and outside of my premonitions… nothing. Not the wind on my face, the warmth of the sun, or the touch of the woman I'm growing to love. Nothing. 

As a Weeper, I'm secluded on the outside of both worlds. Only able to feel human for the brief moment where I live through their final tragedies. There isn't much kinship with the ones from the Mounds, either. For the most part, Weepers are relegated to the background. Rocks on the edge of the road. Unable to harness any real power. Nothing worth paying any notice to. Though, I would say that their usual apathy is for the better. 

For the longest time, I simply existed. Drifting through the decades. Grieving. Washing. Singing. Grieving. Washing. Singing. 

I didn't feel real anymore. There's a part of me that still doesn't. 

But then the Lady of Orion told me that she liked my singing. She hadn't looked at me with fear, contempt, or pity, as I'm often accustomed to. She saw me as something else. Something *more.*

And those eyes… so dark. Dark enough to lose oneself in, yet so gentle. The kind gaze of someone who truly wants to see the world around her better. I thought of them often, as well as the woman who saw the world through their soulful depths. Our first interaction had been brief. Far too brief. 

When she promised to return, I smiled. When was the last time I'd smiled? I couldn't recall. 

For just a brief moment, I was real again. And in my selfishness, I couldn't let it go. Let *her* go. 

In that regard, I truly am no better than he is, am I? 

As the days passed before I could see her again, I found myself thinking of her. Who was she? What was she like? Was she truly kind or had I been imagining all of it, merely forcing my preconceptions onto her? So many questions that needed answers. 

All I knew was that I looked forward to seeing her again. It’s truly a shame that the circumstances of our next meeting had not been better. 

Her breathing was so labored that I could hear her long before she reached the river bank. Meanwhile, her pursuer didn't make a sound. Following her silently, patiently waiting for his prey to succumb to him. 

My pulse had raced. I acted. Or, I tried to. I leapt out onto the riverbank to go to her. 

Unseen hooks buried themselves into my intestines. Pulling. Stretching. Tears sprang to my eyes. Unable to breathe, I dragged myself back in. The sensation alleviated, though I still struggled to take in any air after the river's punishment. My chest quaked as my lungs refused me. 

Unable to leave or make a sound, I listened, helpless to aid the woman I'd been so curious about. 

Her frantic footsteps drew nearer. She collapsed by the bank, arms trembling. Behind her was a shadow. 

Before he could reach her, I managed to gather enough breath to yell, “Huntsman! I need her!”

The foul shadow passed her, the moonlight illuminating the captain of the Wild Hunt as he glowered at me. 

I didn't dare look into his eyes. Regardless, the sharpness of his stare pinned me in place. What cruelty is it that I can't feel her touch, but the Huntsman's gaze can penetrate through the numbness of the river? He skinned me with his eyes for daring to stop him from devouring her. 

The more I argued for her life, the more the Huntsman's stare promised. 

He is far worse than his predecessor. The captain before him had been vile as well, but more content to have their underlings do their work for them. The Dragonfly usurped them not too long ago, though I must admit that my perception of time is rather warped. It could've been three decades ago or three years ago. They've all blurred together. 

Despite my apprehension, I gathered the courage to fight for her despite barely knowing anything about the Lady of Orion. The river showed me what the Huntsman did to her father. I *felt* it. My skin peeled off until I was nothing but a miserable husk of screaming nerves. Limbs twisted, then amputated. He'd barely resembled anything more than meat by the time the Huntsman had grown bored of mutilating him. 

While the river never gave me the Lady of Orion's shirt, I didn't doubt for a moment that he had something similar in mind for her if I failed to convince him. After much back and forth while the poor woman clung to consciousness, he’d realized that he couldn’t break her vow to me and eventually acquiesced. 

I have many regrets, but saving her will never be one of them. Nor will be giving her his name. Even if his terrible promises come to fruition and he destroys me someday, it will have been worth it to know that I'd done what I could for her. 

What I do regret, however, is trapping her. She'd confessed to me once before that she believed love to be a cage. Not unlike the one her mother had fallen into. Even though I hadn't intended it at the time, I'd proven her right by trapping her in this bargain. I became her cage. 

As such, it is my responsibility to break it. 

I’d bargained with the Huntsman for her life using the rules of our world. Perhaps I can do the same for mine. And by extension, hers. At this point, we are tied together.

I waited until she went to work. She'd told me that she wanted to work to resolve our situation together and ordinarily, I would oblige that. However, she just survived a battle with the Dullahan. She's having to accept that the Huntsman will be her curse until the day either one of them gives in or perishes. Unfortunately, this Huntsman is terribly patient when it comes to matters like this. Old things like him know how to wait. He will eventually find some other way to try to enthrall her. 

Nobody deserves this curse. Nessa least of all.

Against my better judgment, I sought him out in the hopes of reasoning with him. Reasoning with a lunatic… What was I thinking? Perhaps *I’m* the real lunatic. However, I had bargained with him as well as those under his command successfully in the past. Moundfolk are covetous by nature, always seeking something. I am rue to admit that I am no exception to this. 

The Huntsman can't touch me with the hagstone. The river still has one thread left, tethering me to it. As long as that frail strand isn't severed, at the very least, he cannot take my life. 

When I arrived at his shop, he was busy with a customer. Keeping up appearances, the Huntsman gave me a brief, polite wave and smile in greeting. The customer glanced at me in reflex as the door shut behind me, raising his gray eyebrows before turning his attention back to the Huntsman.

It was surprising to see that the ‘banjo bastard’ - as Nessa eloquently likes to refer to him - looked rather sickly. He was paler than usual, his lower eyelids accentuated with dark shadows. The seeds must've been taking their toll on him. His penance for pushing himself as he did on Samhain. Orion’s vampire had served his purpose well.

Regardless of his apparent illness, he still carried himself with the easy confidence of a conqueror. Those hazel eyes were keen as they occasionally flickered towards me while the old man told him about his grandson's apparent attitude problem. The Huntsman was an excellent actor, effortlessly convincing his customer that he cared to hear any of it. Anyone that didn't know the Hunter's true nature would believe him. 

When the old man left him and me alone together, I became acutely aware of those eyes once again, glaring at me as if he sought to pry me open with one of his many tools strewn about. But despite the violence of his stare, he put on a guise of friendliness, “What brings you here?”

I reminded myself of what Nessa had said: *give yourself a chance.*

Daring to hold the Huntsman's gaze, acutely aware that the only thing protecting me from his will was a pebble with a hole in it, I inquired, “What would it take to convince you to spare my life?”

He raised his eyebrows, with a small laugh, “Oh, you ain't wastin’ any time! Right out with it!”

“Please answer the question, Huntsman.” I urged him patiently. 

All traces of humor disappeared from his expression as he coolly replied, “Nothing.”

Truthfully, I'd expected as much, but I'd thought at the very least, I could get him to entertain the idea before immediately refusing it. However, I wouldn't let him reduce me to pleading for my life. I was already in a rather undignified position to begin with. I did not need to go lower. 

Funnily enough, I continued to attempt to reason with the unreasonable, “If you kill me, she won't forgive you. And she'll never love you.”

My heart sank when he began to laugh again, “You think that's what this is about, *caoineadh?* Jealousy? Christ, I'm petty, but not *that* fuckin’ petty!”

“So what, then?”

“Now, I *know* you ain't this stupid.” He said, leaning onto the counter. 

This was a wound that had been festering for some time. One that I’d caused him. I spoke the cause of the gangrenous injury's name aloud: “The ledger.” 

The Huntsman clicked his tongue and winked in confirmation. 

Despite knowing it wouldn't do any good, I felt the need to defend my actions, “The game you were playing with the Lady of Orion wasn't a fair one. If I hadn’t stepped in, you would’ve killed her and I couldn’t allow that.”

His voice became colder than the river's depths in the dead of winter. “Wasn't meant to be fair. And wasn’t that just so noble of you! *Selflessly* stickin’ your neck out for her!”

He'd found this particular weakness back in the corn maze and was not shy about exploiting it. 

I hate it. I hate that I did it. I hate that I allowed myself to become one of *them.* Just as opportunistic.

*I just wanted to be free.*

The Huntsman's chuckle gave me the terrible urge to clench my hands into fists, “Aw, don't get all mopey. I ain't one to judge! It's exactly what *I* woulda done, after all.” 

He was distracting me with his barbs. Getting into my head. It took a moment for me to regain my composure, taking in a deep breath before I tried again, “I don't wish to argue with you, Huntsman. I came here to discuss things with civility.” 

He snorted, “Did you, now?”

“I did.” I replied evenly. “Is that something you are capable of?”

“Probably not, but my afternoon is pretty well wide open, so why dontcha go on ahead and try anyway?”

That made me frown. “You might consider a hobby sometime.”

Unfortunately, my retort didn’t have the effect I’d wanted; the intent had been to get under his skin as he does mine. Instead, he found it humorous. “*Woo!* Fiona seems to be rubbin’ off on you! Gotta say, it does make you more interestin’!”

I sighed, feeling far too much like a scholar dealing with a difficult, heckling student. “Will you please take this seriously?”

He raised a hand, still smiling, “Alright, alright! I’ll stop bein’ a dick for a minute.” 

The Huntsman took a deep breath, sobering somewhat. “Come to think of it, there’s one thing you could do to put all o’ this behind you. You get to be a human again. Free to grow old, pay taxes, do whatever the hell you want without me tearin’ your soul apart. But you *really* ain’t gonna like it!”

That wasn’t surprising. In his mind, I’d done something egregious. As such, that gave him the leverage to ask for something equally as diabolical in return. I told him to name his price.

He was all too eager to do so. “Fiona’s name. The real one, this time.”

My eyes widened. Instantly, I protested, “Absolutely not!”

The fiend shrugged, smirking insufferably, “Told ya you wouldn’t like it!”

I wanted to argue that there *must* be something else, but I couldn’t. His sights had been set on Nessa for a while. As of now, I am still unsure if his desires are carnal in nature, or if it more strongly matches the desires of a wolf seeking a doe that has successfully evaded it for far too long. Perhaps even some terrible combination of the two. No matter what his intentions towards Nessa are, it was clear that pleading with him to choose another grueling favor would be fruitless. He wanted *her.*

As shaken as I was, I still dared to ask him a question that had been haunting me for some time: “I truly don’t understand you. Why can't you simply leave her be?” 

He ignored me, “You said some shit earlier ‘bout fairness. You already gave her my name, so that'd even everything out, *caoineadh.*” 

The Huntsman had been dominating our conversation thus far. I couldn't let him continue, so I asked again, “Why not just let her go?”

He sighed, clearly losing patience, “Believe it or not, I don't want this attraction to Fiona anymore than she does. Funny thing is, I didn't have it ‘til she named me. Ya think that's a coincidence?”

That sounded unbelievable to me. He’d appeared to have had a fixation on Nessa before I'd translated the ledger for her, though that seemed more motivated by hunger than by infatuation. However, if he was saying it, at the very least, *he* believed it to be true to the best of his knowledge. 

From what I know about how names can be used to control us, it was possible that by using his against him, Nessa had unintentionally bound him to her. The threat of having him permanently tied to me in the way that he is bound to her is why I've refrained from doing the same. Perhaps that was why his affections towards Nessa were still edged with hostility. 

“What if I helped you get rid of the attraction instead?” I offered. “That's what you truly want, isn't it?”

“What do ya think I'm-” The Huntsman cut himself off, his eyes suddenly narrowing at the door behind me. “Hold that thought.”

Abruptly, he turned and disappeared into the back of his shop. Before I could question him, I heard a car door slam shut from outside. Another customer? Sadly, not. When I peered through the nearest window, I was greeted by the unwelcome sight of another Huntsman approaching. 

This one was unfamiliar to me. With his stature and the stern expression on his face, he reminded me of a bear. I recall dreading seeing him. Dreading the appearance of yet another Huntsman to bring grief to an already grief-stricken region. 

However, the problem ended up taking care of itself. Though, I suppose it would be more accurate to say that our usual problem took care of it instead.

The bear flounced through the door, not paying me even a passing glance. Without looking back at it, he then reached behind him, surreptitiously turning the lock into place. I didn’t dare move, staying still to avoid his notice. 

Not long after, the captain of the Wild Hunt reemerged from the back room, casually holding a tire iron in a gloved hand, cheerfully greeting the huge Hunter, “Howdy!”

Equally as amicable, the bear returned it, “Hello!”

There was the glint of a knife in the bear's hand. The violence between them was so sudden and unexpected that it made me yelp as I backpedaled, momentarily forgetting about the hagstone's protection in my fright. 

With one massive hand, the bear had shoved the Huntsman back into one of the vehicles he'd been working on, the impact creating a dent in its front. The Dragonfly moved just as the knife was driven down into the hood, right where his head had been. Afterwards, there was an awful thud as the tire iron left a perfect imprint on the side of the bear's head. Contact with the poisonous metal briefly caused the bear's disguise to falter, revealing an even more imposing horned figure concealed beneath the veil. 

Not wanting to be around for any more of this brutality - especially because our discussion had been going nowhere - I crept towards the door. The Huntsman caught me, shouting as he wrapped his forearm around the bear's throat, pressing down hard enough to make his opponent's face turn purple, “We ain't done here! You stay *right* where you are!”

The veins in the bear's face and neck were bulging as his elbow battered the Huntsman's ribs. The Dragonfly’s grip faltered for just long enough for the bear to break free. Their movements became a blur after that.

After he'd snapped at me, I was afraid to leave, not just out of concern for my own well-being, but Nessa's. I wouldn't put it past him to transfer any anger I awakened in him onto her, given how volatile he could be. She didn’t need that.

Unsure of what to do with myself in the meantime, I uncomfortably glanced around, seeking something to read to distract myself from the brawl. Naturally, there was nothing save for some brochures on full-synthetic oil. Meanwhile, it sounded like a natural disaster was occurring in that back room, between the metallic clanks of their weapons and the ear-splitting crashes that would reverberate throughout the shop whenever one of them would attempt to overpower the other. 

Truth be told, such violence makes me sick. One would think that after vicariously experiencing so much of it in my visions that I would be desensitized to it. That is not the case. If anything, it has only increased my aversion. 

Eventually, I heard a howl. It didn't come from the Dragonfly. There were a series of horrific, muffled thuds after that; the grotesque sound of meat being tenderized. Then silence. 

When the Huntsman stalked back out, both he and the tire iron were covered in blood. 

“I appreciate your patience,” He said breathlessly, wrapping the tool in a grease-covered towel that looked as if it could've been yellow at one point. 

I struggled to find words after the chaos that had just transpired. As he used a roll of paper towels to wipe the blood off of his face and arms, I warily - and with some trepidation - asked, “What was that about?”

“Hm? Oh, *him.*” What else would I have been referring to? “Yeah, that happens from time to time. I'm guessin’ he saw the state I was in after Samhain and thought he had a shot at a promotion.”

They truly are barbaric. There is a guilty part of me that wishes that the bear had won. But alas, the Dragonfly retains his position. 

He tossed the used paper towel towards the refuse bin, frowning when it bounced off the side, the reddened ball rolling a few centimeters along the floor next to it. With a sigh, he picked it up and placed it where it belonged. 

“Anyways,” The Huntsman began, leaning with his lower back pressed against the counter, then folding his arms across his chest. “Fiona’s real name.”

“I do not know it,” I informed him firmly. “And even if I did, I would not share it with anyone else like us, you especially.”

He chuckled harshly, shaking his head as he tilted his chin up towards the ceiling, “*Us?* You ain't one of us, *caoineadh!* Not really.” 

Before I could say another word, his voice and stare froze me in place as he continued, “You weren’t there when they came in droves, razin’ our forests to forge their iron weapons. You weren’t there when they cut our wings off as trophies, or when they strung my brothers’ and sisters’ bodies up on trees. You weren’t there when we lost *everything.* You *ain't* one of us.”

Swallowing, I summoned the audacity to point out, “And now you're attracted to one of them.” 

His laughter was bitter, “Yeah. Fuckin’ joke, isn't it?”

After gathering some more bravery, I presented him with my earlier offer once again, “If I find some way to help you dispel the attraction, will you allow me to live once the river releases me?” 

All traces of humor had drained from his demeanor, “I ain't negotiatin’ with ya. You wanna live so badly? Find me her name.”

“Please, be reasonable-”

“I *am* bein’ reasonable.” He interrupted calmly. “Now, I'll admit that I shouldn't've underestimated her and made that bet in the first place. That’s on me. However, if ya hadn't translated that ledger, I'd've made a fuckin’ buffet out of her and her colleagues' a while ago. Come on, *caoineadh,* you had to know this was comin'!”

“I did,” I conceded. “From the beginning, I was aware that there would be repercussions to aiding her. But you said yourself that the Lady of Orion is worth the trouble. I'm inclined to agree with you.”

“Yeah, she is some trouble, ain't she?” Despite professing his resentment about what he believed to be a manufactured attraction towards Nessa, he sounded as if he were fond of her when he said this.  

At the risk of agitating him again, I gave my honest thoughts in the hope that it could eventually lead to some resolution, “Given what you told me earlier about your history, I can imagine that it's easier to believe that your desires towards Nessa stem solely from having your name taken. However, I can’t help but wonder if there’s a bit more to it that you haven’t acknowledged.”

His eyes slitted, though his smirk remained as he playfully asked, “You tryin’ to psychoanalyze me, *caoineadh*?”

“Not at all,” I insisted evenly. “I'm merely telling you what I see. And what I see is someone who would rather convince himself that he is being manipulated rather than enamored.”

He shrugged, “Well, sounds like you best get your eyes checked. Now, are you gonna get me that name or are you gonna continue to waste my time? I got a body to dispose of.”

Maintaining my guise of patience, I took a deep breath then explained, “The point I'm trying to make is that learning her name won't stop the attraction, neither will eliminating me. All you'll serve to do by pursuing either option is ensure that your infatuation will remain unrequited. The best thing you can do for yourself and for Nessa is to let her go. Let *us* go.”

He pursed his lips in a pantomime of consideration, though I could tell that his mind was already made up. It had been made for a long time and it wasn't about to change.  

Eyes on the ground, demeanor light, he questioned, “Can I ask you somethin’, *caoineadh?*”

Hesitantly, I told him he could. A naïve little part of me wondered if agreeability would encourage him to find some semblance of mercy in his black heart. 

He snickered as he asked, “Just between you and me, do you actually care about Fiona? Or do you just care 'bout what she can do for you?”

Naïve, indeed. I should've known better. I *did* know better. The only thing something like him can understand is cruelty. 

I shook my head in disbelief at what he was accusing me of, “I'm not like you, Huntsman. I don't see people as a means to an end.”

“That ain't an answer.” He taunted. 

Despite knowing that I didn't have to justify myself to the being that has repeatedly assaulted Nessa in every way that he could - beating her, forcing himself on her, manipulating her - the implication that I was using her as he would made my blood boil. 

“Not that it matters to you, Huntsman, but I *do* care. And even if I'm not here to see it, I know that she *will* be free of you some day. They all will be. You talk about the repercussions of *my* actions? What about yours! You've been a terror for centuries by your own admission! You and yours are a blight upon this world!”

“So it's the latter.” His response made me reconsider my stance on violence. 

Trying to defend myself had been a mistake. No matter what I said, he would twist my words to make me out to be as villainous as he is. 

“Believe what you want, Huntsman.” I uttered in resignation. “I'll leave you to tend to your… guest.”

As I departed in what I hoped appeared to be a level-headed manner, he mockingly told me that if I changed my mind on betraying Nessa, I knew where to find him. 

Going there had been foolish. Clearly, trying to discuss things like civilized people was beyond the Huntsman's capabilities. To be clear, I'd known from the beginning that my involvement in saving Nessa’s life wouldn't be without its consequences. However, he had surprised me before by aiding her and her colleagues with the hag. There was a small, stupid part of me that had been hoping he'd surprise me again. 

There has to be another way. I will neither give up on my life nor my freedom, though I refuse to betray the woman I care about to obtain either one. 

As I've noted before, I am selfish. And at this moment, my most selfish desire is that she would've let him die.

Even after describing my situation and reexamining my abysmal interaction with the Huntsman, I still don't have a perfect solution. I’ll outline the possibilities I’ve already visited so that I don’t linger on them any longer.

Leaving after severing my tie to the river is not an option. Running from a Huntsman is ill-advised to begin with, but with the grudge he has against me, there isn't a doubt in my mind that he'd hunt me to the ends of the earth. 

There’s the possibility that another Hunter could take advantage of his injuries just as the bear had attempted to. With any luck, one of them will usurp him just as he did the captain that controlled this region before. However, he has proven himself to be formidable, even in weakness. There is also that possibility that his hypothetical replacement could be worse. 

When Nessa came home from work, she informed me that the employee who uses the false name, Cerri, had submitted her two weeks’ notice. After the events of Samhain, it is completely understandable. The Hunters didn’t appear to have as much interest in her as the others, so they’re praying that she’ll be able to make a clean break once her time is up.

That gave me an idea. 

Judging by her reaction, I apparently caught her off guard when I asked, “What were the exact terms you set in your bet with the mechanic? About his potential claims on Orion employees?”

Her brow furrowed as she tried to recall the exact words that they’d exchanged, “Uh… If I found his name, he had to relinquish his claim on all employees, regardless if they were living, dead, or undead. Why?”

“Does that apply only to those employed during the time of the deal, or does that extend to those brought on afterwards?”

She frowned, “Come to think of it, we didn’t specify. In hindsight, we should have.”

The Huntsman would probably point that out as well. It truly is a shame that one has to be both ruthless and cunning.

“Why?” Nessa asked, throwing herself onto the couch next to me. “Are you worried the Hunters will look for Cerri?”

Terribly enough, I had been so focused on my own situation that I hadn’t considered the threat to her colleague. But now that she’d mentioned it, I was concerned. 

“That is a frightening prospect,” I said, not wanting to admit my self-absorption. “I also need you to know that I spoke to him today.”

She gave me an incredulous look, “Wait, you *spoke* to the mechanic? Willingly?”

After I apologized for my secrecy, I relayed the entire experience to her. She wasn’t happy that I’d gone without warning her beforehand, which I accepted. I should have told her what my intentions were. As I showed her the recollection above, she snickered when I confessed to telling him to get a hobby, but otherwise her face was grave as she read my account of events, especially when I described the challenge from that other Hunter. 

“But to be clear, you did specify *all* Orion employees, did you not?” I inquired after she was done.

She nodded, “Yeah, we did.”

“Then we might be able to argue that ‘all’ includes current and previous employees. As long as there is an employment history, Cerri should fall under that protection. The same should go for any others that your supervisor recruits afterwards.”

Her pale eyebrows rose. “Huh. I… think you might be right. Of course, that’s only protection from the mechanic, but that’s better than nothing, right?”

I nodded, “It is! But in truth, that isn’t the sole reason why I brought the subject up.”

That was when I asked if there was any possibility that her employer would consider hiring me. A glimmer of recognition made her gloriously dark eyes shine like a starlit night. Without another word, she called the leader of Orion.

When he answered, it sounded as if he’d just awoken, or that he’d rather be doing anything but speaking to someone else. From what little I know about the draugr, both possibilities were equally viable.

Nessa didn’t help matters. Her way of beginning this conversation was, “Hey, you wanna hire my girlfriend?”

I failed to consider that she has made annoying him into an art form. I put my face in my hands to hide from her impish grin, not wanting my laughter to be audible over the phone. 

There was a loud, heavy sigh from the other end of the line, followed by an exhausted, “What?”

“Okay, hear me out!” She said, “First of all, she’s a genius-”

Flustered and giggling like an idiot, I whispered, “*Will you stop?!*”

Nessa carried on as if I hadn’t said anything, “She is a genius that figured out that as long as someone is or was employed at Orion, the mechanic can’t eat their souls! Not to mention that she has been extremely valuable to our organization, such as finding all those hagstones for us. Honestly, she should’ve been on our payroll a long time ago and you’ve been benefiting from free labor, buster!”

Even though I couldn’t feel it, I was certain that I had to be blushing. When I glanced in the mirror hanging at the end of the hall, I discovered that I was right.

Victor replied, “Splendid! She can take your spot!”

“Even if you fired me, I’d just show up anyway! And with a lawsuit, since you’re making us work for free.”


With another heavy sigh, her supervisor asked, “Can I talk to her? *Instead* of you?”

Instantly, I became nervous as she readily handed me the phone. With a shaky exhale, I accepted it, taking it off of the loudspeaker option in case the draugr wanted privacy.

Since I wasn’t as familiar with him as my beloved is, I felt the need to be polite, “Good evening.”

“Sometimes, I forget how nice it is to speak to another grown-up.” He joked, thankfully sounding less irritated with me than he had with Nessa. 

After a swallow, I explained to him all of the intricacies of my situation. About the premonition of my own death, leaving out the details of this vision that continued to haunt me. My ribs breaking as the Huntsman reached into my chest as he had before, but without the river’s numbness to spare me from the pain this time. The firm coil of his hand around my heart mere seconds before arteries tore, stretching to the point of snapping as he took his time ripping my heart out. Darkness swallowed me even before I felt the tip of his finger burrow into the tear duct of my right eye. 

I shook off the memory, going on to say, “Because of the verbiage of Nessa’s deal with the one you refer to as ‘the mechanic,’ I have reason to believe that the only way that I can survive after escaping from the river is by using the protection that Orion has been granted by naming him.”

The owner of Orion sounded somewhat apprehensive, “There are some concerns I have, the first being that the deal was only about employees’ souls. He'd still be able to take your life, if the opportunity presented itself. Unfortunately, the fucker is smart, so that won't escape his notice. He could also enlist either Briar or the Houndmaster to do the job for him, since the deal only applies to the mechanic.”

The leader of Orion was right to point all of this out. But even so, “It's not complete protection, but it's more than what I have now.”

“That's true,” He agreed. “And you're aware that you'll have to handle iron and salt?”

“Once I’m human again, neither of those will be an issue.” I assured him. 

He was quiet for a moment as he considered. I held my breath in anticipation. 

Eventually, he said, “Well, I suppose we do owe you for all that you’ve done for us.”

Nessa seemed pleased to hear that come Monday, I will be joining the Orion crew. The plan is for me to complete my onboarding before I end my servitude to the river. This way, we can ensure that the Huntsman can't reach me before Orion's protection is in effect. 

She also said that she wants to gauge the Huntsman's reaction to the news of my hiring. Her thinking is that a negative response will indicate if we're on the right track or not. As much as it pains me to acknowledge it, she appears to have gotten to know the Huntsman fairly well. Well enough to see through him better than she had probably ever wanted to.  

On another note… Nessa has asked if she can publish my account of events, provided that I'm comfortable with it. Admittedly, I'm nervous to have my private thoughts put before the eyes of strangers, but in the end, it might not be a terrible idea to have a few more sets of eyes to look over our circumstances. It's entirely possible that there is something we are missing that someone else could [see](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/kvnRWF2wFv).

NoSleep,"We searched for NYC’s Sewer People for a YouTube video. I wish I would've stayed above ground.
","When my best friend Cal and I started the channel, it was just for fun. Urban exploring in New York City had been our thing for years, and YouTube was just a way to share it. Abandoned buildings, forgotten hotels, that was our brand. But as our channel grew, so did the demands of our audience. They wanted the extreme, the more hidden parts of NYC.

It was Cal’s idea to investigate the “Sewer People” rumor.

“Think about it, man,” he said one night, eyes gleaming. “A whole network of people living under the city. If we’re the first to get that on camera? We’ll blow up.”

I couldn’t deny the appeal. Rumors had circulated for decades about the shadowy figures who lurked below New York, scavenging, surviving off rats and whatever the city discarded. But, like most urban legends, I assumed the stories were exaggerated.

Cal and I spent hours prepping for the sewer dive, making sure we had everything we’d need to face whatever was down there. We packed our bags with essentials: extra water, enough to last us for hours, and spare batteries for the flashlights, since darkness would be our worst enemy. I grabbed a few granola bars too, just in case we got stuck down there longer than planned. To keep any sewer pests at bay, we duct-taped our pant legs and sleeves, sealing off every gap to make sure nothing small and unwelcome could find its way in.

With our gear packed and GoPros ready, we made our way to a manhole cover in a quiet corner of the city. Cal pried it open, the metal scraping against concrete with an echoing screech, and we peered down into the black void below. The stench hit us first, a mix of mold and filth. Cal shot me a quick look, a mix of excitement and nervousness on his face. “Well, I guess this is it” he said before turning on his GoPro. He shot me a grin before he head down first, his flashlight beam slicing into the darkness.

One rung at a time, I followed him, my hands gripping the rusty metal as we descended into the underbelly of the city. The sounds of the street above faded with each step, replaced by the steady movement of water echoing around us and the hum of distant machinery. When our feet hit the wet concrete below, we stood there in the dim beam of our flashlights, our eyes adjusting to the darkness. The walls were slick with grime and patches of mildew growing along the cracked cement. Somewhere in the dark, we heard a faint scuttle, the unmistakable skitter of rats just out of sight.

Among the gear, I’d packed several rolls of reflective tape. In these dark, winding tunnels, getting turned around would be all too easy, and the last thing we wanted was to get lost down here. Every few yards, I peeled off a strip and slapped it on the wall, watching as it shined in the beam of our flashlights like a tiny beacon marking our way back. It felt reassuring, each piece of tape reflecting back to us, a reminder that we had a trail back to the exit, no matter how far in we ventured.

 For a while, this routine was all we had, exploring the narrow tunnels, stepping around filth and cockroaches, chatting to our cameras, cracking jokes to mask the tension. We spoke in low voices, our words bouncing off the walls and echoing down the tunnels. Every so often we’d hear scuttering, and faint splashes of water, but nothing more. No signs of human life, no movement. I started to wonder if the stories about the “sewer people” were just nothing more than rumors. I told Cal as much.

“I gotta say man, I’m starting to think the stuff about sewer people is just bullshit”.

“Yeah, you’re probably right. We’ll push a little further, then we’ll head back” Cal replied.

We kept pushing further.

The smell had been bad from the start, but now it was clawing its way into my head, thick and unrelenting. Every breath felt like I was swallowing damp rot mixed with decay, the odor sinking into my lungs. My stomach starting to twist and churn. I gagged, pulling my shirt up over my nose in a useless attempt to filter the air, but it barely helped. The feeling of nausea and claustrophobia began to take hold of me.

I glanced at Cal, who seemed focused, oblivious to my growing panic. I started to feel like the walls of the sewer were inching closer, getting tighter around us. My chest tightened, breaths coming shallower, and the concrete felt like it was pressing down on me. We were far away from our exit now, from fresh air, from daylight, and the reality of how deep we ventured hit me.

I wanted to turn around, to trace our way back to the manhole and climb out into the open air. I forced myself to take another breath, hoping it would steady me, but all it did was fill my lungs with that choking, nauseating stench.

“Cal, I think it’s time we get the hell out of here” I said.

Cal paused a moment, considering what I had said. I knew he was fumbling inside his brain, trying to decide if we had gotten enough footage for a video. “Alright… alright… yeah… let’s go” he finally replied.

Just as we were about to turn back, I felt something crunch beneath my boot. A sharp, brittle sound that sent a shiver up my spine. I froze, the weight of my foot still pressing down on whatever I'd just stepped on.

“Ah gross, what the hell…” I muttered, lifting my foot carefully and instinctively shining my flashlight downward.

The beam caught it instantly, casting a light on a line of severed rat heads stretched out across the floor in front of us. Each one was cleanly cut, like they’d been sliced off with a blade, neat and precise, the way a cook might prepare a fresh chicken. Their dead eyes stared up blankly, fur still glistening with damp, while rows of teeth that gaped out of tiny mouths in frozen agony. And there were dozens of them, arranged in a long trail leading deeper into the sewer, like some type of twisted bread trail.

Cal’s light joined mine, and I heard his sharp intake of breath as he took in the scene.

We both stood there, speechless. A faint smell of something else joined us, a dead smell, something like sulfur.

I felt my pulse quicken, a wave of nausea rising in my throat as I stared at the trail of severed heads. My mind screamed at me to turn back, to get out of here before whatever had left this realized we were here. It felt like something we weren’t supposed to see.

“We need to leave, man,” I said, my voice coming out quieter than I meant. I glanced over at Cal, but he was still focused on the trail of rat heads, his flashlight sweeping back and forth. “We’ve seen enough. No video is worth all this.”

Cal didn’t respond right away. He just kept looking at the heads. Then, finally, he turned to me, his eyes intense. “No, we need to go further,” he said, his voice steady but with a fire beneath it. “This is exactly why we’re here. This isn’t just some random mess. Whatever did this, they cut these off clean. A person did this.”

I felt a cold pit form in my stomach. I didn’t want to know who, or what, would do that.

“Cal, that’s... that’s insane. People don’t just—” I cut myself off, my words getting tangled. “We’re in over our heads here man. We don’t need the video that bad.”

But Cal was already shaking his head, his eyes wide, his excitement slowly turning to obsession. “No, we do need to find it. Think about it. We actually found something, right? This is what we came for. We’ve been talking about this for months, and now we have proof, man. This is the real deal.”

I opened my mouth to argue, but Cal was already moving, stepping forward.

I hesitated. Every nerve in my body screamed at me to stop him, to pull him back, but I couldn’t. Something about his conviction pulled me in, even though every instinct was telling me to run the hell out of there. I paused for a moment, before following him further into the sewers.

As we ventured deeper into the tunnels, I couldn’t help but notice the appearance of the sewer began to change. The smell, while still overwhelmingly foul, had begun to change in subtle ways; less stagnant. The walls, which had been slick with grime and mildew just moments before, began to appear oddly cleaner. The thick layers of mold were replaced with smooth concrete. It looked as though this area of the sewer was more maintained than the rest of it.

I glanced at Cal, wondering if he was noticing it too. He didn’t say anything, but I saw the way his flashlight flicked over the walls, a growing unease creeping into his expression. We were no longer in the decaying, forgotten part of the sewer system, but in some other area, one that looked cared for and used.

The tunnels felt more structured now, the path straightening, and the walls narrowing just slightly, giving the whole space a more controlled, less abandoned feel. It was unsettling in a way I couldn’t explain.

We kept moving, drawn by the hope of capturing something for the video, but I felt my nerves increasing with every step. The rats had all but disappeared also, like even they knew to avoid this area.

The deeper we went, I started to notice something. At first, it was so faint that I thought I might’ve imagined it. It was a low, rumbling sound, like the hum of machinery, a deep growl vibrating through the walls. I stopped in my tracks, holding up a hand to signal to Cal.

He turned, raising his flashlight in my direction. I could see the question in his eyes before he spoke.

“You hear that?”

I nodded. “Yeah. What the hell is that?”

We stood there for a moment, listening. The sound was still distant, but it was undeniable now, a persistent, low roar. My heart started to pick up pace.

""Let's keep going,"" Cal said, his voice tinged with excitement. ""I think we're getting close to something.""

I hesitated, but Cal had already started moving forward again. Against my better judgment, I followed him. As we pressed on, the sound grew louder, and we realized something unsettling.

It wasn’t a roar at all. It was voices. A low murmur, like a chorus, layered and overlapping. Dozens, maybe hundreds, all blending together in a constant, unintelligible hum.

The closer we got, the more it became like a crowd, the way a school lunchroom sounds when you’re standing in the hallway. Chatter, laughter, some raised voices, all of it happening at once.

I shivered involuntarily. This wasn’t what I’d expected to find when we started this. I didn't know what I expected to find down here but it was not this.

Cal’s eyes darted around, scanning the walls and the tunnel ahead. Curiosity. Obsession. I could see it in him, a hunger to know what was just beyond that next bend.

And I couldn’t deny it, I was just as desperate to know. I felt my pulse race, as if we were on the verge of discovering something huge, something we were never supposed to find.

We pushed forward, each step in sync now as we approached the source of the noise. The voices grew clearer, louder, and yet, still completely unintelligible, a garbled blend of human sounds.

""Stay close,"" I murmured, the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end.

We rounded a corner, and the source of the noise came into view.

I froze. My flashlight flickered in the dim light, and I nearly dropped it. We had entered a massive clearing in the middle of the sewer system. It was like some kind of underground hub, a junction. A place where several tunnels converged, creating a central location. There were dozens, no... hundreds of people.

They were dirty. Grime was smeared on their skin, their clothes ragged, some in nothing more than tattered scraps of fabric, others in what looked like makeshift clothes, pieced together from whatever they could find in the tunnels. Some had bandages wrapped around their arms and heads, others limped as they shuffled around the clearing. They looked… wrong. Hunched, disjointed, their limbs moved with jerky, unnatural motions like they didn’t fully understand how to walk properly anymore. Their faces were obscured by the shadows, but I could see the glint of eyes, eyes that were too wide, too bright, like they had been adapted to the darkness. We didn’t belong here, no normal person does.

They muttered, grunted to each other, their speech broken and garbled. The few words that escaped their lips sounded like a twisted form of English, nothing coherent, just guttural sounds.

I felt a chill crawl up my spine as I took in the scene. This was wrong. These weren’t homeless people or squatters living down here, they were something else. Something more.

Then, my eyes locked on something that made my breath catch. At the center of the clearing, standing on a raised platform made of old, broken concrete, was the leader.

The man, if he could even be called that, was tall, or had been at some point. Now, his posture was crooked, hunched over like a vulture. He wore a crown, something pieced together from what I assumed were rat bones, broken shards of glass, and bits of trash from the sewer. It looked grotesque. A twisted mockery of something royal. The crown was perched unevenly on his black, oily, matted hair. But I could see the glint of his eyes as he surveyed the crowd, his expression calm, like he was the ruler of this entire underground kingdom.

It was all so surreal. These people, if they could even be called that anymore, were standing in this cavernous space. In the center, they surrounding a pile. A massive pile, of rats. Hundreds of them. Maybe more. They were piled high in the center, with the leader overseeing the rat feast like some kind of grotesque ritual.

“Jesus Christ… it’s real” I heard Cal mutter beside me. He wasn’t even trying to hide the awe in his voice.

I could feel the fear crawling up my spine now, the air pressing down on me like a weight. This was no longer just some urban legend. This was real, and we were standing in the middle of it.

As I stood frozen in place, trying to process what I was seeing, a new sound pierced through the murmur of voices. A low, distant shuffling at first, but then it grew louder, from behind us.

I turned, my heart leaping in my chest. Figures were emerging from the dark tunnels behind us, their silhouettes barely visible. At first, there were just a few, but then it turned into a flood, dozens of these people, stumbling toward the center of the clearing.

They were coming from all directions, like ants pouring out of their hills, drawn by some instinctual need. They moved with urgency, with purpose, but at the same time, there was a strange disjointedness to their movements. Some of them shuffled, some of them crawled, and others just seemed to drag their limbs along like they hadn’t walked in years.

The stench grew stronger as they piled in. The rancid, sour smell of bodies and decay thickened in the air, mixing with the overpowering scent of rats. I could feel it choking me, making me gag as my stomach heaved.

As the bodies poured in from behind us, the next thing I knew, we were being shoved forward, pushed into the heart of the crowd. The smell was suffocating now, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as the noise grew louder, the voices of the sewer people mingling with a chorus of strange, guttural sounds that made my skin crawl.

We weren’t just watching anymore; we were now standing in the crowd. We had joined it.

“Shit!” I gasped, my feet stumbling as I was pushed further into the group. I felt hands brush against my arms, cold and clammy.

I tried to push back, to fight my way free, but the crowd was too strong, too dense. My flashlight bounced wildly in my hand as I was shoved again, deeper into the center of the clearing. People, things, limbs, were bumping against me, pressing in from all sides, their skin slick and cold with grime. I could hear their breath, heavy and labored, and the low guttural muttering as they moved past us.

And then I saw it. The leader, standing on his makeshift platform, staring down at the chaos unfolding below. The glass and jagged rat bones in his crown seemed to gleam in the dim light. He raised his hand slowly, and in that moment, the entire crowd fell silent.

I didn’t know what it meant, but I knew it wasn’t good. I could feel my chest tightening, my breath coming in shallow gasps as I looked around. The people were all staring now, some with wide, hungry eyes.

The King, as I started to think of him, raised his hand again, a slow, deliberate motion that commanded the crowd. His eyes flicked from person to person, and as if on cue, the crowd began to shuffle forward, toward the massive pile of rats in the center of the clearing. One by one, people stepped forward, bent down, and grabbed rats from the pile. They didn’t hesitate, their hands trembling as they selected their prize, some ripping the poor creatures free from the heap like they were choosing cuts of meat at a butcher’s stall. Then they turned and retreated back to the edges of the clearing, crouching down to wait patiently.

A sick realization hit me like a punch to the gut. This was some kind of feast.

My heart raced as the crowd shifted, pushing me closer to the rats. I looked over at Cal, but his expression was distant, his face flushed with something I couldn’t place. His eyes were fixed on the rats.

I felt the crowd pushing me forward, and before I could even think about what I was doing, I was right there, standing at the edge of the pile. The rats were piled high, some of them twitching, others limp, their bodies cold and stiff. The scent of death hung thick in the air, a noxious mix of decay and rot that clung to the back of my throat. I didn’t dare breathe too deeply. Not now.

I glanced around at the others, at the people who had already taken their rats, and saw that no one was looking at me, no one was paying attention. The last thing I wanted was to be discovered as an outsider, someone who didn’t belong. I couldn’t risk it.

So, with shaking hands, I bent down and grabbed a rat. It was cold and stiff beneath my fingers, its fur matted and slick with filth. The weight of it was almost comical at first, like I was holding something that didn’t belong in my hands. But I held onto it tightly, trying to ignore the disgust that bubbled up in my throat.

Up close, the pile of rats was even more massive than I thought, it was a huge, mountainous pile. There were thousands of them, more than I could ever count. Their eyes were wide open, frozen in a permanent state of terror, their little bodies twisted and mangled. I felt a shiver crawl up my spine as I imagined the horror of whatever had made them like this.

But the people around me were all so calm, so unbothered by it. It was as if this was just... normal. I could feel the tension building inside me, but I gritted my teeth and held onto the rat, walking slowly, head down, back toward the edges of the crowd, just like the others had done.

I couldn’t let anyone know. I couldn’t let them see that I was different, that I was scared, that I didn’t belong here. I swallowed hard and forced my legs to move, my body stiff and rigid as I made my way through the crowd.

The moment felt endless. Every step felt like a violation. I could feel the eyes of the sewer people on me, could sense their gaze following me as I walked past, the oppressive weight of their attention pressing down on me. But I didn’t look up. I kept my eyes fixed straight ahead, my hand clenching around the rat, my mind begging me to run.

When I reached the edge of the crowd, I crouched down, just like everyone else. I sat on the cold, damp floor, holding the rat in my lap, my hands shaking as I tried to force myself to calm down.

But I couldn’t. I couldn’t stop the panic from creeping in, couldn’t stop my mind from screaming that I was in too deep, that I was surrounded by people who were no longer human. And yet, I had just done the same thing they had, picked a rat from the pile, just like them.

I knew that something was about to happen. Something horrible. Something I wasn’t ready for.

But I had no choice but to wait. I sat there in the filthy, rat-infested sewer, surrounded by hundreds of people who were no longer people. I hoped that this rat wasn't going to be the last thing I ever saw.

Then, with a guttural, broken voice that seemed to scrape against the very air itself, the King bellowed, “EEEEAT!”

The sound that followed was like nothing I’d ever heard before, like the gnashing of wild animals tearing at fresh meat, the sound of skin being shredded and bones cracking under the weight of savage hunger. The crowd erupted in a frenzy. The rats, still limp in their hands, were immediately ripped open. Flesh was torn away in great, savage chunks, and fur flew everywhere in the dim, flickering light of the flashlights. The guttural sounds of gnawing and tearing filled the air, mingling with the sickeningly wet squelch of flesh being ripped apart.

I couldn’t tear my eyes away, even though I wanted to, even though every part of me screamed to run. But my legs refused to move, and my body was frozen, paralyzed with both fear and disgust.

I tried to block out the sounds, the images, tried to convince myself it wasn’t real. But no matter how tightly I shut my eyes, the sounds wouldn’t stop.

And then, through my blurred vision, through the tears that blurred my sight, I saw him. A man kneeling beside me, staring directly at me with an unblinking, curious look in his eyes. His face was covered in grime, his teeth stained with dark red, but it was the expression in his eyes that froze me. It wasn’t hunger. It wasn’t madness. It was curiosity.

A chill ran down my spine. I knew then, he was studying me, trying to figure out if I was one of them, if I was part of the feast. The realization hit me like a blow to the gut. My heart started pounding, and I felt my breath catch in my throat. I had no choice. I had to blend in. I had to eat.

I hesitated, if I faltered for even a second, I knew I’d be exposed.

I couldn’t risk it.

Without thinking, without even acknowledging what I was doing, I leaned down and brought the rat up to my mouth. The scent of decay hit me first, the stench of rot, of death. I almost gagged at the thought of it, but I pushed it down, forced myself to swallow my pride and my fear.

I tore into the rat.

The meat was cold and rubbery, its flesh stringy and tough. My teeth sunk into it, but the texture was wrong, so wrong. I could taste the filth in the rat’s skin, the decay that clung to its bones. My stomach lurched, but I forced myself to swallow, to pretend that it didn’t make me sick.

I could feel his eyes on me. The man beside me, still watching, as if waiting for me to flinch, to break, to betray myself. I couldn’t let him see it. I couldn’t let anyone see it.

I kept chewing, even though I wanted to vomit, even though I wanted to scream. The crowd around me was consumed by their own feeding frenzy, ripping, tearing, devouring the rats with an almost animalistic fervor. The sound of gnashing teeth and guttural growls filled the air, drowning out everything else.

When I glanced back toward the man, he wasn’t watching me anymore. He was tearing into his own rat. I knew I had done it; I had succeeded.

With everyone preoccupied with their meal, I decided now was my chance to escape. Crouching low, I made my way through the crowd, toward the tunnel which we had come.

I tried to find Cal in the crowd, but he was no where to be seen. In a moment of internal conflict, I tried to decide whether to stay and look for him, or whether to leave.

*Cal must’ve left already. He’s probably already halfway back to the surface.* I convinced myself.

I tried to reassure myself of this, but it did little to calm the growing panic in my chest. Still, I knew I couldn’t stay. If I waited too long, if I kept looking for him, I’d draw attention to myself. I had no choice.

With a deep breath, I turned away from the crowd, my legs barely holding me as I crept back toward the tunnel. My heart raced, pounding in my ears, almost louder than the cacophony of noise behind me. Every step felt like it could be my last, but I didn’t stop.

I moved swiftly, but as quietly as possible, my hands shaking as I gripped my flashlight. The stench of decay still clung to the air, mixing with the sickly, metallic tang of blood.

I could hear them behind me, voices, grunts, the sound of tearing, gnashing teeth, but none of it mattered now. The only thing that mattered was getting back to the surface.

I didn’t look back. I couldn’t afford to.

But in the back of my mind, that question still echoed. *Where was Cal?*

Relief started to creep in as soon as I saw the familiar, grimy walls of the tunnel again. My flashlight cast weak beams of light on the wet surface, and for a brief moment, it felt like I was back in the world I knew, safe. I moved faster now, the echo of my footsteps ringing in the silence of the tunnel. The overwhelming stench of the rats, the blood, and the decay was fading with every step I took away from the nightmare.

I focused on the tape, the reflective strips I’d laid down earlier, each piece glinting faintly as I passed. The orange markings were a lifeline, a trail leading me back to the surface. My legs ached, but the relief of being out of that hellish clearing, the noise of the feast growing more distant with each step, made my pulse steady a little.

Just then, passing by an intersection of tunnels, my flashlight cut through the shadows, illuminating something… *someone*. 

I stopped dead in my tracks.

It was one of them. A child. A God damn sewer child. They were alone. Their eyes were wide, bloodshot, their skin pale and filthy, the same ragged clothes as the others.

We stood there staring at each other for what felt like an eternity. They didn’t move, and neither did I. My brain screamed at me to run, but my legs felt like they were frozen in place. For a split second, the world seemed to hold its breath.

In an instant, their eyes widened, their lips curling into something resembling a hiss. Without a word, without hesitation, they bolted, rushing past me with surprising speed. I stood frozen for a moment, the weight of the realization crashing over me: they were running back to the clearing, to alert the others. Panic surged through me, and in that split second, I turned and ran, heart pounding in my ears.

My lungs were on fire, each breath coming in sharp, desperate gasps. My legs felt like they were made of stone, but I didn’t stop running. The tape whizzed by, just a blur of orange as I sped past it, barely able to keep track of where I was.

Finally, I saw the ladder. My heart skipped a beat. The rungs were barely visible in the faint light, but I could make them out just enough. I shoved myself toward it, my hands trembling as I grabbed hold, yanking myself upward. The manhole cover was still off. I could see daylight streaming through the opening, the outside world, and safety, was just a few feet away.

I didn’t hesitate. My hands scrambled for the ladder as I hauled myself up, every muscle in my body screaming, but I didn’t care. Freedom was right there, just above me. I pushed, harder and harder, until the light hit my face, and I crawled out into the daylight, gasping for air, my heart still pounding in my chest.

The first thing I did when I stumbled out into the light was vomit. It hit me all at once, violent and uncontrollable. My stomach twisted, and before I could even catch my breath, the black, disgusting bile came up. It wasn’t just any vomit, it was thick, putrid, and oily, like something from a nightmare. My body convulsed, and I couldn’t stop it. The rat I had eaten, the taste, the texture, the sickening act of it, came rushing back. I threw up everywhere, all over the ground, the reek of rot and bile filling the air. I barely had time to brace myself before it came again. It was like my insides were churning as if they wanted to escape my body entirely. The horror of what I'd just done, what I'd been forced to do, felt like it was coming out of me in waves.

I looked around, hoping, praying that Cal managed to make it out before me. But there was no sign of him. I waited outside the manhole for hours, pacing back and forth, staring at the dark hole hoping he'd appear out of it, safe and sound. But he never did.

I went to the police, my hands shaking as I tried to explain what we’d seen, what I’d experienced down there. I showed them the GoPro footage, hoping they’d take it seriously. I thought, for a moment, that they might. A detective brought me into a room, and watched the footage on my camera. They took the GoPro, and assured me they'd take care of it. For a moment, I believed them, and felt a feeling of relief. But as I left the police station that day, deep down, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd just made a huge mistake.

When I went back to the station to check in, they acted like they had no idea who I was. They denied ever having talked to me, denied ever seeing the footage. And then, to make it worse, they threatened to arrest me for trespassing if I didn’t leave the station immediately.

The footage, the evidence, it was all gone. They never gave it back to me. They covered it up and acted like it never happened. Cal was reported missing, but they chalked it up to him just running away, maybe with a girl or something,, he was an adult, after all.

I’ve never seen him again. And I know now, with a sickening certainty, that he either got discovered by them, and met a terrible fate. Or arguably worse, he’s still down there. Trapped. Forced to join them. That he’s now one of them.",179,0.97,11,Weird-Suggestion-152,2024-11-07 11:19:29,1glvp99,190,High
NoSleep,Faceless Mary,"Hey nosleep. I’m Trish, I’ve lurked on this subreddit for a while now, reading everyone’s experiences and what not. I always was skeptical of them, until about a month ago. I’m in high school, junior year to be exact, and at homecoming something happened.

My best friend, Mary, was always a bit of a recluse. Even when we were five she would fake being sick just to stay at my house for the day. Even after our parents stopped talking to each other my dad would always let her stay the night despite his own issues with her parents. I never knew what happened between them, I don’t think I ever will after what happened.

Mary liked to prank people, a lot. She got in trouble with so many of our teachers because of her pranks. I remember this one day in our freshman year, she was pitching a scheme to me. She wanted to glitter bomb our homeroom teacher, ended up suspended for a day because of it.

I think that fueled her pranks, honestly I wish it never did. I wish she just stopped. I wish she didn’t get worse. She kept pranking our teachers, kept getting suspended and getting detentions. It got worse. I didn’t think anything of it when it happened, I was like a frog in a slowly boiling pot. I didn’t realize how bad it was until it was too late. How could I?

She stuck to her glitter bombs for a long time, it was harmless minus the mess. No one would think anything of it. I certainly didn’t. When she started taking interest in those more advanced glitter bombs I didn’t care. It was just glitter. In our sophomore year she started taking a mechanics class.

She was so excited about it. She’d rush to my house after school each day and have me make things with her. I didn’t fully get all of it, but Mary was so happy. Even when she started bringing car parts over I didn’t think anything of it.

One time she came over and slammed this car engine onto the coffee table, I nearly fell out of the couch at the slamming noise.

“Be careful, that’s an old table!” My dad called from the kitchen. He always avoided her when she came over.

“Sorry, Mr. Davidson!” Mary called back, before whipping her head over to me. She blew some of her black hair out of her face, smiling wide. “Guess how much I got this for!”

I sighed, moving to stand up. “There’s a dump right by your house, I know you got it from there.”

“Actually that closed, dangerous conditions or something I don’t know. Nah, Mrs. Forrest gave it to me!” Mary said. “Completely free of charge. She phrased it as a school project, but apparently it’s not exactly for a grade.”

“Not exactly?”

“She phrased it weirdly.” Mary shrugs.

“Ah. So what do you need to do to it?” I asked.

Mary beamed. “Clean it out, get rid of some dents and the rust.”

“That doesn’t sound fun.” I point out

“Doesn’t mean I can’t make it fun.” Mary retorted

I shrugged, not knowing how to reply to that. For the rest of the day Mary and I worked at it until she had to head home. I never liked working at car parts, but she loved it. Mary always loved the mechanical aspect of things. Maybe she should’ve been a suspect when things first started to happen.

Mrs. Forrest, Mary’s mechanics teacher, ended up hospitalized three months later. I never learned too many of the details, but I remember when the cops came to my door. They asked me if I knew her, knew anyone who had a grudge against her in her class, all of that. Apparently a fuse blew while she was grading a project, and she couldn’t remember which one went off.

Everyone knew it was some sort of foul play, but no one knew who it was. I never suspected Mary, and maybe it never was her, but everything else lined up so well. She just seemed so worried. She was my best friend, how could I suspect her? Why would I? Surely the police would figure it out and make an arrest, but they never did.

More incidents occurred, all to teachers. Mrs. Forrest was the only one who taught Mary, but all of them had a similar case. Something blew in their house, and their face became heavily scarred as a result.

After the fourth incident, Mary started acting weird. She became fixated on her face. Whenever she came over she’d pick and scratch at it. Her face became red and raw. My dad started to buy her face creams, and he even considered talking to her parents. I didn’t know why he worried so much. I didn’t know why then.

Once the school year ended, the incidents stopped. Mary became more aggressive to other students in our year, but never to me. Then junior year began. It was going to be our first year having a prom. We were gonna go together, as we always did with homecoming.

Even then, we still treated homecoming as serious as we could. We went dress shopping where we always did. It was this small store owned by Ms. Ellen and her grandkids. Ms. Ellen would always make the most intricate dresses, and we loved them.

We were looking through the store, every year Ms. Ellen would make something new and we were excited to see what it was. This time all of her dresses had some sort of bow motif. Mary found a sleeveless red dress with a large frilly skirt, the waist was wrapped with a black ribbon with a bow in the back. It was beautiful, and Mary looked beautiful in it when she tried it on. I ended up with a blue dress, it was the same design as Mary’s, but with a white ribbon instead.

Mary seemed blank that day, staring into space almost every minute. I wasn’t bothered, she always spaced out. Yet this was different. It was longer, and she seemed focused on whatever she was staring at. Once I saw her moving her jaw up and down, almost like a dummy being puppeteered to talk.

It was creepy, but maybe it was nothing. I ignored it. I ignored every sign until it was too late, until homecoming came and I saw what she became. Maybe if I noticed sooner, maybe if I said something, maybe she’d be ok.

Homecoming was the same as always, at first. I got there before Mary, sticking by the food table as I waited for her. Music was going, and it covered up the squeaking of shoes on the gym floor. It was dark, only being lit up with colored spot lights.

I was focused on the doors, and soon enough they opened. Into the gym stepped Mary. She was completely barefoot, dirt and grass sticking to her feet, her hair was barely brushed, draping down her masked face, yet her dress was perfect, having no stains or tears. It was almost like a doll you played with too much.

For some reason, I didn’t walk over to her. My feet were glued to the ground. She slowly moved her hand to her face, her fingernails looked sharp and like they were stained with something. Mary carefully removed her mask, hair falling to the side.

She didn’t have a face. It wasn’t there. I mean it was there but it just wasn’t. Instead of the red and raw skin, there wasn’t any skin at all. Instead rough, patchy, bleeding flesh. She tore off her own face.

A chaperone quickly went to check on her, while another took out his phone to presumably call an ambulance. Before the chaperone approaching her could even get a word out, Mary lunged at her. She was like an animal, tearing at the screaming chaperones face.

The homecoming turned to chaos. Some braver students attempted to shove Mary away, only to get stabbed by the knife she wielded. I can’t believe I didn’t notice it at first. Many ran, the chaperone calling 911 got through. I’m still convinced that’s why so many survived. I doubt we would have without him. Mary got off of the chaperone she had mauled, and began to charge at whoever she could. She stabbed, she tore, she fought. Mary was like an animal. I didn’t run like so many others. No one tried to get me.

Soon enough, Mary and I were the only breathing things in that room. Bodies littered the ground, their faces all bloodied or gone. Mary limped forward towards me, I guess someone got a lucky hit. She tilted her head, hazel eyes shining in the remaining lights.

I finally managed to convince my body to cooperate, taking a step backwards. “Mary..?” I began slowly.

She let out an animalistic grunt, the muscles around her eyes contracting in what I could only assume was a smile.

For some reason, she didn’t seem like a threat to me. Don’t get me wrong, I was terrified, but I just knew she wouldn’t hurt me. Somehow I knew. I didn’t step closer, I wasn’t stupid, but when she got right in my face I didn’t step away.

She reached a hand up to my hair, tracing through it. Her fingers twirled through the blonde and her muscles contracted in that smile. Her fingers were sharp, almost like claws. I’m not sure what happened, I don’t think I’ll ever know what happened.

When the sirens approached, Mary jerked away from me and ran. Police rushed into the gym, and when they saw me as the only living thing there they took me away and wrapped me in a shock blanket. It wasn’t cold, but the heavy and uncomfortable fabric soothed me. I told the police what I saw, and when the other survivors confirmed the story the police got off my back.

There weren’t too many causalities, according to the police. Apparently only a few people actually died before making it to the hospital, I think our local news put it to three deaths? I don’t think anything’s made it to the big news networks, we’re a small town and it’s not like death is uncommon these days. They’d want something big, I don’t really know if this qualifies.

They’re still looking for Mary, and even if they haven’t found her it’s only been a month. We all know she’s still out there. They would have more answers, but when the police went to her parents house they found their fate. According to the police there were symbols tattooed on their backs.

I know my dad knows something about it, but he won’t tell me anything. He says it’s not worth it. He says Mary’s gone now. I know she’s not. I know she’s still out there, still in this neighborhood, still lurking. I know she won’t hurt me, but anyone could be next. I don’t know what to do. I still care about Mary, and I know she cares about me but I can’t just go after her can I?

I’m scared, I just want my friend back. How am I supposed to go back to school? How am I meant to recover?

I don’t know. Everything went away, everything I cared about left me and my dad doesn’t even care enough to tell me what he knows.",67,0.95,14,Last-Article-2640,2024-11-07 14:20:24,1gm01xb,81,High
NoSleep,Not All Imaginary Friends Are Friendly,"Have you ever known true fear? No, I’m not talking about the heart palpitations you get when watching a scary film, or even the extreme discomfort that say a fear of heights or spiders may bring on. I’m talking about raw, unfiltered terror. If you haven’t then allow me to describe it to the best of my abilities. It’s like having a split personality, one side of you is paralysed, numb to everything around you, every sound muffled and distorted, even your own thoughts. On the other side of it your mind is simultaneously screaming at you, neurons firing in overdrive as it begs your nerves to release their death grip on your muscles and let you get away. I’ve experienced such a feeling once. I’d only known Katie for a few weeks but when I awoke at 3am to see her kneeling astride me on my bed, the painfully wide, manic grin that split her face bouncing as she gave those deep , earsplitting, inhuman giggles. Behind the kitchen knife raised over my chest, her gaze was locked onto mine, empty but for the cold, furious madness dancing within her almost glowing blue eyes. If my sister hadn’t shrieked from the doorway at the sight, snapping me out of it long enough to instinctively punch the distracted girl in the face before throwing her to the floor and making a run for it, I know my life would have ended that night. It was pure luck that my little sister had fought with her parents earlier that day and begged to crash at mine for the night. Pure luck that she had woken to use the bathroom when she did and heard the giggles. Pure luck that I’m alive to write this now. However, what I’ve learnt over the past few days has taught me a valuable lesson. 

I thought nothing would come close to the fear I felt that night, somehow, living through such an event made me feel stronger. Until I read those damned books. Until I started questioning my own mind, my own… sanity. I thanked my lucky stars every day since that I’d remained in the world of the living. Now though? Now I’m starting to think I’m the unlucky one…

Apologies because this is going to be long. 

I first met Katie almost exactly four years ago. From the moment I laid eyes on her I felt this strong protective urge which made sense considering the circumstances. I was walking home from work on a Friday night following a blazing row with my boss that I was pretty sure would mean more job hunting in the near future. I’ve never been good at holding down employment. The weather reflected my mood, the cloying, gray clouds seemed to smother any light coming from the street lamps while the downpour of rain drenched my clothes leaving them clinging tightly to my defeated form. I hadn’t realised one of my shoes had suffered a tear until part way into my walk but the wet squelch every time my sodden right roof met the pavement was a constant reminder. I was only about five minutes from home, the bottle of whiskey in my cupboard mentally calling to me after my shitty day when I heard it. Barely audible over the raindrops thundering against the floor, there was sobbing. I slowed and looked around before I spotted her. Sat huddled against the wall in a small alleyway was a young woman. Her hands were clasped against her ears as if trying to block out the world while she rocked back and forth, uncontrollable sobs wracking her tiny, soaked body, strands of hair clinging to her cheeks matted with both rain, and the tears freely flowing from her eyes. She was pretty, even in the state she was in it was easy to see how attractive she was. That probably helped in my following decision. I like to think I’d have done the same for anyone but I often didn’t make the best choices in life and the way I’ve treated people has left me with plenty of regrets, I’m ashamed to say. Shaking some water from my hair (not that it made the slightest difference) I sighed quietly and walked over to her. 

She didn’t notice my approach, between the palms clasped to her ears and the tightly shut eyes, I was all but invisible to her. It was only when I reached out and gently touched her arm did her soft, brown eyes spring open in surprise, looking like a startled animal debating whether or not to flee. I stepped back, hands raised in a peaceful gesture with what I’d hoped was a kind smile on my face. Her gaze remained firmly locked on me and I suddenly had doubts as I realised how out of my depth I was.

“Are… are you ok?” I’d asked, flinching as I finished upon realising what a stupid question it was. The girl regarded me for a few more seconds before shaking her head as fresh sobs began to bubble up. I wanted to run away, I wasn’t equipped to deal with this, this was so far out of my comfort zone that all I wanted was to be far, far away. But I didn’t. There was something about her, her frail, tiny build, looking even smaller in the curled up position. The kindness swimming behind the distraught veneer in her eyes. This was someone without a malicious bone in their body, to just abandon her like this would be human. “S-sorry, I don’t want to be rude but I want to help… I’m Will…” I trailed off helplessly. The ghost of a smile appeared on her lips if only for half a second.

“Katie,” she whispered back hoarsely after a few seconds, “and thank you, but I don’t think you can help.” Despite the situation, the warmth and authenticity of her tone made me glad I hadn’t run, increasing that protective instinct I felt towards her.

“Well, at least let me call you a taxi to get home, sitting out in this can’t be helpful, unless you’re a secret mermaid,” I tried to joke and cheer her up, instantly cringing at how decidedly unfunny it was. But she laughed, it was a short, weak laugh, I’m sure she was only doing it to be nice, or maybe she was laughing at the weakness of my humour but either way, it thrilled me to see that momentary cheer slipping through her devastated facade before she crumpled once more, whispering about how she couldn’t go back to that place, even the thought of it seemingly terrifying her. 
“I only live round the corner, if you want to at least get out of the rain I can fix you a coffee.” I mentally facepalmed as I said it. As if she would just accept an invite to someone’s house who up until two minutes ago she’d never laid eyes on. 

“Ok..” she sniffed, a little warily, fixing me with those glistening, trusting orbs. In that moment I wanted to keep her safe from all the evils of the world, I hated the fact that such an innocent looking, trusting person could be in so much pain. I held out a hand and she gingerly took it, letting me help her to her feet. That was how I met Katie.

Upon returning to my house, she had slumped exhausted into a chair, gratefully accepting a towel while I muttered an embarrassed apology about the mess (which she waved away, of course) before going to flick the kettle on. It was only when she took the mug that I realised how badly she was shivering, she must have been outside for hours. The grateful smile I got after fetching her a blanket made my heart melt a little. I nearly dropped my mug when she explained the source of her misery. Her older brother had been found dead in a park that very morning. I remembered hearing of his death when I got to work, the latest in a string of vicious murders that had rocked the area over the past few months. The prevailing rumour had been that he’d been walking home drunk after a night out and passed out in a park bench only for his cold, mutilated corpse to be discovered by an unfortunate jogger early the next day. Upon telling me this, she had once again dissolved into helpless tears. Me, with my limited skills interacting with women, had decided the most comforting thing I could do was lean forward and gently pat her shoulder (yes I know, pathetic really). The tight hug she pulled me into as she sobbed into my chest filled me with a calming, blissful sensation I only ever experienced with her. 

Throughout the evening I slowly got more information from her. She lived with her brother, at least she had, hence why she couldn’t face going home. After a couple of hours, I asked if she was hungry and offered to order a takeaway. Sure, I had food, but I didn’t think offering her a pot noodle was the best course of action. She’d smiled and nodded but insisted that she would cover the cost to thank me. I tried to disagree but she wouldn’t budge and that was how we ended up huddled beside each other, eating Chinese and watching Netflix within four hours of meeting each other. I offered her the spare room that night. My roommate had moved out about a week back so the room was empty, and it had a bolt on the door I reassured her. I could tell she didn’t want to be a burden but the exhaustion after her day had begun to get overwhelming so she agreed and thanked me with a peck on the cheek. Katie ended up staying with me all weekend and it was the happiest I'd been in a long time. Seeing her slowly coming out of her shell and gradually begin to smile more gave me an indescribable rush.

On the Sunday night she said she was ready to go home, but shyly asked if I could come with her. I agreed without hesitation. She had sobbed upon entering her apartment, despairing at seeing her brother's things that he’d never lay eyes on again. Once more, I comforted her and helped to calm her down. She begged me to stay the night with her and once again, my agreement came without delay. When she tiptoed into the living room at midnight, just as I was nodding off on the couch, and asked me to come and share her bed because she felt so alone in there, I didn’t need to be asked twice. I wrapped her up in a tight hug beneath the sheets, only giving the weathered looking stuffed toy on her bed a glance, before she turned to me, thanked me again and gave me a soft kiss, this time on the lips. We had sex for the first time that night. Yes I know, you might think I was taking advantage of her being so vulnerable, and the thought crossed my mind many times but she was very much the instigator. I like to think it was her way of distracting herself. Not that I was complaining, it had been a very long time and being with her was mind blowing. 

We saw each other every day for the next three weeks and I felt like I was living the high life. Every day she grew back into herself more and more, that tiny, shy smile I’d seen that day in the rain blossoming over time into a joyous beam. I’d never met such a gentle and caring soul. Katie loved nothing more than going for walks in the park and scattering food for animals. I’ve never seen someone happier than she would be when she was petting someone’s dog. The time we saw a dead bird by the side of the road she’d cried and cried, insisting we take it away and bury it. Honestly, I found that to be more than a little far but I simultaneously loved her for it. Yes I know, we’d hardly known each other for long but I already knew I loved her, I’ve never loved anyone like that and doubt I ever will again. 

I also learnt a lot about her past. It made sense how well she was getting over her brother’s death when I learnt of her childhood. She had grown up with her father, she didn’t remember her mother, the woman having left when she was still a baby. From what I can gather, all she had wanted was a son, she had no wishes for a daughter and had one day just walked out with Katie’s brother, Mark. Her father had forbidden his wife’s name from even being spoken in his house. I had felt so angry that someone could just abandon such an incredible girl but I was relieved to hear that her upbringing was so happy. As she put it, her father showered her with more love and attention than any other parent could begin to manage. Unfortunately he had passed away a couple of years prior. Mark had reached out to her a year later and they’d started seeing more and more of each other until they got a place together, making up for all those lost years.

It was just over three weeks since I’d met Katie that I awoke to see her there with the knife. Not an hour before I had drifted off with her snuggled up against me and now there she was about to snuff my life out like a match being clasped between two fingers. You know how the story goes from here. By the time the police arrived, she was rocking back and forth in the corner, bawling and screaming, constantly cursing ‘Greg’, whoever that  was. When I discovered that Katie was responsible for all the murders that had been terrorising the city, I didn’t believe it. How could such a small, frail, gentle soul be behind such atrocities. Evidence doesn’t lie though, and it was damning. I was there for the entire trial, the whole process I felt my world crumbling. The Defense listed disorder after disorder and I felt sick to my stomach. Sick with pity, this wasn’t her fault, it… it couldn’t be. I tried so many times to meet her eyes but she’d never look at me, instead rocking back and forth in the dock while she sobbed uncontrollably and muttered about Greg. I don’t think anyone was too surprised when she was sent to a mental hospital but I felt the remaining shards of my heart break.

I visited her just once. Visits were forbidden for the first month but as soon as I could I went to see her. She looked good, but she could barely meet my eyes. There was a doctor nearby but she had no restraints or anything, I guess due to her stature she wasn’t seen as any kind of risk. At first she wouldn’t even look at me until I begged her to do so. When she did, our eyes were only locked for a second, those soft hazel irises bringing a light back into my life momentarily before she burst into tears and turned, running from the room calling herself a monster. The Doctor gave me a sympathetic smile and turned to jog after her. When he returned and informed me she wouldn’t be returning and didn’t want to see me ever again, I didn’t even try to hold back my own tears. 

Every day felt horrendous without Katie, I never moved past her and when I met Lewis, I jumped at the opportunity I had been given. Lewis was a friend of a friend, he seemed like a pretty boring guy and I’d probably have never thought twice about him. I got stuck next to him in the bar, trying to make awkward small talk. When he revealed that he worked at the same hospital Katie was being held at, I damn near jumped for joy. Just like that I made it my mission to get close to Lewis, if only for the constant updates I could get about Katie’s progress. I know he found it a little strange, and he even said as much to me once, but when I explained a little of our personal history he relented, conceding that she was one of the sweetest people he’d ever met.

I learnt that her first year there she’d been erratic at best, some days kind, friendly and eager to please but others she’d just scream and shout and rage against Greg. He asked if I knew who Greg was since all the staff there were at a loss but I was just as stumped. Since then however, she’d been making excellent progress. Her meltdowns had steadily become more infrequent until they had completely stopped almost a year ago. When I learned that Katie’s case would be coming up for consideration into her entering a supervised living arrangement I let out a genuine whoop. 

Three days later Katie killed herself. It was the 29th October and it was all over the news. Apparently she had stabbed herself in the face and neck so viciously and so many times that it was impossible to identify the body by sight alone. I reacted the only way I could, by spending the next week totally drunk with one question in my distraught mind. Why? It was a week after the news broke that Lewis found me, clutching an almost empty bottle of whiskey in the corner of a bar we hit regularly. He gently prized the bottle from my fingers as I looked up at him with unfocused eyes. The pitying smile on his face made me ashamed of myself and I’ve never hated myself more than I did in that moment. Pulling out a chair across from me, he put his bottle of Corona down on the table while placing a glass of water in front of me and telling me to drink. I did. Lewis offered his condolences as was to be expected before hesitating, his voice taking on a more serious tone.

“Look man, I know how much she meant to you so I’ve got something here, don’t tell anyone though because it could cost me my job.” Lewis muttered, looking straight at me. I straightened up, the booze fuelled haze clearing somewhat as I focussed on him. “She uh, she wrote, wrote a lot in her diary, she had a big box of them going back to when she was younger. They were in the pile of stuff to be incinerated because there was no next of kin but I grabbed the box… thought maybe, you’d be interested…” he trailed off as I nodded furiously, it would be nowhere near having her with me but it was something, some small part of her. Lewis nodded knowingly and slid a small box over to me. I made my excuses to leave as soon as possible, desperate to get home and see the books. Lewis didn’t seem surprised and told me he’d see me soon. 

When I got home, I opened the first one in the box and immediately recoiled. There was a crude, childish drawing inside the cover. It was a man, absurdly dressed in an orange and blue pinstripe suit. He had long brown hair with a far too small top hat perched upon it. I recognised it vaguely and made the connection to that aged stuffed toy Katie kept on her bed. The drawing however, was unnerving, it had a manic, almost feral grin, open in soundless laughter while his crudely drawn, almost familiar, piercing blue eyes seemed to stare deep into my soul. Underneath the drawing were two words. ‘Giggling Greg’. I started reading and whatever hope I had in humanity, whatever optimism lived inside me was crushed, slowly, painfully ground into nothing as the harsh reality of this world burnt itself into my retinas. I’m going to transcribe a few of the entries for you below, the ones I think are most important to try and understand the events surrounding Katie. I must warn you, reading these made me feel sick to my stomach.

Note: I’ve fixed the spelling and grammar errors in the earlier entries.

March 18th 2006

Dear Diary, I finally turned seven! Well actually it was yesterday but I was too excited to write in you then! Do you like my drawing, that’s my imaginary friend, Giggling Greg. He always looks after me when I feel sad and makes me feel better after Daddy gets cross. He looks just like Daddy’s toy that he said he had when he was a boy. He never lets me play with it though because it’s old and I might break it. I wanted to have a party and invite people over but no one wanted to come. I’m so lucky to have Greg and Daddy as friends or I’d have none. I was so happy when I got the big cuddly dog. He fits in my bed with me and he’s called spot. I love dogs so much! Daddy didn’t get angry at all, I think it’s because he wasn’t drinking that yucky drink that makes him talk funny. He can get very mean when he drinks that and it’s scary but he’s always really nice after and makes me feel better.


September 4th 2010

Dear Diary,
I had my first day at big school today. It was very scary, I don’t know anyone and some of the older kids are so big and grown up. Luckily, Greg was there with me, making me feel safe. I have lots of new teachers, most of them are really cool but I hate my science teacher, she’s already given us homework. Daddy asked if I made any friends but I didn’t. He says it’s weird that I don’t have any but I have Greg. Last time I told him about Greg when I was nine though he got very angry and told me I was too old for imaginary friends. On the plus side at least he got me makeup for the first time to say sorry, he got me some sparkly lipgloss and concealer because he said I couldn’t hide my face from people. I don’t talk about Greg anymore but he’s still my best friend, he always looks out for me and says what I’m too scared to. It always makes me laugh when he starts giggling. Anyway I have to go now and do my science homework (YUK!)


April 3rd 2016

Dear Diary,
I accidentally mentioned Mum today and Daddy got very angry, asking me why I was banging on about that stupid fart who didn’t give a shit about us. I felt really bad for upsetting him but I didn’t like him being so mean (you know how much I hate bad language). It’s really stressful at the moment because my exams are starting soon so I’m doing lots of work. At least everyone at school is distracted by that though so they’re mostly leaving me alone. Jessica’s still a horrible bully though. Today she surrounded me with her friends and they kept on shoving me and slapping me. It didn’t really hurt, Daddy hits me much harder when I do something silly and I know that doesn’t matter because he always tells me how much he loves me so why should this matter. I couldn’t help but cry though which just made them laugh more. Luckily lunch was ending so they had to leave me alone. Greg was very angry, he kept saying he’d punch and kick those girls so much that it’d make Daddy proud. I told him not to be mean but he was giggling while he said it so I know he was joking.

 Damnit! I’ve just seen the time, I was so focussed on studying that I didn’t realise it was so late. Dad will be home any minute and I forgot to make dinner for us! This is going to hurt, why am I such an idiot?! Greg keeps telling me to stand up to him but it’s my fault.



January 2nd 2018

Dear Diary,
Sorry it’s been so long, my head’s been in pieces. Daddy died last week. They said he took loads of sleeping pills and it was suicide, that he was already weak from how much he drank. I don’t understand, he never seemed suicidal. Greg keeps saying he doesn’t think it was suicide while giggling, he can be so weird sometimes! Then again, I’m 18 and my only friend is an imaginary one so maybe we’re as bad as each other? I miss my Daddy so much. He loved me so much and was so kind. Even when he got really cross when he was drinking, he’d always be so regretful after hurting me and made me feel so special. The funerals this weekend and I’m dreading it, saying goodbye to Daddy forever. What will I do with my life now? 


November 1st 2020

Dear Diary,
It’s been a crazy week. I’m ashamed to say it but I nearly ended it all when I found about about Mark’s death. All of our childhoods apart only to reunite and then have him taken away from me again. The pain is indescribable. Greg was very nasty, he didn’t like Mark, kept saying we should get rid of him, kept accusing him of trying to steal me. It annoys me how possessive Greg can be but I worked out long ago he’s with me for the long run. I just hope he likes Will. I met him the same day I heard about Mark. He’s absolutely amazing. He showers me with attention and does everything for me. I can’t believe I met someone so perfect. It’s only been a week but I feel like I’ve known him my whole life. I told him about Daddy, how special he was. I didn’t mention the times he got angry though, I know Will won’t understand and I’d hate to make him upset. 

Greg still isn’t sure about Will but I really hope he comes round, he has to, I’ve never met such an amazing person. I hope he doesn’t realise I’m a freak like everyone at school did and run away, I don’t know how I’d cope knowing I lost him. He’s been so good helping me cope with the loss of Mark and he treats me like a normal human! I’m going to meet him now, I’ll check in again soon.


November 13th 2020

Dear Diary,
Kill Will, Kill Will, Kill Will. That’s all I’ve been hearing the last few days. I don’t understand, why doesn’t Greg like him? Why would he say such things? He’s ‘giggling’ when he says it, but it isn’t nice, not like it used to be. Maybe it never was? I put my foot down today though. Greg kept saying that Will only likes me because I’m damaged goods beaten by Daddy. I hate how nasty he is and I finally put my food down. I told him I don’t need him anymore, I have Will and he’s a better, kinder man than Greg can ever dream of being. Greg went very quiet and called me a weak willed little whore still in the grasp of her Daddy’s dead fingers and I yelled at him to ‘Piss off.’ (Sorry diary, you know how much I hate swearing but I was so cross) It worked, Greg’s finally gone. I’m free now, free to enjoy my life with Will.



January 16th 2022

Dear Diary,
They finally let me have you back. I’m sorry. I’m sorry it’s been so long but a lot has happened. I don’t want to tell you right now, I’m not ready but I will. I lost Will. It’s my fault, I’m a monster. He came to see me the other day and I couldn’t face him. I watched him leave from my window, he was in tears and so was I but he can’t be near me, I can’t hurt him like the others. But it wasn’t me, it was Greg. I mean, I did it, but Greg made me, he didn’t go for long, he came back. He nearly killed Will. I can’t put him at risk, he’s so much better without me. Being in this hospital is more than I deserve, you don’t know how bad it is, I deserve to be dead, I’m a stain on the world. The doctors here keep listing all these illnesses but I’m not crazy. I’M NOT. IT'S ALL GREGS FAULT. HE DID THOSE HORRIBLE THINGS, I WASNT THERE I UNDERSTAND NOW! THE TIMES WHEN I DONT REMEMBER ANYTHING GREG IS IN CONTROL! I’m going to sleep, the light hurts, the silence hurts, my mind hurts and Greg won’t shut up. I hope I dont wake up tomorrow.


May 3rd 2023:

It’s not fair, Will’s still putting in requests to see me. Why won’t he move on, I love him so much why won’t he let himself be happy? Greg won’t shut up, calling him a pathetic freak like me. I wish I could scrub him from existence. I hear his giggles every day and every night, the stream of ranting, raging filth coming out of his mouth. There were some frogs in the garden near the pond, they’ve been there for about a week and I loved sitting and watching them for hours. I blacked out yesterday, again and when I came too in my room, Greg told me he squished them all. I went out this morning and saw their broken bodies. I cried so much, I hate hate hate Greg, why did I have to imagine him? Why? Why did Daddy have that stupid doll? I wish he’d let me play with it and break it, even if he’d put me in a coma it might have meant Greg won’t exist. I said that and Greg was very angry. When I came too he’d slammed my face against the wall so hard my nose broke. 

No one else knows this but Greg killed Daddy. He finally admitted it to me. I think I knew all along but he made me crush those pills up and put them in Daddy’s Whiskey. Why? First Daddy, all those other people, then Mark, then almost Will and now the frogs? For what? All of them were Greg. ALL OF THEM! I HOPE HE ROTS IN HELL ALONGSIDE ME THE SICK FREAK! I’ve accepted I’m going to hell. Even if God understands that Greg killed those people he’ll never forgive me for how I’ve hurt my beautiful Will. No not mine, he can’t be, no matter how much I want him, how much I love him. He deserves better than a freak like me.


28th October 2024

No no no no no. I heard them talking about it today. They think I might be able to leave this place soon. I can’t, I can't, it's not safe. I said I shouldn’t be allowed out yet but they said it’s just because it feels like home here now. I’m such an idiot! I hated the pitying looks they were giving me, like they were disappointed in me. I stopped ranting at Greg, just letting his venomous filth wash over me, convincing them I wasn’t a freak. I’m pretty sure I can make enough of a scene at the hearing to convince them to keep me here, but Greg said he’ll take over and make sure they let me out. He promised me that as soon as we’re out of here, he’s going to kill Will and make it hurt, to remind me I’m his. He can’t. He CANT DO IT. I need to stop him. I think I know how but I’m scared. I deserve it though, for bringing this monster into the world. I know it will crush Will. He has such a good heart and I know he thinks the world of me. I just pray he can eventually move on. 

The thought of Will with someone else tears me up more than anything Greg’s done, I know it’s selfish but it’s true. If anything I’m glad he’ll never know what I’m about to say because I think it would destroy him but I truly, deeply love him. In another world I could imagine a life with him, having a family, growing old together, devoting my heart and soul to him as I know he would to me. But not in this world. BECAUSE OF GREG! I HATE HIM. I HATE HIM SO MUCH! HE THINKS HES SO CLEVER AND IN CONTROL! Tomorrow he’ll get the shock of his life. I’m sorry Daddy. I’m sorry Mark. I’m sorry Diary. I’m sorry Will.



I finished reading them all a couple of days ago. I haven’t left my house. I haven’t showered. I haven’t eaten. I’ve just sat there, numb, dead to the world. We call ourselves the most sophisticated species on the planet yet how could we fail such a gentle, beautiful mind. Cause it to crack so badly. Katie truly was an angel, with everything that happened and she still managed to be such a beautiful person. She was right, her words have destroyed me. Irreparably so. 

I saw the first person I’ve seen since I was given the diaries earlier. It was a delivery man, delivering the coil of rope I ordered. I screwed up tying a noose on my first couple of attempts but you really can learn anything online. I looked at it when I was done. Knowing I’d be meeting the same fate as my Katie. Feeling hot, furious rage bubble up knowing how the system had failed someone suffering from a lifetime of abuse and mental illness. As my anger spiked, my boot lashed out, striking my coffee table, sending it, and the stack of diaries to the floor. I froze. One of them had fallen open. ‘Giggling Greg,’ stared at me with those pale, strikingly blue eyes and it hit me like a ton of bricks. That familiarity I felt when I first laid eyes on the picture. I’d seen those eyes once before. Staring at me behind the blade of a kitchen knife…

NoSleep,"I learned a secret about the Bermuda triangle, but I wish I hadn't","Ever since I was a kid I've been fascinated with the ocean. My mom hated it, she used to tell me all the time “If God intended for us to know about the ocean, he wouldn’t have put so many obstacles between us and the bottom of it.”

I thought that was… a bit reductionist, but when I insisted on studying biological oceanography and ocean engineering she was as supportive as she could possibly be. College was the best time in my life. I loved my studies, my mom and I even bonded over it as she let me tell her all about what I was learning about the ocean. Even though she didn’t love the field I chose, she still pitched in for my education and encouraged me to live at home until I was done. She was my biggest supporter.

Two weeks after I graduated college my dad died, and with his death my mom seemed to lose all her will to live. She tried to hold on for me, but every day I could see the light slipping from her eyes a little more. She died the day after my interview for my dream job, and to this day I’m convinced she did that on purpose. She knew her time was coming, and she waited so I wouldn’t miss my interview. My friends always tell me that’s a little morbid, but when I light candles for my mom spirit I can feel her there with me and I know it’s true.

Anyway, I got the call with the job offer a few days after her funeral, another small blessing that I knew came from her, and despite wanting to just lay down and give up on everything I accepted the job. I was still heartbroken about losing both of my parents within a few months of each other, but the job was everything I had dreamed and more. 

After a few years I was given the opportunity to join a team that was researching previously unexplored parts of the ocean, I got assigned to the coolest place ever: the Bermuda Triangle.

I know, I know, we all grew up hearing stories about the Bermuda Triangle and most of them can be explained by science and weather patterns. But the stories that can’t be explained by science, unfortunately, I can offer you an explanation for. Turns out my mom was right, sometimes obstacles are there for a reason.

The first few weeks of our research expedition were exciting. We had a place we were staying in Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, but since that’s still a good 640 miles from our research site we also had a fairly nice boat we were staying on, and the team got funds for a submarine. I won’t bore you with all the scientific details of our expedition, but after about two months we were granted permission to send four people into the bermuda triangle, in a submarine.

Our team lead decided she would select three people to go with her, and out of our eleven person team, we knew there would be a lot of disappointed people. She said she would give us her decision individually, to avoid the awkwardness for everyone who wasn’t selected. I was a bundle of nerves for the whole week it took her to decide, but on a bright beautiful Sunday morning Marnie found me in my bunk and told me I had been selected.

To be honest, a part of me knew deep down that I was going to be picked. There was no way all of these things would have lined up so perfectly, just for me to be left behind while someone else went on the submarine trip. As it turns out, we would all be better off if someone else had been selected.

Three days later we were ready to take the submarine down to the ocean floor. The people in our group were myself, Marnie, an older man named Jacob, a guy about my age named Evan, and the ninety person crew running the submarine. We all had our hopes for what we would discover, but I think everyone was just elated to be a part of something so big.

The first few days in the submarine were mostly spent getting our bearings, charting, mapping, and getting used to being so deep under water. After that, we were able to use some pretty high tech equipment that looked a lot like the suits astronauts wear to actually leave the submarine. I still lay awake at night and think about what that was like. The ocean was dark, it reminded me of fog actually, the way you can see up to a certain point before it all blurs into one meaningless color. Only instead of fog, we were in an inky darkness all the time. I could see a few feet in front of me at any given moment, the wonders of the ocean hidden behind a cold, wet, dark veil, all there for me and my team to uncover.

After a couple days of collecting samples and specimens Jacob and I made a huge discovery. Caught between a rock and the ocean floor was a scuba suit, in a design neither of us had ever seen before.

Our suits, top of the line equipment not currently available to the public, looked a lot like space suits. This one looked like a toddler had tried to copy what we were wearing, but lacked the ability to really do it justice. The hands looked like mittens, almost exactly the way a small child would think to draw them. The helmet was oddly oblong and looked like a large bucket with holes cut out for the eyes and mouth. The eye and mouth holes were covered with glass, and the top of the helmet was rounded instead of flat like a bucket would be, giving it an odd misshapen appearance. 

The body was misshapen as well, with a barrel-like torso and uneven arms and legs. While I couldn’t tell what the helmet was made from, it was clear that the body seemed to be made out of leather. The helmet and body almost seemed suctioned, or glued together. There was no zipper, no buttons, no way I could see to dismantle it in order to put it on. More importantly, it was clear the suit was very old, but it showed none of the signs of damage that something like that should have after sitting at the bottom of the ocean for so long.

Jacob and I glanced at each other, then rushed toward the strange sight as if we were both thinking the same thing. We worked together to move the rock off it, then cleared the debris that had gathered around the suit, mostly fish bones and small carcasses. 

We did so in complete silence, but despite the lack of words I knew we were both beyond excited. Whatever this was, we were on the cusp of an incredible discovery.

We freed the strange looking divers suit and carried it back to the submarine. An hour later Jacob and I stood with the rest of the crew, everyone hovered around the table we had placed it on. 

We had debated for a while if we thought it would hold up, bringing it out of the water and into a strange atmosphere, and Marnie logically decided we needed to resurface as quickly as possible, so we could get the suit to a temperature and moisture controlled storage facility. She told the submarine captain, and he said he would prepare us to resurface first thing on the following day. In the meantime, Marnie told us to work our asses off to get as much done as possible before departure. She told us that if the submarine went back down she would probably give other people on the team the opportunity to be on the crew. That was disappointing, but I agreed it was only fair.

We put the suit in the storage room we had reserved for samples, locked the door, and went back to work. That night was when the first unusual thing occurred. Around one in the morning I woke up to piercing shrieks and raced out of my bunk, into the hallway.

One of the crew members, Rodriguez I think, was kneeling on the floor clutching his head and screaming. The captain knelt next to him, trying to talk over the sound of his screams, but all we could hear was Rodriguez repeating over and over “the eyes, it’s eyes”.

Nobody knew what that meant, but his fear was both palpable and contagious. The captain assured us that sometimes people struggle with being underwater for very long, and Rodriguez would get the best medical and psychiatric care possible once we got back to the surface. He insisted we all go back to bed, and everyone complied, slinking off to our bunks like a bunch of chastised children. 

The first thing I did in the morning was go back to the captain and ask if Rodriguez was okay. The captain smiled in greeting and assured me that Rodriguez was a bit sick, but they were sure he would be just fine. 

I thanked him, and as I was leaving I heard him call out, “If God wanted us to explore the ocean, we would have gills.”

It was my moms favorite joke. Every time I talked about new advances in oceanic technology she would say that to me with a smile and a pat on the arm. I turned around and stared at the captain.

I said, “What was that?”

He was already facing away from me, and glanced back over his shoulder, “Sorry, what?”

I knew my face was tight, my voice reflecting my nerves, “What did you say? As I was walking away, you said something about exploring the ocean.”
He gave me a concerned look, “Are you okay, Dr. Williams? I didn’t say anything.”

I nodded, every muscle in my body feeling like a tense rubber band, “Yeah, yes. I’m fine, thank you. I guess I was just lost in my thoughts.”

As I walked out he muttered, “Can’t have another crazy on my ship.”

I made my way back to the sample room, which was once again unlocked, and joined Marnie where she stood next to the area we had reserved just for the diving suit. Marnie had sent Evan out after Jacob and I came back to chip some pieces off the rock that had pinned the diving suit to the ocean floor, and he had also collected some bits of detritus around the area as well like fish bones, and other carcasses.

I walked over and said, “Have you had a chance to crack the suit open?”

Marnie smirked, knowing I was messing around and said, “Right, because I want to be the ocean version of the guy who destroyed the city of Troy. No, but there’s the craziest thing.”

I lifted an eyebrow and Marnie went on, “I don’t think there’s a body in here.”

I looked over at the diving suit and felt a strange pang of fear shoot through me, “How did it get down there then?”

Marnie shrugged, unbothered, “Maybe it dropped off a boat or something. We might never get an answer to that, but we can do some testing on it to see when it was made and what it’s made from.”

I scooted away from the wetsuit, the room feeling claustrophobic now, “Have you had a chance to run any tests, or are you waiting until we resurface?”

Marnie started to answer, when the door opened and a sheepish looking crew member walked in.

He said, “Doctors, I’m sorry to bother you but I have some bad news. We aren’t going to be able to resurface today after all, we’re experiencing serious technical issues.”

Marnie and I both looked at each other, mirroring the panic on each other’s faces, and in her best stern voice she said, “Define serious issues.”

The crew member glanced over his shoulder as if he was waiting for someone to step in and take over for him, then he replied, “I’ll let you have that conversation with the captain. All he told me to pass along was that we’re experiencing some strange weather that’s interfering with the radar, and he doesn’t feel safe resurfacing until it passes. He can lower us back to the ocean floor so you can continue your research though.”

Marnie sighed and passed a hand over her face, looking weary. “Yes, tell him that would be good. And please update us at your earliest convenience.” She stressed the word ‘earliest’ with a look on her face that always made lab assistants duck their heads and promise to do whatever she asked.

The crew member was no different, and he turned to flee quickly. Before he could escape I said, “Wait. What about Rodriguez? Is he going to be okay?”

The crew member went pale and said, “We… we don’t know. Captain Cameron says-” He stopped and squared his shoulders back, “He’ll be fine. We’ll get back to the surface as soon as we’re able, and in the meantime he’s fine in med bay.”

I let him run out then, and turned to Marnie who had already turned her own attention back to the samples. Before I could ask her thoughts on what was happening, she started giving me instructions, and I ran over to help her with the tests. If we had to be stuck underwater, we might as well be productive.

While the equipment we had on the sub was good, it wasn’t the equipment we needed to safely test the material of the suit, so we focused on analyzing the other specimens we took from the site instead. As we worked, I felt like the suit was a third person in the room, watching and judging silently as we worked.

Jacob and Evan joined us at some point, and the four of us made plans for how we would use our time until the sub could resurface. Marnie was mostly frustrated that we didn’t have a timeline. She wanted to map out as much time as possible, but hesitated to do that if she didn’t know how much time we had. Jacob and I encouraged her to schedule our days as if we were going to be staying for the full five days we would have had left, and promised to do all her top priority items first.

With that settled we went to the mess hall for dinner. When we got there I noticed that there seemed to be fewer people than usual. Rodriguez was missing, obviously, but I also noticed one of the female crew members I had started bonding with was gone too. I grabbed my food and sat down across from someone I had seen talking with her before.

I smiled and said, “Hi, I’m Mara Williams, one of the researchers. Uh… do you know where Claire Mason is?”

The crew member, I thought his name was Reynolds, gave me a weird look, then shook his head, stood, and left his half eaten tray of food where it was. I watched Reynolds walk away, feeling equal parts confused and irritated. A few minutes later Marnie walked over and grabbed my arm.

In a harsh whisper she said, “You need to come with me.”

I stepped out into the hallway, feeling anxiety wringing my stomach like a dishrag. Marnie didn’t say anything, but we walked down the hall until we reached sick bay. Once we got there, Captain Cameron stepped out with a concerned look on his face. I had last spoken with him that morning, and in that time it was as if he had aged twenty years.

He waited for us to step inside, then shut the door and said in a hushed voice, “Thank you both for coming. I’m sorry to be treating this so clandestine, but I have some concerns. I think you’ll understand.” He took a deep breath before continuing. “We seem to be having a problem with psychosis on board. You both saw what happened with Rodriguez. In the last twenty four hours, we’ve had two more crew members experience the same thing. That may not sound like a lot, but when you’re on a machine like this one, you need every person to be in the best health possible.”

He stepped aside and we saw Rodriguez, Claire, and another crew member I thought was named Anderson, all laying in their beds. They were asleep, they seemed peaceful.

Cameron continued, “They’re sedated. Every time they wake up they start screaming again, and we want to keep this quiet from as many people as possible. I told the crew we believe there’s a bout of mono going around, and to be cautious and stay out of sick bay. It’s not a good solution, but it’s what we have right now. I need you two to see if you can figure out what’s going on.”

Marnie lifted an eyebrow and put one hand on her hip, “We’re not equipped for that Captain. Neither of us have a degree in medicine or psychology. Don’t you have a doctor on board?”

Captain Cameron gave her a look that I can only describe as pure desperation, “Our medic isn’t equipped for this either, and we don’t have a psychologist for this expedition because it was supposed to be a short one. Please just… Do blood tests, something. Work with our medic and use any of his equipment that you need to. Figure out what’s going on.”

Captain Cameron left and I turned to Marnie and said, “This all started the night after we found the diving suit. Do you think we brought some kind of bacteria into the ship that’s making people sick?”

Marnie winced, “Shit. I hope not, but maybe we did. I’ll go take a sample from it to see if there’s anything weird, you go finish your dinner.” She started to leave, then stopped. “And Mara. Do not speak a word of this to anyone. We want to keep this quiet.”

I sulked back to the mess hall, feeling like my trip of a lifetime was slowly blossoming into a nightmare.

I finished my food, then went back to sick bay to check in with Marnie. She wasn’t there, and the medic was back but he hadn’t seen her either. Concerned now, I went back to the storage room. Sitting on the floor in the corner of the room was Marnie, tears flooding her cheeks, her eyes looking hollow and glassy.

I ran to her side, “Marnie! Marnie? Are you okay? What’s going on?”

She didn’t speak, didn’t move, just sat there like a shell of a person. I ran from the room, to the sick bay, and told the medic what was going on, then went to the control room to look for the captain. 

When I told him what happened to Marnie, and what our suspicions were, his face grew hard.

He said, “Lock the room you’ve got that thing in and don’t let anyone touch it. If one more person gets sick, I’m making you and your team get rid of it. And I’ll make you bleach the entire storage room to make sure no one else gets sick.”

I apologized for all the trouble, agreed to his conditions, and left to update Evan and Jacob. I know Marnie told me not to, but with her out of commission I needed as much support from the rest of our team as possible. 

When I got to the mens bunk area Evan and Jacob were both there looking tense. They motioned me inside and we huddled together on Jacob's bed. 

Jacob leaned in and whispered, “About twenty minutes after you and Marnie left we heard more screaming. Rugan this time, he was in the hallway near the storage room clutching his eyes and…” Jacob hesitated as if he wasn’t sure how to explain it, “He was begging for forgiveness. I don’t know what about or to whom, but he kept saying ‘I didn’t mean to, I'm sorry’, over and over.”

Evan took in a shaky breath and said, “We tried to help, but the person you were sitting with before Marnie grabbed you, I think his name is Reynolds, he pushed us away and told us not to say anything.”

My mind reeled. It seemed like something about the suit really was making people sick, maybe Rugan had gone into the storage room for some reason. Or maybe, an even worse thought, the bacteria on the suit that was causing this had migrated from the storage room somehow. An image popped into my head of invisible bacteria crawling along the floor, lit by a blacklight showing it moving in waves towards new victims.

I looked up at my two teammates and said, “Cameron,  Marnie, and I think the diving suit we found might have something to do with all this. Like maybe there's some kind of bacteria on it causing all this. And with Marnie in sick bay now too, I think we may be right.”

We all stared at each other for a long time before Jacob said, “This is bad.”

Evan and I nodded our agreement. Then Evan asked, “Well now what do we do? We can’t get rid of the suit, who knows what kind of discoveries we can make with it. And…” He cast his face down, “And this discovery could put all of our names on the map, you know? We could be something.”

Jacob put a fatherly hand on Evan’s arm, “Safety is far more important Evan. Don’t sacrifice lives to have your name on a plaque in some museum.” He turned back to me and said, “I think we need to put the diving suit back in the ocean, Mara. Some things weren’t meant to be found.”

I looked back and forth between Evan and Jacob, feeling the weight of being the tie breaker resting on me like an anchor. Finally, I made the worst mistake of my life.

I said, “I think we should try to stop whatever this is before we put the diving suit back. We came all this way, and I think it’s what Marnie would want.”

I could tell Jacob wanted to argue with me more, but when I mentioned Marnie he closed his mouth and lowered his eyes. We agreed to meet in the storage room in an hour to try and find a way to keep the suit quarantined so no one else would get sick. 

The running theory was that some kind of bacteria was causing encephalitis, swelling in the brain, that was causing hallucinations and catatonia. We didn’t have the right tools on board to properly diagnose them, but it was a good place to start.

The three of us split up to look for supplies that might help. Evan left to look for cleaning supplies, I went to med bay to get masks and gloves, and Jacob simply said he “had an idea” and ran off on his own. 

We had agreed to meet up outside the men's quarters again, which were thankfully on the other side of the building from the storage room. A little after nine I rejoined Jacob in the hallway.

When he saw me he sighed and said, “I knew it. I have a bad feeling.”

I lifted an eyebrow, “What do you mean?”

He gestured around us vaguely, “Evan isn’t here. I haven’t seen him since we parted ways, and finding cleaning supplies shouldn’t have taken very long.” 

I shook my head and handed him the gloves and mask, “Throw these on and let’s go check.”

Jacob sighed again, “I had hoped to stay away from that area until we can deal with this, but alright. Let’s go.”

We walked to the storage room together, and when we got there Jacob pulled me gently away from the door so he could enter first. When we walked in, neither of us were surprised to see Evan laying on the floor, hands over his head, sobbing. Jacob and I walked over and dragged Evan to his feet, and carried him to sick bay. When we got there we found a horrible sight. Somehow, in the last hour, ten more crew members had gotten sick.

We had started with a smaller crew, around ninety crew members (thirty people per shift, three shifts if I remembered correctly), since we were a smaller sub we didn’t need as many people. We were now down fifteen people, including Marnie and Evan. We were quickly turning into a skeleton crew, and while I didn’t know very much about submarines, I had a feeling that was really bad.

After we dropped Evan off, Jacob and I went to find Captain Cameron. We opened the sick bay door and before I could process what I was seeing, Jacob had pushed me to the floor and slammed the door shut.

Walking down the hallway was the diving suit. It slumped and lurched as though only one part of it at a time was able to hold itself up. We watched through the port window in the door as a crew member came around the corner and ran into the diving suit. The man smirked, as though he thought someone was playing a prank on him, and looked into the eyes of the mask. 

His face fell, his eyes widened, and he began sobbing, “I tried! I’m sorry I didn’t mean to let her drown, I was only a kid!”

He continued to sob, curling up into a ball on the floor as the diving suit continued to move. Jacob pulled me away from the window and placed his back to the door, blocking the port.

We stared at each other in silence for a long time before he said, “Okay. This is bad, and hard to believe.”

I nodded, feeling panic wrapping its cold clammy hands around my throat, “What’s happening? Is someone in the suit?”

Jacob took slow, steady breaths and I did my best to copy him. After a few minutes he said, “I don’t think so. I… I don’t know. I don’t think we can explain this.” He turned and looked out the window again and took a deep breath, “We need to get back to the mens bunk. I grabbed our wet suits and I think we’ll need them.”

I was able to manage a small smile, Jacob was a good person to have on my team. We made our way out of the med bay, both of us shielding our eyes with our hands to avoid looking directly at the eyes of the suit. As much as I wanted to believe there was some logical answer, it seemed like people were having breakdowns only after looking in its eyes.

We moved slowly, taking small careful steps as we walked down the hallway. We could hear more screams echoing around the ship. They seemed to be coming from the other side of the ship, which was good, but it wouldn’t be hard for the creature to catch up with us.

We finally got to the bunk room and Jacob threw the door open, both of us barrelling inside quickly, and we collapsed to the floor in a relieved heap. 

Jacob was breathing heavily, his face red, and I was worried he might have a heart attack. I found a bottle of water and passed it to him, then waited for him to recover. Finally his breathing steadied, and he nodded to me gratefully, then pointed across the room to where three diving suits sat on his bunk. 

I rushed forward and carried his over first, then grabbed my own and put it on. Once we were both fully suited up I turned to Jacob and asked, “What now?”

He gave me a stern look and said, “We have to get that thing off this ship. It’s too risky to try and contain it.”

I felt the words like a deep blow and hung my head with shame, “You’re right. I'm sorry.” 

Jacob put his hand on my shoulder and gave me a tight smile, “We’ll make this right, don’t worry about it too much.”

We both put our helmets on and stepped into the hallway. Jacob carried the body of the third diving suit, I carried the helmet, and we made our way towards the control room, hoping Captain Cameron would be in there. The plan was to find Captain Cameron, and get the word out around the ship that the thing could only hurt you if you looked into its eyes.

We still weren’t entirely sure what happened if you looked at it, but what we had seen so far was disturbing enough that neither of us wanted to try. I followed Jacob through the ship, as he led us away from the screams, taking a more circuitous route to the control room as we avoided the shambling creature.

When we arrived at the control room Captain Cmaeron beckoned us in with a relieved look on his face. There were eleven crew members crammed into the small control room, and once we joined them we were officially at capacity. We handed Captain Cameron the diving suit and explained the plan.

He nodded, looking grim, and said, “That’s better than risking any one else’s safety. How about I lead the creature towards the exit hatch as a distraction. You two just get over there safely and wait. Novak will watch the cameras in there and release the hatch once you three and the creature are safely inside.” He gave us a pitying look. “I wish I didn’t have to put you two in so much danger, but I don’t see another option.”

Jacob and I both nodded resolutely and I said, “It was my decision to bring this thing on board, I want to do what I can to make it right.”

Jacob put his hand on my shoulder and said, “I was involved with that decision too, and I second this one. Let's fix our mistake.”

Captain Cameron nodded, slipped into his diving suit, and the three of us stepped into the hallway. Jacob pointed to the right and then at Captain Cameron and nodded, then pointed to the left and gestured for me to follow him. 

We made our way down the hall, towards the exit hatch. It was a sealed, pressure controlled room that we could use to come and go for specimen collections. It was also exactly big enough to hold me, Jacob, and the creature. 

The few crew members we passed, we warned about what was happening, and told them to hide somewhere safe and keep their heads down. I was starting to get nervous about the number of people we had sedated in med bay now. I don’t know exactly how many people it takes to run a submarine, but with people dropping like flies we had to be down to the wire.

It wasn’t long before we could hear scraping and shuffling coming down the hallway towards us. Captain Cameron rounded the corner, walking backwards with his head down. I glanced at Jacob and realized that if the thing pursued Cameron instead of us we would never be able to get rid of it. I stepped away from the doorway and put myself between the creature and Captain Cameron. 

It didn’t break stride, but when Cameron shuffled off to the side it didn’t change course to pursue him. I took over, walking backwards, until I made my way into the isolation room. It shambled after me, but didn’t stop when I put my back against the wall. It kept moving towards me until it had me pinned against the exit hatch. 

I kept my eyes down but called out, in a shrill voice laced with panic, “Jacob? It’s got me pinned.”

Just as I finished speaking I felt a hard slam, and glanced up just enough to see the creature reeling back, before slamming its head into my helmet again. I watched in terror as a small spider web appeared in the glass. The creature put its hands on either side of the helmet to hold me in place just as Jacob was able to open the hatch behind us. Water rushed in and the creature was sucked out into the inky blackness. I had been able to get a good look at its hands before it was sucked out, and my stomach sank with dread. I was almost certain the suit was stitched from human skin.

Even with that fresh panic, I was thrilled, gravity and physics took care of the problem for us. Then a leathery hand reached back inside, wrapped itself around my ankle, and yanked me into the cold dark ocean. 

Despite our depth I could tell a storm was raging above us. The water would briefly light up with a lightning flash, revealing the tide battering everything in its path on the surface. I could only see the creature when the lightning would flash, but I could tell it was trying to get back to the submarine, with me in tow.

I fought and kicked, trying to get away, but the grip it had on me was inhuman, making all my struggles to get away seem meaningless. I was about ready to give up hope when I saw something come down on the creature's hand. Jacob had found a large rock, and brought it down on the wrist part of the suit. 

It weakened the things grip just enough for me to get away, and I crawled backwards. In the momentary flashes of light I could see Jacob fighting to get away and I began searching for a rock too.

I could see the spider web in my helmet growing, and I knew it wouldn't be very long before the pressure would break through and drown me. I found a medium sized rock and fought against the water pressure to lift it. At some point Jacob got free from the creature and helped me lift the rock, and together we carried it to where the creature was pinned by the rocks Jacob had been able to grab, struggling to free itself. 

We dropped the rock on it's sternum as the lightning flashed, illuminating the things eyes, just as I looked at them. 

Instantly I was transported somewhere else. It was a sunny day in November, unusually warm and bright and I walked down a hospital hallway. I was moving slowly, even though the nurses had called to tell me to hurry. I had been scared. I knew my mom was close and I wasn't ready to say goodbye. I think part of me had hoped that if I never got to the room, I would never have to see her die.

In a sense I was right. I didn't have to watch her die, because she had already passed when I got to the room. The nurse said if I had only been one minute earlier I might have been able to say goodbye. 

In the memory I sank to my knees in the doorway of my mom's room and began weeping. I felt a hand on my shoulder and turned around, expecting to see a doctor, but instead I found myself looking right into the face of the diving suit.

When we made eye contact I was plunged again into a memory. This time I found myself kneeling at my dad's grave side as my mom sobbed beside me. It was the moment I had known I would lose my mom as well, one of the most painful days of my life. 

Again I felt a hand on my shoulder, but this time I looked down, saw the human leather glove, and closed my eyes tight.

I felt the creature turn me around, could feel it's face inches from mine, but I refused to open my eyes. I could feel it's rage radiating out from it as the hands moved from my shoulders to my sternum, and began tearing my chest cavity open. The fingers sank into the soft skin and tissue between my breasts, biting through the meat of my flesh and wrapping around my bones. I could feel my rib cage bending and instinctively opened my eyes as I screamed. 

I was instantly plunged into another memory, this one from the time I had dealt with a stalker in college. But this time I was ready, and as soon as I felt the creatures hand on my shoulder I bolted. 

I ran through the hallways of my old college, until it faced into the green and grey of the cemetery my parents were buried in. I forced myself not to falter as I ran past my crying mother, the creature still shambling after me. 

The cemetery faded until it was replaced by the hospital, and I continued to run despite the burn in my chest and arms. I reminded myself it was a dream, a hallucination, but the terror remained. 

After what felt like years the hallway faded into black, and I woke up.

When I woke, I was in a regular hospital bed, Marnie was in the bed next to me, the curtain between us pulled back. Her face looked drawn and tired, older than I remembered. I took a moment to get my bearings, then pressed the call button for a nurse. 

A nurse wearing light purple scrubs walked in, and lifted her eyebrows in surprise when she saw me. 

She said, “Oh my god, you're awake! This is incredible, let me call your doctor.” 

She rushed over and did something on the computer next to me, took my vitals, then ran from the room. She entered a few minutes later with a doctor in tow. They fussed over me for a while and gave me a little information, but I got the real story from Captain Cameron when he arrived. 

Captain Cameron, or Nate as he told me to call him, told me what had happened. He said that Jacob and I had just managed to pin the creature when I had fallen to my knees and begun sobbing. Jacob carried me back to the submarine and put me in the isolation chamber. When they opened it, I was there and catatonic, but Jacob wasn't. 

They weren't sure exactly what happened to him, they think he got grabbed by the creature, or maybe it was starting to get free and he ran back to stop it. Either way, Jacob had sacrificed his life to save mine. They hadn't been able to recover him.

As soon as the creature was securely trapped, the storm had calmed and what was left of the crew had taken the submarine back to the surface. It was a hard journey, apparently the storm had been a rough one, and on a skeleton crew it was extra hard. Apparently by the time we had gotten the creature off the ship, a total of forty-one crew mates had been affected by it.

Those of us who had been affected by the creature were taken to the hospital, and according to Nate, only a few of us woke up. I was among the first group to wake up, and even now almost six years later eight of those people are still catatonic. I take responsibility for every single one of them. 

Marnie woke up eventually, and even though she said she didn't blame me for what happened I was still removed from her team. That's okay, I'm not as interested in the ocean as I used to be. It turns out, the ocean hides some secrets for a reason.",593,0.98,24,abiroadwrites,2024-11-06 23:53:01,1gljpk0,617,High
NoSleep,Museum Files of the Arcane: The Warden's Glass,"The package was heavier than I expected. It sat on the worktable in front of me, wrapped in a layer of brittle, brown parchment that smelled faintly of mildew and old varnish, with a wax seal—red, chipped, official-looking—stamped on the front. *For the attention of Magdalene Driscoll,* written in the small, careful script of someone who doesn’t want their name connected to this delivery. I traced the address with my thumb, feeling a prickle of excitement.

The museum was quiet, colder than usual, with that familiar smell of dust, varnish, and the ever-present tang of metal from the displays around me. All around, cases of glass and steel stood like silent, forgotten sentinels in the dim light, each one filled with relics of another age—half-melted candle molds, tarnished sextants, peculiar tools that looked like they’d been assembled from spare parts in someone’s attic. I heard the creak of the floorboards settle and imagined the exhibits behind me listening as I worked.

A message from Tamsin had arrived earlier that day, her voice crackling over the line as if her words were being dragged through static. Tamsin held a Ph.D. in Industrial Archaeology, specializing in 19th-century mechanical innovations and esoteric technology. Her research focused on unconventional inventors who operated on the fringes of Victorian science, particularly those whose inventions blurred the lines between science, art, and the occult. She liked to call it ""studying dead men’s toys,"" which never failed to annoy purists.

""Hey, Maggie! Just wanted to give you a heads-up,"" Tamsin had said, sounding more animated than usual. ""Remember that inventor we talked about—Winslow? Well, guess what? A journal of his just surfaced, full of sketches and notes on his inventions. I thought of you right away! It's on its way over now—you’re going to love it.""

I’d laughed it off then, but now, sitting alone with the package, I felt a sliver of apprehension. The stillness pressed in as I peeled back the parchment, revealing an old leather-bound journal underneath, its edges worn and cracked. I ran my hand over the cover, which felt almost soft, as though it had been handled by a hundred hands before mine.

The first page crackled as I opened it, and a musty, almost sweet scent puffed up—a mix of faded ink, dried paper, and something else, something metallic, like old blood. My fingers tingled as I turned the page, and there, in thick, dark strokes of ink, was the name: *Ivor Winslow, 1829*.

A thrill ran through me. I’d heard of Winslow, that much was true. Unlike the textbook names of other inventors, though, Winslow was known only to a select few—a shadowy figure referenced in half-forgotten papers and obscure footnotes among those in the field. Tamsin and I had laughed over rumors of his work—devices that supposedly let you “see beyond the veil,” things people claimed let you peer into other realms, glimpse spirits. It was all nonsense, but this… this journal made it feel solid, real. Winslow’s words sat heavy on the page, a warning as much as an invitation.

***Journal Entry, 7th February, 1829***

*At last, I have refined the diagrams for what I now denominate The Warden’s Glass, a contrivance designed to unveil the hidden substrata beneath the human countenance; to pierce the common veil and afford a glimpse into the architecture which, I am convinced, courses beneath the surface of mortal flesh. This apparatus, if assembled to the precise specifications I have delineated, may permit the wearer to behold not merely the tissue of our corporeal form but that elusive quintessence which lingers therein, half-visible yet wholly inscrutable.*

*The device itself demands the placement of two primary lenses—one convex, one concave—set within a brass frame that holds them at a separation exact to a quarter of an inch; such a distance has proven critical, for without it, the apparatus serves merely to magnify the mere superficies, yielding naught but an ordinary amplification. My initial trials, I regret to note, yielded only this, much to my chagrin; I shall not soon forget the unfortunate episode involving the dissection of a housecat, whose secrets were, alas, not laid bare by the preliminary lenses.*

*Further, I have introduced a third lens, set obliquely, and treated with a thin coating of silver nitrate—a substance which, I surmise, shall act as a filter for those more spectral elements which lie dormant to the unassisted eye. This treatment, I hypothesize, shall lend to the viewer a rarefied perception, one that transcends the bounds of mere organic scrutiny and hints at the immaterial. I have yet to comprehend fully the nature of this spectral substratum, though in prior observations, I have beheld faint vapours—fleeting emanations—particularly around those in the final throes of life, and, in one instance, upon a cadaver but hours deceased.*

*Yet, even as I commit these particulars to paper, there emerges within me a sensation not solely of elation but of something altogether more severe, as if some primeval warning lingers at the fringes of consciousness. The phrase, To see what lives beneath, haunts my thoughts incessantly, suggesting more than mere flesh or sinew; it alludes to an uncharted realm that may lie upon the precipice of the observable, awaiting its own dreadful unveiling.*

*There remains upon this very page a faint smear, left from an earlier accident in the course of the experiment; it is a smudge of blood, thin and dried, mingled with the residue of silver nitrate—a token, as it were, of the very boundary I seek to cross. Blood, yes; yet blood is but the beginning, the primal fluid from which my investigations must spring, leading me down that path where substance yields, finally, to essence.*

*To-morrow, I shall resume these trials, urged forth by a conviction both unrelenting and yet laced with apprehension, as though bound by some spectral thread; it tugs, invisible yet undeniable, drawing me onward into shadows where no man has ventured and whence no man may return unscathed.*

I turned the page, feeling the brittle edge scratch lightly against my thumb; a faint itch surfaced at the bridge of my nose, and I scratched it absently, my eyes falling once more upon Winslow’s neat, precise script. The ink looked darker here, almost oily, sinking into the parchment with an unsettling intensity. The next entry lay before me, waiting. I took a steadying breath.

***Journal Entry, 15th February, 1829***

*The apparatus, now augmented with certain modifications, has yielded the most extraordinary results; indeed, what I have observed may strain credulity, yet it must be recorded with the utmost fidelity, for the sake of both science and posterity. Upon this day, I dared to engage The Warden’s Glass upon a human subject—none other than myself—and thus set forth to test whether my theories held substance or were mere phantasmagoria borne of fevered ambition.*

*At first, there was naught but an unsettling disquiet, as if I had peered through a dense mist; shapes appeared, nebulous and indistinct, floating at the periphery of vision. I adjusted the lenses with trembling fingers, aligning them precisely; a curious vertigo ensued, a spinning sensation, brief yet palpable, as though I had plummeted from some great height within my very soul.*

*Then, as the vertigo subsided, I beheld—oh, how shall I describe it?—an apparition, not wholly human, but a shade of myself, clinging to the contours of my face, my hands, my form; it seemed a dark mirror of flesh, pale as death, as though some ghastly double had emerged from within, lurking beneath the skin. There were my eyes, yet hollowed and glistening with a malign intelligence not my own; there were my hands, twisted and elongated, as if stretched by unseen forces to an unnatural shape. This other self regarded me with an expression so dark, so hideously knowing, that a thrill of terror ran through my frame.*

*Yet, the spectacle did not end here; the vision grew stranger, still more grotesque, and I perceived upon my limbs faint trails—pale, winding veins—pulsing not with the warmth of blood but with a thin, sickly light; it traced across my skin as though some inner fire burned weakly within, struggling for release. These veins converged upon my heart, which throbbed visibly beneath the Glass, as if yearning to break free of its bony cage. Indeed, I swear I saw it, my heart itself, beating with a sickly rhythm and tinged with a hue I dare not name; it seemed a creature alive unto itself, malicious, hungry, and ever-watchful.*

*Such was the horror of this vision that I was compelled to tear the Glass from my face, lest I descend fully into madness. My breath came in short, gasping bursts, my hands numb with fright; it was as though I had glimpsed some heretofore hidden world, one that exists beneath our every waking moment, unknown to us, and yet profoundly, horribly real.*

*I write these words with trembling hand, for I know not what next I shall uncover should I continue these trials; yet I am driven by a force I scarcely comprehend, an unquenchable thirst to understand the dark inner workings of our being. There is something—some force or essence—that dwells within each of us, some shadow-self that lurks beyond perception, ever present, and I am determined to unearth it, though it cost me my reason, or my very soul.*

*Tomorrow, I shall endeavor to increase the refractive power of the lenses, to deepen the magnification, and perhaps unveil that which lies even further beneath; for there are layers upon layers yet unexplored, and I feel compelled to venture into these unfathomed depths, however treacherous they may prove.*

*May these notes serve as testament to my efforts, and as a warning to any who may follow; for there is, I suspect, a price to such knowledge, one that has already begun its dark toll upon me.*

I checked my watch—10:42 p.m. Just about time to pack up, call it a night and head home. That was the logical thing to do, of course, but the thought came and went like smoke, barely registering. I was stuck here, rooted to the spot with the journal practically pulling me in. The brittle pages caught the dim light in a way that dared me to leave it unfinished, to abandon Winslow and whatever strange things he’d uncovered. Instead, I turned another page, my pulse picking up.

My eyes landed on his sketches, meticulous and exact. He’d drawn out the *Warden’s Glass*—lenses sketched in sharp detail, measurements scrawled along the sides like the work of a man in a hurry. Below were lists of chemical compounds he’d tried, with a line or two about their “effects on perception,” in a mix of English and Latin that seemed to straddle the line between science and something close to mysticism. 

**Tinctura Salis Nitri**

* **Description**: A tincture derived from purified *sal nitrum* (saltpeter), thrice distilled in a copper alembic; proportioned as 3 drams saltpeter to 1 drachm copper. Purported to “steady the pulse and prepare the nerves for heightened vision.”
* **Dosage**: 12 drops, administered upon the tongue ere the handling of the *Warden’s Glass*.
* **Observation**: “Observed upon trial—a mild clarity of thought, yet tingling persists at the extremities. Requires further refinement.”
* **Latin Notation**: *Per visum maiorem, sed cum tremore* (For greater sight, but with trembling).

**Vapor Mercurii Sublimati in Vinum Plumbum**

* **Description**: A mist derived from calomel (mercury chloride) vapor, suspended in lead-infused wine at a ratio of 2:1 (wine to calomel); believed to “illuminate hidden recesses within the flesh.”
* **Application**: Inhaled sparingly ere observation. Caution advised, as mercury’s influence upon the constitution is known to be deleterious.
* **Observation**: “First trials reveal a subtle brightening in perception, though a dull ache ensues. Mild unease follows.”
* **Latin Notation**: *In corpore visio, tenebrae patent* (In the body, vision opens to shadows).

**Pulvis Lapidis Philosophi, admixtus cum Oleo Absinthii**

* **Description**: A powdered facsimile of the *lapis philosophorum* (Philosopher’s Stone), created through pulverizing native sulfur with oil of absinthe in a ratio of 3 to 1. Purported to sharpen the mental faculties to an extraordinary degree.
* **Dosage**: A small pinch upon the tongue, not to be administered more than twice per fortnight.
* **Observation**: “Immediate effect—awareness heightens, with a ‘second sight,’ though evanescent; faint illusions present to the mind.”

Winslow’s notes showed a fervor that bordered on obsession; he outlined doses, mixtures, ratios, specifics so precise they were almost unnerving. The parchment held dark stains—residue from his experiments, or maybe just the ink reacting to the years.

Then I hit the next entry, and immediately, the tone shifted. The ink was darker, almost pressed into the paper with a weight that practically dripped frustration—or fear. I took a breath, feeling a chill creep up my arms, and read on.

***Journal Entry, 22nd February, 1829***

*It is with great dismay, mingled with some measure of indignation, that I pen today’s account, for my recent revelations concerning the Warden’s Glass have met with scorn and derision among those I once counted as both colleagues and friends. The very mention of my observations—the vision of that dark being, that infernal double I beheld through the lens—was met with laughter, outright mirth, as if I were a common charlatan recounting tales of phantoms and spirits to gullible children. Even Dr. Abner Hollis, whom I had regarded as a mind of singular curiosity, dismissed my findings as fanciful delusion, urging me to “rest” and “let the fever pass.”*

*There is but one, Mr. Roderick Elwood, whose ear was inclined toward my words with more than passing interest; indeed, he listened as I recounted my ordeal with a silent intensity, his gaze fixed, thoughtful, as though he too had once glimpsed into some dark crevice of the soul. Mr. Elwood, a fellow student of optics and physiology, is a man of sober mind and unyielding curiosity; he has spent many years in the examination of light and refraction, often proposing theories both strange and inspired, yet rooted always in science and logic. At my behest, he agreed to come to my laboratory, to view himself through the Warden’s Glass and see if my account held merit.*

*Upon his arrival, I noted a strange solemnity upon his countenance, as though he approached some sacred rite. I placed the Glass in his hands, noting with satisfaction his careful grip upon the device, his movements precise and respectful, for he understood the nature of invention, of risk. When he at last held the lenses before his eyes, I waited, scarcely daring to breathe, as he peered into his own reflection, his gaze unwavering.*

*Yet, as the moments passed, his expression remained impassive, unmoved; indeed, his features betrayed no trace of horror nor recognition of that shadow-self I had glimpsed so vividly. At length, he removed the Glass and regarded me with a bemused smile, expressing no horror, no dread, but instead a mild disappointment; he claimed to have seen nothing untoward, nothing to suggest the “revelations” I had described with such fervor. He suggested, perhaps too kindly, that my vision had been the product of fatigue or nervous excitation, and recommended I abandon the apparatus for a time, lest it lead me further astray.*

*This revelation—this failure—has left me at once baffled and resentful, for it suggests that the Glass reveals not to all but only to certain eyes, or perhaps certain souls.*

*I am loath to abandon my inquiries, for in them I sense some deeper truth—a truth both terrible and irrevocable. Tomorrow, I shall proceed with another trial, perhaps upon a third party or upon some creature devoid of reason, that I may discern whether this apparition is unique to me alone. Let this entry serve as both testament and warning, for should my findings reveal some singular corruption within my person, I know not what end awaits me, save one of horror.*

I really should’ve been heading home by now; this journal wasn’t paying my overtime. Winslow’s journal had me in a strange grip, as if the lines of ink themselves were threads, winding tighter and tighter around me. I pulled the lamp closer, allowing the warm pool of light to spill across the worn pages, and I turned to the next entry with a growing sense of anticipation.

***Journal Entry, 24th February, 1829***

*To any who might follow my steps through these pages, let this entry serve as a testament to the precarious and beguiling path upon which I now tread. Today, I conducted my latest trial with the Warden’s Glass, and I am yet shaken by the result, unable to decide if the vision I beheld is truth or some horrid delusion crafted by a fevered mind.*

*Having resolved to test the apparatus upon another, I enlisted the company of Mr. Leopold Grant—a figure of some notoriety within the town and not unfamiliar to those versed in local gossip. Accused, albeit never convicted, of unspeakable acts against a woman and child, Grant remains a shadowed presence in our community, a man cloaked in accusations, though no judge’s gavel has ever fallen against him. Despite his standing, I confess a fascination with his intellect, for he speaks with an eloquence that belies the baser rumors surrounding him; his discourse is, in fact, often compelling, with insights that I might describe as mordant, even penetrating, if not for the faint whiff of arrogance which always accompanies his speech.*

*Mr. Grant is a man of many convictions, particularly in matters of social order and the so-called ""rights"" of mankind. He regards the world, as he put it in our discussions today, as “a vast tapestry wherein each thread is not woven by man, but dictated by nature’s own hand.” A peculiar view, yet I found myself reluctantly compelled by his arguments, for he spoke with such fervor on the inherent hierarchy of all living beings, on the natural superiority of the “enlightened few,” that for a moment, I found myself nodding in unthinking assent. It is a view, I must admit, that grows more common in our age—this conviction that certain men are fated for greatness, while others are destined to serve. Such beliefs disturb me; yet, in Mr. Grant’s company, I confess I felt strangely willing to listen.*

*It was with no small sense of foreboding, therefore, that I handed him the Warden’s Glass, knowing his nature but curious to observe if he, too, might glimpse his inner form as I had. I prepared a dose of Tinctura Salis Nitri, administering twelve drops upon his tongue precisely as prescribed. He accepted the tincture without protest, though I noted his lip curled slightly at the bitterness; still, his gaze remained fixed upon the Glass with a peculiar intensity, as though he anticipated some spectacle or revelation unique to himself.*

*At last, he held the lenses to his eyes, his features poised in cold anticipation. I watched him carefully, scarcely daring to breathe as he peered into his reflection, his gaze unwavering, his form statuesque, and his lips set into a thin line of contemplation. The silence stretched between us, thick as a shroud, and I waited for some flicker of recognition to pass over his face.*

*But it was I—not he—who beheld the horror.*

*Through the Glass, I caught sight of his reflection, twisted and blackened, a shadow-self that I dare scarcely describe; for in his visage I beheld not mere flesh, but a mask of malice, as if his inner being had warped his features into a grotesque semblance of humanity. His eyes, dark as pitch, seemed to absorb the light, drawing it inward to feed some monstrous emptiness within; his mouth curled into a smile, but it was a grimace of hollow triumph, a sneer stretched tight as if over bone. The flesh about his throat bore dark lines, winding like chains, as though some inner violence had left its imprint upon his very spirit.*

*I struggled to remain calm, to keep my face impassive, though every nerve in my body urged me to recoil. Mr. Grant lowered the Glass, glancing toward me with a faint expression of curiosity. “Is all well, Mr. Winslow?” he inquired, his voice low and untroubled. For a moment, I stood rooted to the spot, fighting the urge to confess the vision that had chilled me to my marrow.*

*But no words came. Instead, I forced a smile—weak, strained—and assured him all was well, that the Glass was simply an instrument, nothing more. He seemed satisfied with my answer, his mouth twitching into that familiar, unsettling smirk as he handed the Glass back to me, remarking idly that he “had hoped to see something truly remarkable.”*

*And thus, I let him go, saying nothing, betraying nothing, though my mind shrieked with horror at what I had beheld. I should have told him, should have confessed my vision, for he deserves, at the very least, to know the depths of his own corruption; yet, perhaps cowardice or some lingering fascination stayed my tongue. Even now, I cannot shake the image from my mind, nor can I fathom why the Glass should reveal such horrors to my eyes alone.*

I stifled a yawn, rubbing my eyes and reminding myself that any sensible person would’ve left hours ago. But here I was, still anchored to Winslow’s strange, unsettling world. I’d gotten used to this, I suppose—staying long after everyone else had clocked out, losing myself in archives and journals, just as I’d done back in grad school. My old study partners used to make fun of me for it, always the last one hunched over some musty old book while they grabbed drinks. But they’d gotten lazy after a few years; most of them were happily cataloging exhibits or doing desk work now, their curiosity worn down to a dull nub. Maybe I wasn’t exactly Miss Popular, but if that’s what they thought it took to be “likable,” I didn’t care.

I flipped to the next page, feeling the spine shift strangely beneath my fingers—a bit heavier than the rest, a peculiar thickness at the back that I hadn’t noticed until now. I pressed a little, thinking I’d feel something odd beneath the leather cover, but nothing seemed amiss. Just the pages and that sense of old weight, dense and ominous in a way I couldn’t quite explain. Maybe it was just my mind playing tricks on me, tired as I was, but it felt like the journal itself was pressing back, heavier somehow the deeper I got into Winslow’s entries.

Leaning into the lamp’s glow, I turned the page. The flicker of the light seemed to make the ink shift on the page, as though his words were still wet, fresh and almost alive. I took a breath, pushed my glasses up my nose, and read on, drawn in by that same strange, nagging pull.

***Journal Entry, 10th March, 1829***

*A fortnight has passed since the night of Mr. Leopold Grant’s visit, and I find myself gripped by an unease that no science nor rational philosophy can dispel. The Glass, in its cold and indifferent clarity, has revealed a dreadful truth—one I had, until now, successfully cloaked in the comfort of denial. Leopold’s visage, that foul, contorted shade I glimpsed, was no fleeting mirage; it was, I am convinced, a manifestation of his true essence, made visible to me alone.*

*Yet, how did I fail to heed the warnings? The rumors of his alleged misdeeds have lingered about him for years, staining his reputation like a faint shadow one might dismiss in passing, but which clings persistently to the air. There were whispers of a woman, a child—of lives cut short by a silent hand and buried by the cruelty of indifference. He eluded judgment, defended by technicalities and the absence of witnesses, and emerged unscathed in the eyes of the law. And here I was, deceived by his charming eloquence, his wit, even his mind, so coldly rational yet disturbingly vibrant. It sickens me to think that I too might have been charmed into silence, lulled into complacency by my own foolishness.*

*No longer, however, will I rest on such foolish conceits. I have devised a plan to expose the truth, to force this revelation upon the eyes of others who, like myself, have failed to see the wolf among us. I shall host an evening gathering at my own residence, an affair of unusual festivity; and I shall invite a select company—those men and women I deem most respected within our society. This will be a congregation of the learned, the curious, and those of firmest moral standing, for I must secure witnesses of unquestionable judgment; only then can the weight of Leopold’s corruption be laid bare for all to behold.*

*I shall prepare carefully, extending invitations to each guest with utmost discretion, lest the nature of my purpose be misconstrued. I have chosen them with utmost care; there is Dr. Abner Hollis, once a friend, whose skeptical eyes may lend credence to the spectacle I shall unveil, though he regards me now, I believe, with disdain. There is Mrs. Lavinia Crawley, a woman of high social standing, outwardly prim yet keen for the private scandal; perhaps she will delight in the unmasking of our mutual friend. Mr. Edward Salloway shall be among them, a man of inflexible conviction and a strict adherent to logic, whose presence shall serve as a bulwark against any claims of exaggeration or hysteria. And there is Miss Eleanor Finch, an artist of prodigious skill, whose temperament is both studious and unafraid, a woman with a keen eye for shadow.*

*The invitations have been sent, and I have taken pains to craft them in a manner both cordial and mysterious, hinting at a grand spectacle which might arouse their curiosity. Though I am seldom one to host gatherings, I trust that the unusual nature of this event, combined with their intrigue in my scientific pursuits, shall draw them here.*

***17th March, 1829***

*The night of the gathering has come and gone, and I am yet in a state of agitation, a turmoil so profound I scarcely know how to order my thoughts upon this page.*

*They arrived in finery, exchanging pleasantries in the candlelit corridors of my home; I greeted each with cordiality, concealing the quiet dread that gnawed at the edge of my mind. Leopold was among the last to arrive, sauntering in with that insufferable air of familiarity, as though he and I were kin of the closest order. He clasped my hand, a broad, arrogant smile spread across his face, and I felt a shudder seize me, an impulse to pull away, to banish him from my sight; yet I smiled, swallowing the disgust that welled within me.*

*Wine flowed freely, and soon laughter and the low hum of conversation filled the rooms; yet beneath it all, a tension simmered, invisible to all but myself. I waited until the hour was late and their spirits sufficiently loosened before making my suggestion—that we adjourn to the lower chambers where my laboratory lay, for I had “a marvel” to show them.*

*They laughed, teased me as expected, yet curiosity won out, and they followed, descending into the dimly lit room where my apparatus awaited. The laboratory was arranged with deliberate care: the Warden’s Glass rested upon a velvet-draped pedestal, surrounded by vials and tinctures whose oils glimmered faintly in the gaslight, casting shadows that flickered against the walls. I had prepared the room as one might a stage, each object meticulously placed, each light angled to create an atmosphere both scientific and foreboding.*

*One by one, I offered them the Salis Nitri, observing with satisfaction as each obligingly took a measured dose; I administered the preparations carefully, precisely as before, knowing that any deviation might compromise the outcome. As each guest took their turn peering into the Glass, I noted with relief that their reflections remained untainted, their forms unchanged; they laughed, finding nothing to remark upon save for a faint dizziness from the tincture’s effects.*

*Finally, it was Leopold’s turn. Yet no sooner had I extended the vial than he declined, laughing as he waved it away. “I have tasted your draught once, Winslow,” he jested, “and I see little need to subject myself again.” His voice, dripping with casual insolence, made my blood pound hotly, yet I forced myself to maintain composure, coaxing him with gentle persistence. He continued to resist, and the others began to laugh at my insistence, though I sensed a flicker of hesitation in his eyes—a trace of something that only deepened my resolve.*

*Before I could press further, a clumsy guest—young Mr. Pettinger, the son of a local magistrate and entirely inebriated—stumbled forward, declaring his eagerness to try the experiment once more. His heavy hand caught the edge of the pedestal; the Glass, my creation, my only means of revealing the truth, toppled to the floor with a sickening crash. In an instant, it shattered, shards of glass scattering across the stone, reflecting a dozen fractured images of my horrified face.*

*Rage surged within me, a torrent so fierce I feared it might consume me utterly. I scarcely remember how I ushered them out, my voice tight, my gestures sharp and unkind. Leopold gave me one last smirk as he left, a look that seared itself into my mind, mocking me, taunting me with the knowledge he had escaped yet again. As the door closed behind the last of them, I stood alone in the darkened room, staring at the remnants of my work, a hollow emptiness settling within me.*

*Yet beneath the emptiness, a darker impulse stirs, a heat that I cannot ignore. I find my mind drifting to thoughts of vengeance, to the image of my hands wrapped around a throat, squeezing, feeling the life drain slowly away. I see it as clearly as I see the room before me: Leopold’s face, contorted in shock, in pain, in horror as I exact upon him the justice he has evaded for too long.*

I closed the journal with a slow, steadying breath, feeling that prickling chill on the back of my neck, the kind that keeps its hold long after the lights go on. Winslow’s words were a trap I was willingly stepping into, deeper and deeper with every page. My shift had ended ages ago—but the idea of going home felt so…trivial. The museum was empty, quiet, and as always during these hours - rare as they are besides occasions such as this one - I liked it that way. The silence wrapped around me like a wool coat, somehow making Winslow’s twisted little world feel all the more real.

I got up, stretched, and wandered down the dim corridors, looking at the exhibits I’d walked past hundreds of times without a second thought. There were glass cases of polished brass instruments, faded maps, and fragments of machines that once hummed and clanked in some distant past, their usefulness as dead as their makers. Some pieces reminded me of that strange mix of people you meet in school—the ones who can’t leave the past alone, whose lives revolve around dusty artifacts, more comfortable with objects than with people. I’d been one of those, too. Still was, I guess.

I thought about the things Winslow had written, the strange way he seemed so formal, so poised, even while talking about horrific things. And yet, the cold detachment didn’t make it any less unsettling; if anything, it made him sound even more unhinged. Like he saw the world through a lens the rest of us weren’t privy to, and that lens wasn’t showing him anything pleasant.

Funny, though. The more I read, the more I could almost understand him. Winslow was someone you’d see wandering the library stacks at university, the one who barely looked at you, who muttered to himself like no one else was there. I’d known people like that. Hell, I’d *been* people like that. Lost in their work, their little pockets of esoteric knowledge, and wrapped so tightly in themselves they couldn’t connect with anyone else. Not that I’d had a huge circle of friends to begin with. They’d called me abrasive, prickly, or “too blunt.” Like that was somehow my problem.

But I’d never cared for the small talk, the endless cups of coffee over gossip about professors or breakups. Too many of them were just waiting for life to get started, like there was some grand event right around the corner. I’d found comfort in the straightforward nature of things like this museum. Artifacts don’t disappoint; they just…are. Just like Winslow’s journal, fixed and constant in its quiet horror.

I wandered past an old brass astrolabe, its darkened surface polished smooth by god knows how many hands, and caught a glimpse of myself reflected in the glass—a little older, maybe, and definitely tired, but the same me that stared back at people a little too directly. 

My mind wandered back to Winslow’s “*Nitre Tincture*” and the mad certainty in his words as he described his plan. The image of his guests in the cold light of his laboratory, not knowing they were about to witness something…something awful. I could almost picture him, adjusting the Glass with one hand, trying to hide his disgust for Leopold with the other. The man had ambition, I’d give him that. And even though he was bordering on deranged, there was something satisfying in seeing him out to prove everyone wrong. That sense of triumph over the ones who doubt you, who turn up their noses at what you know.

After a while, I made my way back to the journal, a little clearer, ready to get lost in it again.

***Journal Entry, 29th March, 1829***

*The deed is done; there is no turning back now, and I write this account with hands steadied by grim purpose. Leopold Grant is dead—by my own hand, and by methods as precise and deliberate as any experiment. I have, at last, silenced the monster within him, though I am aware that in doing so, I may have awakened the same within myself.*

*I encountered him alone, in the shrouded hours between night and dawn, when the streets are silent and only shadows bear witness. I had observed his habits with meticulous care; he often took solitary walks at that hour, basking, no doubt, in the certainty of his impunity. I had prepared my tools—the tinctures and powders that would ensure a swift yet undeniable end, items familiar to my hand but now turned to a darker purpose.*

*Approaching him, I offered my cordial greeting, concealing within it the cold malice that had festered in my heart. He returned my address with that same smugness, that insufferable smile; and yet, even as he spoke, his words rang hollow to my ears. I felt as though the world had narrowed to the beat of his pulse, to the delicate arch of his throat, to the faint gleam of his breath hanging in the air. There, under that shadowed lamplight, I pressed the vial to his lips, insisting it was a draft to ease “the malaise of the spirit.” Ever arrogant, he accepted it without question, swallowing my poison as if it were merely another trifling amusement.*

*The effects were swift, as I knew they would be; his eyes widened, his hand clutched his chest, and he fell to his knees, gasping for air that would no longer serve him. I watched, transfixed, as he convulsed, the once-powerful limbs now twitching feebly, his voice reduced to a mere whimper. The darkness consumed him, and I observed each stage of his passing with a dispassion that frightened me more deeply than the act itself; it was as if I had stepped beyond mere morality, into a realm where justice was the only law.*

*I write these words not from guilt, for I feel none, but from a strange, lingering satisfaction. I have succeeded where the law and society failed. Let this entry stand as testament; he has paid for his sins in kind, and I, though damned, feel a purity in my actions, as though I have struck a balance between the shadows of this world and the light.*

I dropped the journal, my hands suddenly cold, trembling as if I’d touched something forbidden, unholy. Winslow’s words echoed in my mind—a confession. Cold-blooded, calculated murder. This journal wasn’t just a record of experiments; it was his dark, twisted diary, and I’d just read his final, damning entry.

As the book hit the table, something slipped out from between the pages, landing with a soft thud. A flat object, wrapped in parchment. So that’s what had been causing that strange weight shift. I hesitated, heart pounding, before reaching for it. I slid it out from the parchment, cautiously peeling back the layers as it began to glint under the light—a piece of glass, clear but with an almost unnatural shimmer.

Then it struck me. This wasn’t just any piece of glass. It was *the* Glass, a shard of Winslow’s infamous *Warden’s Glass*. Somehow, he’d saved a fragment, hidden it here. But why? He’d never intended for the journal to be found, or did he? Was this some deranged message left for anyone who might stumble upon it? A tool for... what exactly?

As I held it up, the glint caught my eye, refracting the light, casting odd reflections across the walls. I squinted, adjusting it, when something shifted in the glass. I blinked, my mind insisting I was seeing things, but there it was—a faint, twisted image staring back at me. My own face, but… wrong. My features were there, yes, but warped, malevolent, a grotesque reflection filled with a cold, wicked intelligence that wasn’t mine.

I gasped, dropping the glass instinctively; it sliced across my finger as it fell, and a sharp sting brought me back to reality. I watched in silence as a single drop of blood slid down my fingertip, hitting the table with a soft splatter. My breath hitched, relieved it hadn’t splashed onto the journal, as though preserving Winslow’s final words mattered more than the thin line of red beginning to stain my skin.

For a long moment, I just stood there, staring down at the shard on the floor. That face I’d seen—had it been my imagination? Or had Winslow left this glass behind intentionally, some silent invitation to see what he’d seen?",28,0.93,2,aaron__47,2024-11-07 14:42:56,1gm0kzq,30,High
NoSleep,I’m being told to leave my apartment.,"I moved into my new apartment 10 days ago, after landing a new job that pays enough to warrant this crosscountry change.  I’m in a new city where I don’t know anyone; I’m brand new here, and things are already getting weird.

I need to know if I’m going crazy - this has to be some distasteful prank, right?  I feel like I'm going insane. 

My new apartment complex can be classified as “high end”. I’m definitely not used to living in this kind of “privileged” environment, but I quite like it. It’s a gated community, with a security guard in the entrance booth 24 hours a day.  Every street, parking area, and sidewalk are always well-lit.  The Community Center has a gym and “club house” with all sorts of amenities.  There’s a sizable dog park that my Chance (a 2 year old Lab mix) already loves. Even the dog visitors are well behaved.

Everything is normal and not threatening. Which is why I keep thinking I’m making myself crazy here.

I’ve had a few “run ins” with a tenant that are increasing in severity. 

On my 2nd night here, I took Chance for a walk around the complex; he only feels at home after he sniffs, smells, and pees on everything. So I was giving him the chance to do just that.  Everyone I encountered was occupied in their own business.  Some had headphones on. Others were on the phone. Families chatted on their evening walk. All except an old and wiry lady.  I felt her gaze well before our paths crossed. From about 30 meters away, I felt her eyes lock onto me.  I met her eye line, was taken back by her disturbing look, and turned back down towards Chance.  Her eyes were wide, bloodshot, and unblinking.  Under most circumstances, her look would be almost comical, with her eyebrows wrinkled her forehead with how elevated they were, and her eyes were wide enough you would think she was trying to keep from falling asleep.  Except she was walking directly at me. You never notice a person’s walking rhythm and cadence until you encounter someone like her: He took steps of all sizes at varying speeds, making her seem intoxicated. 

As we crossed paths, Chance, being his usual self, approached her; but she never broke eye contact with me.  It was as if the 75 pound goofball wasn’t slobbering at her feet.  She continued walking, staring at me, shaking her head slightly.  Her blood shot eyes were those of a terrified person, begging for blinking lubrication.  

At our closest proximity, she whispered “Get…Out” in an airy and raspy tone, as if struggling to find air to breath.  

I pulled Chance closer to me and walked away, pretending to have not heard her or noticed her peculiar demeanor. 

That was the first one, but the threats, warnings, whatever you want to call them, only have become worse.

On the 5th night, I was in bed, reading with my bed stand light on.  Chance slept at my feet.  I was deep in my book, but the sudden silence created by the absence of Chance’s snoring caught my attention. I put the book down and noticed his head was cocked towards my bedroom door.  He huffed and puffed suspiciously, as if wanting to alert me with a bark, but being unsure of what was going on.  He jumped onto the ground with the clumsy and ungraceful thump of a Labrador, and exited my room.  Instantly, he was barking wildly.  I ran to see what was going on.  The possibility of any sort of danger never crossed my mind - this was a very “nice” complex.   I found Chance pawing and scratching, unaware that a note had been slipped under the door.  I picked up the folded message, and this time, I got a little more information.

“GeT oUt.  hE IS cOmiNG foR yOu.”

This actually made me chuckle.  I read about people writing in a mixture of capital and lowercase letters to add a spooky factor to their message in books, but I had never encountered it in real life.  I pretended not to notice the fact that there were a few brown streaks that resembled blood throughout the paper.  I folded it and placed it in the trash.  I returned to bed, still warm and cozy.

If it were just these two instances, I would have dismissed them. I definitely do not have that special element that allows people to believe in the supernatural. But what happened tonight has me doubting my intuition.

An hour ago, at approximately 2AM, Chance repeated the same alerting routine.  He plopped out of bed, waking me up, and ran to the front door.  I got up very groggy and stumbled out.  I half expected another note of the sPoOKy nature, but there was nothing there.  Chance scratched at the door, barking aggressively.  Without thinking (my brain was still in bed asleep), I opened the door to find the same wiry lady that I encountered on my first night.  Except this time she looked fully psychotic, distraught, and potentially injured.  Her clothes were drenched, as if she had been submerged in water. They highlighted how skinny she truly was, hanging onto her like a scarecrow.  She was covered in something thick - maybe mud - that clumped her thin hair.  Her eyes were the same, wide, red, and unblinking. She had light cuts around her arms, neck and face.

Her voice - I must have dreamed this - didn’t quite register in my brain.  It was as if two voices were coming out of one mouth, one voice was extremely high pitched - almost inaudible -  and the other extremely low pitched, like a rumble.  But it still remained raspy and airy, as if she had just sprinted up the stairs and was out of breath.

“Get out…He is coming for you…” She said.

I stood staring at her, my brain barely getting out of bed.  My first thought was of the security guard at the entrance.  Surely security here is tight.  As if reading my mind, she added,
“Get out…before it’s too late and they don’t let you leave anymore..He is coming for you.”

Instinctively, I shut the door on her. Chance continued barking for a few minutes. He then determined the threat was gone, and crawled back into bed.  I sat next to him, in shock.

 I’ve been staring blankly at the floor and couldn’t do anything else other than write this.

I’m crazy for feeling any sort of fear, right? Surely it’s just one - assuming the note came from her - crazy lady freaking me out.  I don’t know what to think.",312,0.97,42,PleasantNightLongDay,2024-11-06 19:53:51,1glfgkv,354,High

There’s this little coffee place by work that I liked to stop at before my shift- Conner’s Cafe. It’s quaint, cozy too, with a good rustic vibe going on and dim lighting. For some reason, it also reminded me of home. Chicago. Probably why I frequented there so much. That, and they gave me a good discount when I wore my blues.

The staff were all genuinely friendly and welcoming to me too. The coffee itself didn’t taste half bad either, so I quickly became a regular. Maybe a little too regular given the events that were about to occur.

The bell chimed above the door as I entered the shop. It was pretty empty in there. Gauging by the state the dining room was in, the morning rush had just cleared out, granting the employee’s a bit of respite before the inevitable lunch rush.

“He did it!” The barista manning the counter shouted at me with wide eyes, pointing to his co-worker behind him. I’d come in wearing my uniform.

The accused looked at me like a deer caught in headlights before dropping the stack of cups he’d been holding in his hands and booking it to the back.

A smile spread on my lips as a soft chortle escaped me. My cheeks pinked up immediately and I covered my mouth in embarrassment, giggling something fierce. The barista joined in with a hearty laugh as he bent down behind the counter and picked up the discarded cups.

The rabbit, his name is José. Don’t worry, he didn’t have any active warrants out for his arrest or anything, he just went out back to take his smoke break. Albeit in a very dramatic way.

The kid behind the counter was Noah. He was young, in his early twenties. He looked like an E-boy with his singular earring and that mop of curly brown hair atop his head, which usually covered up his brown eyes. In addition to his uniform green apron, Noah wore a headband with fuzzy wolf ears on them accompanied by a pair of fingerless gloves with paw pads drawn on the palms. Draped around his shoulders was a fake sheep’s pelt. He’d dressed up as a wolf in sheep’s clothing for his Halloween costume. *Clever.*

“Aren’t you going to get in trouble for wasting all those cups?” I asked, stepping up to the counter to order.

“Nah, it’s fine,” he answered, chucking them in the trash bin, wiping imaginary dust off his hands. “Our seasonal cups are about to come in anyway, so these ones won’t be missed. What can I get for ya, miss? The usual?”

“Yeah, but could you add two shots of espresso please? I’m going to need it.”

“Ooh four shots of expresso, huh, what’s the occasion?”

I covered my mouth, yawning. “I’m working a twelve hour shift today. Twelve to twelve.”

Noah pressed his lips into a thin line, sympathizing with me. “Oof, yikes. I’ll get that coffee right out for you then. Wouldn’t want you to be off your game today, officer.”

“Thanks Noah,” I called out to him as he walked over to the espresso machine, “‘preciate it!”

A second later, he came back, placing my large cup of steaming hot supercharged coffee on the counter. I went to pull out my wallet to pay, but Noah waved me off. “It’s on the house,” he said with a glimmer in his eye and a dopey grin.

I smiled back, shrugging my shoulders and picking up my drink, not saying no to a free coffee. That’s when I noticed something written in sharpie just above the paper sleeve. The note read: *Will you go out on a date with me?*

My gaze flashed from the cup, to Noah, then back to the cup again. He stood there patiently, smiling like a puppy, eagerly awaiting my response.

“Oh, uh,” I let out a nervous laugh, gripping the straps of my purse for dear life, “no.”

The smile fell off of Noah’s face as he looked down at me, heartbroken. I didn’t want to kick the puppy, but I had to.

“I-it’s not you,” I blurted out, awkwardly waving my hands at him. “You’re great, really. A little young, but great! What are you, like twenty, twenty-one? You’re like five years younger than me!” I sucked a gasping breath for air. “It me, that’s the problem. You don’t want to date me. All I do is hurt the people that get close to me. I don’t mean for it to happen, it just does. But, yeah Noah, you’re great. Awesome, even! Best barista I’ve ever had, truly.”

As you can see, I like to word vomit when I’m uncomfortable.

Not giving him any time to rebuttal, I whipped my wallet out of my purse and haphazardly threw a five dollar bill across the counter, then ran out the door- all while abandoning my coffee in the process.

Great. Now I can never go back and show my face there again. That’s what I get for getting too comfortable. Should’ve known my safe place wouldn’t stay safe for long, *stupid.*

Guess I’ll just have to suck it up and stick to a certain chain coffee shop with a mer-person on the logo.

Now that I’m thinking about it, is their mascot a mermaid or a siren?

*Ugh.* The thought of sirens sent a shiver down my spine.

My throat is feeling a lot better, by the way. It’s still stiff and is a little bruised, but at least I can fully turn my neck again. Being able to keep my head on a swivel is pretty vital for the job after all. Never know when something might jump out at ya.

When I got to the precinct, everyone on our side was bouncing off the walls it was so hectic. Officers were bringing people in left and right. Our holding cells were packed full, the intake line stretching across half the precinct. Every time someone answered the phone, dispatch had a new incident for them to respond to. And as soon as the phone hit the receiver it would just ring again.

I set my things down on my desk, eyeing the coffee machine like a hawk. If I were going to survive this shift, caffeine needed to be flowing through my veins. Since it was Halloween, we had no clue which calls *actually* pertained to the supernatural and which ones were just humans being human. So that meant we just had to respond to *all* of them.

As soon as I stepped towards the kitchen, Dustin appeared out from nowhere and dashed all my hopes of acquiring a pick me up. “Rookie!” He called, slipping an arm through his black police jacket. The other followed and he adjusted the fabric so it rested comfortably on his broad shoulders.“No time for dilly-dallying, get in the car. We got ghouls to catch!”

A hefty groan left my mouth. I shuffled my feet forward a couple inches, my hand outstretched towards my lord and savior: coffee. Dustin called out to me again, causing me to flinch. With another huff and groan, I turned away from the source of my vitality and followed Detective Davidson out to his vehicle. I knew then that it was going to be one of *those* days.

Dustin wasn’t lying by the way. We’d been called out to a report of someone at the graveyard disturbing the graves. The groundskeeper caught the perp as he was sucking the intestines out of an old woman who was about to be lowered into the ground. After hearing that, it wasn’t hard to figure out we were dealing with a ghoul.

We classify ghouls as a type of vampire since they feast on flesh and blood, but mostly of the dead variety. You can think of ‘em as vampiric zombies. The classification is mainly because ghouls die just the same as regular vampires. Decapitation works best in most cases, but a wooden stake to the heart could do the trick too.

Here at WPD the last thing we want to do is end the life of a supernatural individual. Just like for us humans, supernaturals have the right to go to trial and let The Court decide their fate. Though, we are extensively trained to neutralize any threat if absolutely necessary, especially if that threat poses immediate danger to a human life.

Unfortunately, it was looking like that would be the case for this ghoul.

The groundskeeper had managed to detain him, but not unscathed, sustaining a gnarly bite wound on his hand. That’s when he called Winchester 911 and asked for an officer out to help him.

Getting that taste of fresh blood was like a shot of adrenaline for the ghoul. If he got loose, there was a very real possibility he’d kill the groundskeeper and eat until there was nothing left. Once a ghoul eats a live victim, the dead just don’t taste as good to them anymore.

We got to the graveyard just in time. As Dustin and I left his car, weapons drawn, the ghoul escaped from the groundskeeper’s binds and was trying to strangle him to death. The ghoul was an older, redneck looking man. His skin was pale and caked in dirt, human tissues, and viscera. The smell of death radiated off him.

“Help me!” The groundskeeper called out to us in a choked gasp.

Not wasting any time, Dustin drew his crossbow and aimed a wooden stake at the ghouls heart. I tensed, the groundskeeper was keeping him from a clear shot. The stake whistled as it soared through the air. My eyes clenched shut.

They opened again when the ghoul let out a ghastly cackle. Dustin had missed, hesitating with the shot at the last second because of the groundskeeper’s position. The stake had landed in the bark of the oak tree behind them.

The ghoul laughed, tilting his head back and unloosening his jaw. Leaving his neck exposed as he prepared to take a bite out of his next victim. Thinking quickly, I grabbed the crossbow from Dustin and reloaded. A sharp breath withdrew from my chest as I squinted my eye and pulled the trigger. A stunned gargling noise came from the ghoul’s throat as a the wooden stake embedded itself into his trachea.

The ghoul released the groundskeeper in its state of confusion. Relieved, he ran far away from the redneck and towards Dustin. This left the creature wide open. I unsheathed the machete I’d brought and ran up to the ghoul as he clawed at the wooden stake in an attempt to remove it. I didn’t give him the chance to. I kicked the piece of wood deeper into his neck. The sound of his spine cracking rang out as he stumbled into the tree, right next to the stake Dustin had fired. The momentum of my next swing enabled the blade of the machete to slice through his neck in one smooth swoop.

The red neck’s body fell limp as the head landed on the ground with a wet *thump*!

“That’s what ya get for eating Mrs. Patty, bitch!” The groundskeeper laughed, dancing around the ghoul’s corpse. Dustin cleared his throat and shot a stern look at the groundskeeper. Feeling the chill of Dustin’s iconic icy cold glare, he stopped, a serious and more adult expression returning to his face.

“Not a word, got it?” Dustin commanded.

“Y-yes, sir. You don’t gotta worry about me,” he answered. Davidson gave the man a sturdy nod. The groundskeeper didn’t stay long and quickly skedaddled, leaving us to clean up the mess.

“Nice one, rookie,” he said proudly, patting me on the shoulder.

I gently slid his hand off of me. “Thanks.”

After dropping the ghoul’s body off at the morgue, we were called out to investigate reports of a supposed ghost terrorizing the elderly residents in a subdivision on the other side of town.

The perp wasn’t the ghost of an ancient serial killer like dispatch had advised, but a kid dressed in *very* convincing ghost makeup. I swear special fx makeup is on a whole other level these days, because when I first saw the kid I was convinced he was a real ghost too. His skin looked pale, glassy, and if I looked hard enough, translucent. The face makeup made his eyes look real sunken in and sickly.

Turns out the kid was going around tp’ing these individuals houses and banging on their windows because he had some sort of vendetta against them from last Halloween. Apparently, these old geezer’s had handed out raisins and vegetables instead of the good stuff.

Since the delinquent was so young, we let him off with a warning. The looming dread of his mom’s fury as she calmly talked over the phone was punishment enough.

Speaking of warnings, one of the calls we responded to was at the residence of one of the local witches. Her name’s Marge and she’s a real sweet old lady. Something really bad must’ve happened if we were called out to her place. Dispatch had told us that someone had apparently been transformed into a cat?

When Dustin and I pulled up, Marge was sitting on a rocking chair on her porch, arms crossed tightly in her chest. A teenage girl stood in the driveway crying, holding a razor scooter in one hand and a fuzzy black kitten in the other. In front of her lay another razor scooter and a pile of baggy men’s clothes. A giant bloody skid mark was left on the pavement.

“What happened here?” Dustin asked, trying hard to hide his amusement.

“That *witch* turned my brother into a cat!” The girl angrily screamed, seething at the old woman just chilling on her porch.

“What’s your side of the story, Marge?” I asked, treading carefully up towards the woman. I didn’t want to run the risk of upsetting her and getting whimsically transformed into an animal like other the kid did.

Marge pressed her lips into a thin line and started rocking. She looked down at the blood stain solemnly. “He ran over my familiar with that damned scooter. It’s only fair he takes its place.”

After hearing both sides of the story and deliberating on what to do, we let both parties off with a warning. The boy’s sister wasn’t very happy that her brother wouldn’t be returning home, but I had to explain to her the grave mistake her brother had made by killing the witch’s familiar, even if it had been an accident.

She stormed off, learning a valuable lesson in that the next time she rides her scooter to be careful of her surroundings. Otherwise she might just find herself with new feline features.

As for Marge, Dustin allowed her to keep the  boy as her familiar, but warned that next time she’d have to go through the department and get a permit first. If she didn’t acquire one, we’d have to come and take them away, which nobody wanted.

We’d just gotten back into the liftback when we were summoned once more.

“Uh, could we get someone out here with us? This is turning out to be a bit more than we can handle,” Unit 217 called out over the radio.

Dustin and I checked their location on our map. We were the closest ones to them in the area. I looked at him, my eyes pleading for a break. We’d been responding to call after call for the better part of seven hours by then. I still hadn’t had a cup of coffee and something in my gut told me this one was going to be a doozy. He just smirked and shrugged his shoulders.

Asshole.

Dustin reached for the radio on the dashboard. “380 to 217. 10-4, can you give us a little more information? Let us know what we’re walking into.”

“217 to 380. We responded to a domestic dispute call and have the husband detained in the bedroom, but it’s gotten pretty weird over here. There’s something *wrong* with this guy. We need backup, just in case.”

Dustin let out a sigh and shot me an annoyed look.

“Told you,” I mouthed, sassily.

He rolled his eyes at me before responding back, “Standby, we’re on our way.”

When we arrived at the house, the sun was just setting beneath the horizon. Trick-or-treaters were out in full swing. Nosey kids and parents watched as Dustin and I met with the officers in Unit 217 on the porch.

An angry yell sounded from somewhere within the residence, the lights out on the porch flickered in response. A blonde middle aged woman came out from the open front doorway. She looked distraught and on the edge of tears. Her cheek was bruised, her upper lip was busted, and strangulation marks lined her neck.

“We’re so glad you’re here,” 217 said as the woman looked at them, pleadingly.

“You guys are good to go. We got it from here,”Dustin said, dismissing our counterparts. He shot me a glance, using his eyes to ask me if I was thinking what he was thinking.

The slight smell of rotten eggs clung in the air and the lights flickered again. Sharply, I nodded my head.

Unit 217 looked relieved as they retreated back to their patrol car. Two hardened and experienced cops like that looking so scared made me uneasy.

Of course we’d get stuck dealing with a demon of all things on Halloween, the one night a year where they’re at their strongest.

The girl introduced herself as Ginger Farley, the wife of the man 217 had detained inside. Harlen Farley. She’d called 911 after managing to lock herself in their bathroom before he could beat her to death.

Ginger initially flinched away when I reached out a supportive hand. After flashing her a sympathetic smile, knowing all too well what she was going through, she let me gently rub her shoulder comfortingly. “Can you show us where your husband is, Ginger? We’d like to check on his condition.”

“H-here,” she answered, shakily, “in the bedroom.” Ginger shot Dustin a weary glance and fiddled with her hands nervously, still blocking the doorway. Given the situation, it was normal for her to be feeling intimidated and scared by another male’s presence.

I stepped in front of Dustin and nodded, reassuring Ginger that she wasn’t alone and I’d be there to protect her. Hesitantly, she stumbled deeper into the house, still a little disoriented from her encounter.

The Farley house was a quaint one story ranch with a wrap around porch. The inside looked frozen in time, stuck in the 1970s. Dream catchers hung from the walls and hippie paraphernalia lined the shelves. A groovy Indian blanket was draped over a tan leather couch in the living room. The broken remains of a bong littered the floor, an overturned coffee table accompanying it.

Ginger slowly followed the path of destruction leading from ground-zero in the living room, through a short hallway, and into the master bedroom.

As we passed through the door, an overwhelmingly dark and overpowering aura filled the room. It was suffocating.

“Look what the whore dragged in!” A sickly looking man called from the bed with a wheezing laugh. He’d been handcuffed to the  bed frame of the couple’s water bed, one hand outstretched to each side. Yup, a friggen water bed. He sat spread eagle making it even harder not to laugh. The sight was so bizarre. Guess that’s Halloween for you.

Dustin and I shot each other curious glances. “Promising,” he muttered to himself, rubbing his thumb on his chin. Without proper confirmation, we had to operate under the assumption this man was himself and not under any sort of supernatural influence. Even with the signs we had observed, more tests needed to be conducted.

Us in the Supernatural’s Division rarely come across demon possession cases, and when we do, our job is to make sure what we’re dealing with is in fact a demon and not a really strong poltergeist or something else. After a positive ID is made, procedure states we wait with the possessed victim until we can get a priest out for an exorcism.

Dustin pulled out his emergency vial of holy water and started flicking water all over the potentially possessed man. Ginger stared at him dumbfounded. We hadn’t told her what we thought we were dealing with.

“Oh ow, no stop, that hurts,”Harlan said sarcastically in a mock whining tone as the water hit his skin. He then burped, the stench of sulfur emanating from his mouth. Though he was acting all tough, his skin had become red and irritated. And if you listened close enough faint sizzling could be heard.

Dustin made a non-committal noise as he pulled out his field notebook and started taking notes. I was just about to walk out and retrieve our state issued Holy Book and cross from his trunk when Harlan scoffed, tugging on his handcuffs, becoming clearly agitated. “You’re one of *them* kind of police officers, huh?” He asked, trying to sit up. He sounded annoyed.

Harlan then turned his head and looked directly into his wife’s soul. With a blink, the sclera in his eyes disappeared as his pupils blew up, leaving nothing but inky blackness. “Is this what you wanted to see, officer?”

“What the hell?!” Ginger screamed, grabbing onto my arm and squeezing the life out of it. The demon possessing Harlan let out a particularly nasty laugh, sounding like multiple voices talking at the same time.

Talking with our eyes again, Dustin gave me the go ahead to speak with her outside the room while he made the proper arrangements for her husband.

In the hallway, I endured a round of Ginger’s frantic questioning before conducting an impromptu interview of my own.

“T-two weeks ago, Harlan lost his job at the factory,” she began after I’d asked when she first noticed a change in Harlan’s behavior,” being replaced by a cheaper and more efficient automated system crushed him. He didn’t cope with it well, turned to the bottle instead of me. Harlan was real down, depressed and angry. So angry. He’s been going to the bar every night and a couple days ago he came back *darker*. He hasn’t been himself since. Then today-“ her voice hitched in her throat, causing her to pause. “Now it’s all starting to make sense…”

I grabbed Ginger’s hand and gently guided her back into the living room, kicking the broken glass and debris aside for her. She stifled a sob as she sat on the couch.

“Why don’t you stay out here for a while?” I proposed, sitting down next to her. “It’ll be safer this way.” With a tearful nod, Ginger agreed.

“Where’s the skank?” The demon asked as I re-entered the bedroom alone.

“Away, safe from you,” I answered, crossing my arms into my chest, leaning against one of the walls.

He scoffed, jerking his head my way. One of the bedside lamps flew across the nightstand, shattering into bits right by my feet. I stifled a jump by pretending to yawn, trying to show him he didn’t scare me.

“So, ya gotta name, demon?” Dustin asked, rolling up his sleeves, making himself comfortable. It was All-Hallows Eve, that meant we were going to be waiting a while for an exorcist to show up.

The possessed man spat at his feet, causing the waterbed to jiggle furiously. He laughed, “Not one that I’ll tell you!”

My partner did not look as amused. “Demon Dan it is, then.”

Demon Dan shrugged his shoulders, taking a liking to the name. Then, without warning, Dan turned his head towards me.   “Lucyyyyyy\~ you’re a bad girl aren’t you? A *very* bad girl!”

“H-how did you-“

“I’m a demon, girl, it’s my job to know these things!” Demon Dan hissed. He jerked his head back towards Dustin, yanking on his restraints harshly. “Dusty-boy, do you wanna know how she got her nickname?”

He shot me a nervous glance.

Dan then sang, “It’s because she’s lucky, *lucky to be alive!*”

“Hale, what’s he talking about?” Dustin asked, looking back and forth between us frantically.

“D-don’t listen to him, he’s a demon. He’s trying to get inside our heads!” I reminded Dustin.

In a panic, he retrieved his vial of holy water once more, dumping it over the demon. Small streams of smoke billowed off his skin. “You’re getting too rowdy for my liking. This outta shut you up for a while.”

A horrific wail escaped from Demon Dan as he violently convulsed. After a couple minutes of agonized gasps and groans, he seemingly settled down.

“Okay,” he said breathlessly in a serious tone as his eyes went dark, “playtime’s over.” A harsh metallic groan filled the room as Demon Dan broke through his handcuffs like they were nothing.

“Shit,” Dustin mumbled, stumbling back.

I pushed myself off the wall, looking around for anything that could be used as a weapon. I kicked myself for not getting the Bible and cross out of the car earlier. In his fit, Dustin had depleted his holy water supply, leaving us virtually unprotected.

“Why don’t you write this down for your little report, detective?” Demon Dan cackled as his back arched as an invisible force helped him slowly rise to his feet. Then, with a spectacular supernaturally aided jump, he clung to the ceiling like a cat. The sound of his feet padding around filled the room as he crawled around erratically.

“Me and this meat sack made a deal the other night,” with one hand still holding onto the ceiling, Dan brought the other down to his cheek, rotating it as he pouted his lip and mockingly cried. “He wanted to make sure his miss’s would be well taken care of.”

“So you possessed him?” I questioned.

Demon Dan smiled delightfully. “Did you know that Mr. Farley’s life insurance policy is worth one million dollars? He sure didn’t!”

Dustin bid in, “what does that have to do with possession?”

“Tsk, tsk, tsk,” Dan chuckled. “This coward would never end his life on his own. He needs someone else to do it for him! So, in exchange for a fun time with his wife, I would make sure she’d be set for life. Now it’s my turn to fulfill my end of the deal. Why don’t you say hi buddy, before you go?”

“No! No, no, no, please!” Harlan cried out, eyes going wide. Without Dan in control, he fell from the ceiling back first onto the hardwood flooring. A pained cry came from the man as many of his bones broke upon impact.

Ginger’s screams filled the house. Dustin and I turned around to find she had been peeking through the bedroom’s door, watching this whole catastrophe unfold. Seeing her broken husband’s dying body was enough to send her flying out of the house.

A gurgling sound came from Harlan’s throat as he coughed up blood. After the sound continued for a minute, I recognized it as a sinister chuckle. His eyes flickered from normal to pure black. Dan looked up at me and frowned. Harlan’s neck then snapped as it twisted to an unnatural angle, the frown turning into a sick smile. He flashed his blood red stained teeth. “There is no Heaven! There is no Hell! There is only darkness! Praise The Harbinger of Doom for they will bring darkness to us all!” He cryptically cried out with one final huff.

Demon Dan seemed to have left his host after that, leaving Harlan lying there broken and alone as he breathed his final breath, the light draining from his eyes.

We’d lost him.

“Fuck!” I shouted angrily, kicking the waterbed’s frame, causing the mattress to slosh around. I hadn’t wanted to go to the morgue for a second time that day.

Dustin tried to put a comforting hand on me, but I pushed him away. After letting me stew in self-pity for a moment, he told me to wait in the car. He’d call and cancel the priest and take care of the body.

After closing Harlan’s sheet covered body in the trunk of his car, Dustin drove us back to the precinct. The air was thick and heavy with tension. Something felt off. *Different.*

I confronted him about an hour before our shift was supposed to end. We’d been walking past the holding cells on our way to turn in the night’s paperwork. Passing by the last cell with its strategically opened door, I suddenly pushed my partner in. The door slammed shut behind him before he could even comprehend what was going on.

“Lucky? What the hell?” Dustin questioned, gripping and pulling on the silver bars frantically.

I stepped back cautiously.

He pushed and pulled even harder, staring at me like a caged animal. His look of shock turned into one of anger. In a rage he shouted, “What’s going on? Why am I in here?!”

My head turned away, unable to look at him. I couldn’t bring myself to say anything.

The rattling stopped. Then a beat. I forced myself to look at him. The pissed off look dissipated, leaving behind that same creepy grin I’d seen at the Farley house.

“Oops! Ya caught me!” Demon Dan giggled out, dropping the act. His eyes became two black abyss’s as the demon showed himself.

“Why are you possessing him?” I interrogated, my emotions enabling me to take a demanding step forward.

He shrugged his shoulders. “What can I say? I like it when you get all irritated and fired up.”

“You’re a bully,” I scoffed, tucking a stray piece of black hair back behind my ear, addressing the comment.

Dan bellowed out a laugh as if I said the funniest thing in the world. “No, I’m a demon, sweetheart. There’s a difference.”

“And why were you being so open about your intentions earlier?” I asked, changing the subject, “What did you have to gain from all that?”

Dustin’s eyes narrowed as he leaned his shoulder against the cell’s bars. “Nothing. I was just bored and you two were taking forever. I did find what I was looking for though, thanks for that.”

“Good, so you can leave.”

Demon Dan chuckled, crossing his arms into his chest defiantly. “And what if I don’t wanna?” He challenged.

I narrowed my eyes and seethed at the demon. “Get out of my partner, *now*,” I commanded. A strange feeling surged through my body then, causing my balance to falter just a bit.

The thing puppeteering Dustin’s body stepped back, holding his hands up defensively. “Whatever you say officer\~” he said with a smirk, flashing those black sclera-less eyes one last time. “See you later, toots.”

An evil laugh erupted out of Dustin’s throat as tears started to flow from his eyes. Then, in an instant, he stopped. His eyes were his again. “Hale, why am I in a cell?” He asked, confused.

“You were possessed,” I answered, opening the cell door for him. “Still might be.”

Then an intense wave of weakness and nausea overcame me. With the excitement of the day’s events over, the lack of caffeine and exhaustion had caught up with me. I stumbled to the ground, promptly passing out. My body felt like it was floating in water as my mind went blank.

I woke up lying on two office chairs that had been pushed together as a makeshift cot. Dustin was holding an ice pack up to my forehead, a thermometer sticking out of my mouth.

“Glad to see you’re back,” he chuckled after I spat the thermometer out and threw the ice pack on the floor. I gave Dustin the middle finger before he helped me up to my feet.

The fluorescent glow of the precinct’s overhead lights started giving me a headache. “What time is it?”

“Don’t worry, Halloween is over. And so is your shift,” Detective Davidson said as he helped me out to the parking lot. Outside, the early wisps of sunlight peeked above the horizon as birds started to chirp signaling the beginning of their hunt for worms.

Despite my protest, Dustin wouldn’t let me drive home. I kept reassuring him I was fine but he was not having it. With a promise to return my car to me, I reluctantly let him take me home.

Then that snitch told the Lieutenant about my fainting spell. I received an apologetic phone call from him, saying he felt bad to have forced me to come back to work so soon. Lieutenant Dawn then ordered me to take a mandatory week of leave to fully recover. He hung up before I could respond.

Today has been the first day I’ve truly felt able to do something since Halloween. I’ve expended most of my energy typing this out, but here’s my report for ya. And yes, of course I’ll keep you guys updated on what happens when I return back to the force.

I’ll leave you with this piece of advice: please, watch where you’re riding your scooters!",70,0.92,6,spnsuperfan1,2024-11-07 00:00:51,1gljtwb,76,High
NoSleep,The walk that wouldn't end.,"I recently turned 40, and I've had a pretty interesting life. Married, 4 kids and a stable career. Unfortunately during a check up, I was told I was overweight. Wanting to live to see my grandkids, I decided I'd do something about it. Everyday after work I traveled to a local nature trail. There I tried to walk at least a mile before going home. Between the serene sights of the forest and listening to music. It became a peaceful stroll i looked forward to everyday. After changing some eating habits, I was relieved to see the weight come off. But I wasn't finished, after losing twenty pounds I didn't plan on stopping. One day after work I once again planned to go walk. 

This time however, I noticed something different. A little ways down from the usual wooded path I took, was yet another trail. I hadn't noticed it before, but maybe it was new. I didn't see any signs or human activity, but I figured why not. A change of scenery might be nice every once in a while. So I put in my ear buds and began my trek. As I started, I couldn't help but notice a few things. The usual trail had signs pointing you in the right direction and a wooden track to walk on. This one was only a grassy path surrounded by thick woods. It was odd but I shrugged and kept going. 

With the oldies blaring in my ears, I was able to go over a mile. Now drenched in sweat and having a feeling of accomplishment. I was heading home with my head held high. While walking back, I failed to notice how deep I went. As the trail looked exactly the same. Getting tired, I was hoping that I'd see the end soon. But it just kept going, showing no signs of an exit. Looking up at the sky, I could see it was getting late. Feeling concerned, I pulled out my phone to call my wife and check in. Much to my chagrin, I had absolutely no cell service. With no other choice, I had to keep pushing forward.

I walked and walked till I was out of breath, but still no exit. I'd sit on the ground trying to catch my breath and figure out an explanation. I definitely don't remember walking this far, did I take another path? No that was impossible, the entire trail was a straight line! Maybe I got carried away and lost in my tunes. Perhaps I had a burst of energy and went farther than expected. So I stood back up and continued my trek back. I noticed the moon starting to become visible, giving the sky a dark blue glow. It wouldn't be long until nightfall and I definitely didn't want to be out here. I prayed that I'd see civilization again soon.

After what seemed like an hour, I was still out here! I was so tired and the path showed no signs of changing. Where the heck was i, why was this happening? I know I didn't walk that far, I'm almost three hundred pounds. Under normal circumstances I could've called for help, but not only did my phone have no service. It was now dead, the battery completely drained. It's safe to say I was beginning to panic. Here I am lost in the woods and now it's pitch black dark. I couldn't hear anything, I didn't see anyone…this was getting scary. But even though things were looking bad, cooler heads always prevail. So I glanced over at the woods next to me and got an idea. Since this path wouldn't end, maybe the forest would lead to an exit.

So I left the trail and started pushing through the thick brush. I could feel the briars sticking into my flesh and twigs cracking beneath my feet. I was so tired; praying that I was close to getting out of here. I wanted to go home and get something to drink, as well as explain myself to the wife. Just thinking about it gave me a sliver of hope. Unfortunately, I soon broke through the thick shrubbery. What I saw before me was the same path I had started on. The same path I had walked for hours, I was back on it. Now panicking like never before, I ran through the trees once again.

I don't know how, but maybe I got turned around while having to snap branches. Perhaps I just went in a big circle, regardless I was getting desperate. As I began yelling at the top of my lungs. Screaming out hoping that someone would hear me. I hollered until I was out of breath, I didn't hear anything in reply. I fell to my knees, feeling completely defeated. Something wasn't right, I didn't know where I was but it wasn't a nature trail. It felt like I was an ant trying to find my way out of a maze, like someone was toying with me. This was still earth right, not some gateway to hell?

My breathing got harder, this time out of sheer terror. I started to hyperventilate, swearing the woods were closing in around me. I wanted to see my wife again, my children…even my grouchy boss. I didn't want to die out here!! I stood up once more and slapped myself to fight the panic. I had to make it out, there was no other option…so I ran. I ran and didn't stop, tearing through the thorns and vines ignoring every sting. My heart was beating so fast, but I wasn't stopping until I found a way out. As the adrenaline flowed I forgot how exhausted I was. I kept coming back onto that godforsaken trail but I wasn't giving up. I closed my eyes and kept running, not letting even death knock me down.

After what seemed like forever, I ran into something hard. So hard that I let out a yell and hit the ground. As I opened my eyes, I was met with a ticked off policeman. He let out a pained groan before shining his flashlight in my face. As our eyes met, his jaw dropped. He quickly grabbed his walkie talkie and called for backup. The officer explained to me that I had been missing and my wife called them for help. When he told me how long I'd been gone, I nearly fainted. The man said that I had vanished for four days straight; and that my family was worried sick. He said that search parties had been formed and signs were hung up.

He told me they had started to lose hope before I ran into him. Back at the station I was reunited with my beautiful family. I hugged my kids so tight and gave my wife the biggest kiss. With tears in their eyes, they begged for an explanation. When I told them what happened, I could tell they didn't believe me. But seeing my cut up legs and sweat soaked clothes was a pretty good argument. The cops would even give me a breathalyzer test to see if I was drunk. When it came back negative, everyone was confused. Since my explanation wasn't winning them over, I decided to show them the trail. The next day my wife and two officers followed me to the path. I knew I wasn't crazy or a drunk, and they were about to find out.

But as we arrived, I want you to guess what happened. The path wasn't there, instead only thick woods. The breath left my lungs, I absolutely couldn't believe it. Where did it go, it was right here yesterday…what was going on? While I stood speechless, my wife and the cops gave me an odd look. My wife told me that I must've been tired; that my job was getting to me. She said I needed to take some time off and relax. But I shook my head and persisted, this couldn't be happening. 

What happened to me, where had I gone for all that time…nothing made sense. I was brought home and told to rest, everyone gave me sympathetic looks. As time went on things went back to normal, but I'd never forget. Something strange happened in those woods and I never got any answers. One thing was for sure, I ended up joining a gym like a normal person.",79,1.0,4,yohane66,2024-11-06 20:36:08,1glgadr,83,High
NoSleep,I know what happens when you die (Pt.2),"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fkfi0z/i_know_what_happens_when_you_die/)

The longer you're in a strange situation, the more your brain just numbs itself to the insanity of it. It was strange at first, waking up to sometimes see Rocky at the foot of my bed. His appearance was sporadic. He'd appear and disappear as he saw fit. The longest I recall him being gone was about a month and a half. I almost thought he had left for good. Maybe he went to heaven? Then he came back, as if nothing had changed.

After a time, it became weirder when Rocky wasn't around. I'd still see spirits, now and again, but I hadn't seen anything like Rocky since he came into my life. I kept him a secret from my parents. Coupled with everything that had happened, I thought I was an adult now at six and too old for an ""imaginary friend"". It's laughable what children think maturity is and to my younger self's credit, Rocky wasn't imaginary.

At the beginning, I merely tried to introduce him to my hobbies and interests. It was through this way that I found Rocky couldn't see electronics that well. He could make out movies, video games and TV shows, but he told me they were often muted and filled with static. When I tried to introduce him to video games, he just didn't comprehend it. ""A show that you play. It doesn't make sense,"". Board games he seemed to respond better to, though I'd have to read the rules and explain them.

It was a friday night that I finally asked about him, alone in my room when I should have been sleeping. Mom and Dad din't know, plus my door was locked. ""Where do you come from?"" It was a simple enough question, open-ended.

""I was like you.""

""You were a person?""

I flipped a card for Rocky. Pass go. I'd move his piece for him and place the money in front of him, though he didn't seem particularly interested. Rocky just seemed to enjoy being treated like a person as opposed to...whatever he was.

""Yes.""

""Do you remember your life?""

""I was a...person. I don't remember much of the before time. I remember that I was a...soldier. Yes. I did things. I killed people.""

My brow furrowed as I flipped my own card. Go directly to jail. Gross. I moved my piece. ""Is that why you're how you are?""

Rocky craned his head to better look at my eyes. He liked to make eye contact, even though he had none. ""It is a rule I found out about the after. When you kill, when you take a life personally, you become more like me.""

I stared at him. It was a heavy topic for a child, much more so with the frankness he presented it with. ""How do you know?""

""I've found others like me. I can smell when its close. When someone is close to dying. The smell...what's your favorite food?""

I moved his piece but I did so half-heartedly. My attention was elsewhere. ""I like pizza with onions.""

""Imagine that. But you haven't eaten in years. Imagine the smell. The aroma. So close. So delicious."" It was the first time I ever saw two slits open on Rocky's face, just above that mouth, a wheezing inhalation sound. ""You couldn't understand it. How hungry you get. How you'll do -anything- for it.""

My mind had finally linked what had happened with Mr. Raymonds. ""...But you only chase after bad people, right? Was Mr. Raymonds a bad person actually?""

Another wheezing. This one, however, was more of a laugh. ""No. I don't know. I don't care. I simply need it.""

I frowned. That wasn't a good answer. It was cruel and callous, even to a child. ""But you should only chase after bad people.""

""Life and the after don't care about such things."" Rocky's gaze locked harder with mine. ""Look at me. Understand me; Fairness. Justice. Morality. They do not exist. When you are in the after, you do what you need. You fight. You thrash. You eat. You survive. Because that is all there is here.""

It was times like this, looking back, I don't think Rocky truly grasped how young I was. I don't think he had known such words would bounce off a child's head. I only remember them now because of what would come after. ""What if you just...didn't?"" I'd ask, rolling my dice. Not out of jail.

Rocky wheeze-laughed again. His head tilted further down, twisting his neck until he was almost looking at me upsidedown. ""I need to eat. I need to.""

""But—""

""You know so little of this world. You know so little of my own. One day, you will understand.""

The room felt just a bit colder. I stared back at the board, playing my game which at this point was me moving pieces while he watched.

""Where do you go when I'm away?"" I asked.

""I search to fill the void.""

""And...uh...what fills the void?""

""Do not ask questions that we both know the answer to.""

We'd continue our game in silence after that, me moving pieces, just trying to enjoy myself. But the question lingered. Did it really take him that long to live? Was that his equivalent of chores? I didn't know. Looking back, I should have shooed him off then and there. But I didn't. I wanted to try and ""help"" Rocky. Whatever that meant. Maybe if he saw how I lived my life, he'd have a change of heart?

""Do you want to come to school with me?"" I asked.

A confused look, the tapping of knife-like fingers. ""I could.""

""It'll be fun if you do.""

""...I will do this. I will see how things have changed since I was in your world.""

I wish there was more to talk about. More hints, more things, but that was the thing about Rocky. He was an observer. A guardian angel, if you believe he was pure. A malevolent curse, if you don't. It was rather unnerving how normal that school day was. He didn't comment or say anything, he merely watched. The expression never changed: Passive confusion. An alien on the outside, watching acts and rituals. Nothing seemed to click. It finally occurred to me that...maybe Rocky was too far gone? Maybe Rocky had just let his mind wander away from what it meant to be like us? To be human?

The one brief note was that as we were walking to lunch, Rocky stopped. I didn't say anything and kept walking but he seemed to be drawn to another classroom. My school went from kindergarten to eighth grade, Rocky focused entirely on a history class watching what I think was a war movie. His head tilted to the side, breaking away from me as he went to look through the window.

Rocky would rejoin me later after lunch. It was during recess now and I was distracted playing kickball. Rocky followed me, watching children play, as I guarded the outfield. ""Did you see something that you remembered?"" I asked in a hushed whisper.

""Yes. Maybe. Possibly.""

""What was it?""

""A far away place. Blood. Fire. Noise. Hate fo—""

Rocky stopped what he was saying. Those slits on his face where his nose would be opened up, drinking the air of the after in deeply. A low, gutteral groan rippled from his throat, his words stopped. Every muscle on his body flexed, growing taut, his fingers writhing as he smelt something. ""Rocky?"" I whispered, confused.

He didn't respond to me. I don't think he even knew who I was. He dropped to all fours and began to sprint. It was exactly as I saw him when Mr. Raymond died; a wild, charging behemoth. The worst part of it all was how silent he was. That silence made it easy for me to hear the braying of something in the distance. The direction of which Rocky had begun sprinting towards. It was feasting time.

""IDIOT! THE BALL!""

I was so distracted that I hadn't noticed that the kickball had landed in my field, tumbling toward the direction Rockey had gone. Morbid curiosity overcame me as I saw it roll where he had gone, his mountainous form hunched over...something. ""Sorry, sorry, I'll get it,"" I called out, rushing to follow it. When others weren't looking, I'd subtly nudge it toward the treeline. Our school was on the very edge of a forest, with no fence to stop children. An oversight from the pre-millenium, to be sure.

The ball tumbled down into the forest's edge, just close enough to where Rocky was. I could finally see it then. The scene before me. It was the first time I had seen Rocky actually doing what he did as opposed to hearing from afar. In the physical world, I saw a dead body for the first time. A deer, freshly deceased. Nothing that would scare someone, unless they'd never seen a dead body before.

The spirit world, on the other hand, was a different story.

The blue ""body"" of the spirit was torn apart. I would have never considered such a sight could exist in the realm beyond life, yet here it was. The deer wasn't a deer anymore, having been rended apart with a brutal savagry my young mind could have never comprehended. Limbs sent in all directions, the body torn asunder. Yet there was a...softness to it. Already, that gore began to evaporate, disappearing from the world around it.

And there, hunched over the spiritual carcass, was Rocky. Shoveling pieces of of it into his blender maw, completely ignoring me. Gore shot out from his mouth, anything that wouldn't feed him staining the ground. Claws tore apart what remained, getting pieces that could fit. He gorged himself on whatever he could, ignoring me watching. Did he not care? Did he want me to watch? Or was that hunger so all-consuming that he couldn't be bothered to think about anything other than eating?

""Dude, what's taking so long!?"" one of my classmates called out, running up to me. ""...Woah, is that a dead deer!? GROSS!""

It was right then that I collapsed.

=========================================================================

I got to go home early after that. The guidance counselor recommended some time with me, see how I felt and if things could help. I'd have to visit them a bit considering I had such a strong aversion to what they thought was me seeing a dead animal. Maybe I was frail mentally, in their eyes, to the idea of mortaility. I kept my mouth shut. Nobody would believe me if I told them what I saw. If anything, they may consider me wrong. Having vivid, violent images in my head. It didn't take a child to know that the things you imagine tell a lot about your own mind.

Rocky followed me home, as he always did. I couldn't look at him. I think he realized, finally coming off of his binge of feasting, that he might have frightened me. Maybe he'd see my reaction and change his ways? I had hope he'd realize things were dire between us.

When I finally got to bed, alone in my room after a horrid day, Rocky just...stared at me. I couldn't read his expression, but it slowly dawned on me: There was no apology to be given. No remorse. Nothing. What looked back at me, across the edge of my room, was something that held no forgiveness. Why would it forgive what was normalcy?

""That was horrible, Rocky,"" I said.

""I told you. There is no fairness in the here nor the after.""

""You didn't have to be so mean.""

""Maybe not.""

""...Was that what you did to Mr.Raymonds?""

Rocky slowly clawed his way over to me, sitting by the bed parallel to me. ""I cannot stop. That hunger. That pain. I feel it all the time. I need it to stop. I need it to end. Even now, I am in agony. Talking helps me forget. But it never goes away. Be it napalm or be it a campfire, it's still fire. It's always there, burning me.""

""I'm sorry it's like that for you,"" I'd say.

""If I could stop, I would. But I don't act through hate or vengence or spite. I do this because I need to.""

The pity I had felt, the empathy, vanished. It dawned on me that Rocky was not something or someone that could change. Rocky was less of a person and more of a sentient animal, driven by food, driven by whatever he needed. I had let the wolf into my home and now it was there. But something else clawed at my mind. ""Rocky?"" I asked.

""Yes?""

""...If I died, would we still be friends?""

Silence. Complete, dreadful silence. It was almost as if for the first time, Rocky wanted to be picky with how he worded things. After that dead air, he finally spoke: ""Do you truly want the answer?""

Now it was my turn to be silent. I didn't want to know, but I knew. Nothing last forever. Nothing lasts eternally. One day, things die. In a way, my silence was my answer.

My knowledge about the after had once given me peace. Now it made me reconsider everything. I couldn't be near Rocky when I died. But what if there was an accident? What if a meteor fell on my house tonight? What if I got hit by a car? And what if Rocky was there?

The thing I had once considered my friend was now an omen. An ominous reminder. Always following me, always watching. I felt ill, I felt terrified. Existential dread, the thing I had believed I had passed, loomed over me now more than ever. Every day that passed, I was closer to dying. And Rocky would be there, waiting for me, whether I liked it or not. It's there that I realized that he was a sword looming over me. Could I get away from him? Could I escape him? No. He didn't need to sleep. Rocky could watch and wait, eyes locked on me.

I could never escape him. I couldn't run from him. He was a ticking timebomb. The day I would die, he'd be upon me. I felt nausea overcome me, dread, terror. He would always be there. Watching, waiting. Yet to him, he couldn't grasp my terror. To him I was just a friend. A friend he'd one day tear apart when the final breath escaped his body.

These were things a child shouldn't have to think about. Rocky watched me sit in contemplation, opting to join me in it. Those long, sharp fingers resting on boney knees as he'd stare forward.

I was so focused on myself that I hadn't considered death may come for someone else close to me.",81,0.98,3,CapnMarvelous,2024-11-06 19:41:36,1glf7q3,84,High
NoSleep,I'm A Contract Worker For A Secret Corporation That Hunts Supernatural Creatures... Be careful at the local bars. ,"[First:](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fz6zph/im_never_doing_door_to_door_sales_again/)

[Previous: ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gezwb6/im_a_contract_worker_for_a_secret_corporation/)

My hand had been slowly healing. Not being able to fully flex my fingers the first few days was a little annoying. I didn’t want to strain myself chasing down supernatural monsters until the tainted magic faded. Instead of monster hunting, I took some time to collect cans and bottles off the street in my neighborhood. I got a few judgmental glances. It got me out of the house and enough money to buy a loaf of bread and a carton of eggs. Plus, some trash got recycled. A win for everyone.  

Finally, a new request came in that sounded simple enough. I was surprised to find out August passed on it. He said he didn’t want anyone to see him hanging around in bars and assuming he was a bad parent who stayed out all night.  

There have been three disappearances in the past two weeks. All were male and each had last been seen at a certain bar. There were no records of them getting a lift home. The one who drove to the bar left behind his car. So far, he had not appeared again to claim it. Some cameras pointed to the front door, but none of the men were seen leaving. However, the front door isn’t the only exit. There is a chance they left some other way. Something like this normally doesn’t get on The Corporation's radar. A fourth man was found inside a bar’s washroom with his head missing. It didn’t seem possible for a human to remove the head, clean up, and leave without being seen in such a short span of time. That was when something supernatural had been considered.   

The job was simple. To act as bait to lure out anything that may be targeting men in the area. The Corporation would cover the bar tabs for food and nonalcoholic drinks. I heard there were at least three others who took the job ready to sit around in different bars in the area looking for signs of a predator. It seemed easy enough. I didn’t even need to fight the monster if I found it. Passing along info to stronger Agents was good enough.   

I didn’t want to wear my better clothing I was able to remove the security tags from. Thankfully my local thrift shop had a sale I spent some of my recycle money on. Sure, the clothing was a little worn and I could not get the thrift shop smell from them, but what supernatural monster would ever notice that?   

I hoped this job lasted a few days for the free meals. The first night was uneventful. I talked to some of the regulars and bought them some food on my company's dime. No one had noticed anything strange lately. The bar wasn’t overly busy, but I assumed that would change the next night. It was near a college so on Friday and Saturday nights it was normally packed regardless of the odd recent death in a nearby bar. From what I could tell this place was for normal humans to make bad choices. I wanted to wait through the weekend just to be certain.   

When the bar closed on the first night, I ordered a few extra meals to take home. And to give out some to the homeless men I saw hanging outside when I arrived earlier that night. Most of the time the homeless are the ones to see the first signs of supernatural creatures. Due to their situation, and what led them to their current lifestyle, most people wouldn’t believe them even if they went to the police with important information. Most of the time they never spoke up because they feared authority figures.   

Two gratefully accepted the food while one wasn’t pleased I didn’t offer him money. I asked them if they had seen anything strange lately. I was told me a few minutes before closing they had seen a man in a suit lurking around the alleyways. It appeared odd to them. I thanked them promising another meal tomorrow night if I was able.  

I tracked down the man they mentioned. Once I saw him poking around in the trash, I confirmed what I’d assumed.  

“I'm working on the same case as you. Find anything useful tonight?” I said causing the man to jump at someone suddenly talking to him.  

“Oh, no. Nothing, sorry. Are you an Agent as well?” He asked as he walked over towards me, slipping on some trash in the alleyway.  

He looked on the younger side. I never would have assumed he was an Agent fighting monsters at first glance. He had a smaller frame with a pretty face. One that reminded me of a Japanese ball-jointed doll. Honestly, his pale doll-like skin was almost creepy.   

“No, just a Contract Worker. I’m Richmond.” I offered my hand as I introduced myself.  

“I’m Agent Ito. Since we’ll be working on this together, let’s exchange phone numbers.”   

I pulled out my phone to get his number. He was friendly with a calming voice. An Agent like this wouldn’t last long in his line of work. He must be new. After exchanging numbers, he told me he was going to be at a bar two blocks away the next night. If I needed any help, I should text him. It was a nice feeling to know I had backup. I let him go on his way with a promise to take him up on the offer for help.  

I slept in the next day. Since I didn’t need to go out until later that night, I accepted a request from August to watch Lucas for a few hours. His washing machine was better than my own, so I babysat and did some chores.   

Things were too going well. That stressed me out. Call me paranoid, but I had a feeling of a rough night ahead of me.  

I was one of the first to enter the bar that night after babysitting. For hours nothing interesting happened. It got louder as more students arrived. I found a spot by the bar with a good view of the rest of the room. Every once and a while I looked off into the crowd looking for signs of magic. The strain on my eyes hurt like hell and I ended up giving myself a migraine. Being able to see magic and sometimes the past a human mask monsters wore didn’t help me get jobs done as often as someone might think. I couldn’t control the sight very well in such a large crowd. Most of the stronger creatures knew how to hide their powers even from my eyes. There was also a surprisingly large amount of harmless half-breeds. Some people weren’t even aware they had something other than human in them. So, someone with more magic than normal wasn’t a reason to be overly worried about.   

Halfway through the night, it was starting to look like a bust. A person sat next to me making it clear the night was going to get interesting. A set of blue eyes landed on mine. I found myself staring at one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen. Her long brown hair fell over her shoulders in waves. Her white turtleneck sweater was plain, but it didn’t need to be anything fancy. Her perfect features drew your attention away from what she was wearing. It took me a second to realize she had asked me to buy her a drink.  

I waved over the bartender and paid for one with my own money. The Corporation was only covering soda and juice. She thanked me with a smile that made me look away. When I looked back, I was once again caught by her beauty.   

“What's your name handsome? I’m Cameron.” She asked when her drink arrived.  

“Richmond.” I replied.  

My mouth felt dry just being around her. She gave another blinding smile that caused me to wonder if she was dangerous or not. You didn’t need special eyesight to see she wasn’t human. She was so clearly a hunter on the prowl.  

“What’s a guy like you doing in a college bar like this?” She pressed in a somewhat teasing tone.  

My job had worn down my features. I looked at least ten years older than I really was. A bar like this was a great spot for a creature to pick up easy targets. A chill went down my spine as I realized I might have come across the reason why men had started to go missing.   

“I’ll tell you if you can keep a secret.” I said as I lowered my voice.   

She leaned in, face bright and ready.   

“I’m keeping an eye on the bar for a good reason.” I started.  

“Is it because of the headless man in the bathroom a while ago?” She asked, face flushed with excitement.  

I focused on her reaction. Cameron looked happy to be talking with someone she thought to be a cop instead of fearful she would get caught.  Was she a man-eating monster or just a true crime junkie?  

“Something like that. What brings you to a bar like this? You don’t seem to be part of this crowd.” I pointed out.   

She looked over the room, her eyes staying on certain younger guys for a few seconds. She wasn’t hiding her hunger very well. I hoped she hadn’t realized I knew of supernatural creatures and assumed I was into local gruesome events like herself.   

“The guys here are easy. I smile at them, and I can take them home. Speaking of which, do you want to stay with me tonight?” She offered as she rested her chin in her hands.  

My mouth got dry again. I took a long sip of my drink hoping she would forget the offer in the next few seconds. She patiently waited for my answer. It was tempting. Very tempting. I almost said yes before I let my real brain think for a moment.   

“I’m not really your type. I’m honestly pretty depressing when you get to know me.” I half-joked hoping that scared her off.  

“I love pathetic men. The sadder the better.” She countered.  

“I’m working.” I said with a slight nervous shake in my voice.  

“I’m not asking for a quick hook-up in the bathroom. I can wait until the end of the night.”  

She reached out to take my hand. My body felt hot from the touch in an unnatural way. If I gave in, I risked getting my head torn off. My head was muddled by her perfume and the very little self-preservation I had left.   

“You’re very pretty.” I blurted out.  

I felt my face turn red. I meant to say she was out of my league and I was not going home with her.  

“I know.” She said cheerfully.  

I stared at her admiring her confidence. For some reason, we both started laughing. Once we calmed down, I was able to think through a few facts. The creature who had killed the four men went after older targets. Cameron wasn’t stressed out by my admission that I was working on the case. I doubted she was the monster going around ripping heads off. She wasn’t human, that much was clear. But I think she was a creature that drained something from their human victims but kept them alive. I didn’t see any pointed teeth when she smiled so I doubted she was a vampire. They were real, but full-blooded ones were very rare nowadays.   

“I can help with this job of yours. I like helping. If I'm useful a certain Corporation gives me nice perks” Cameron said and pulled back a little.  

So that’s why she approached me. She thought I was either an Agent or was connected with them. She knew a supernatural creature was lurking around aside from herself. But she also could have been lying or acting in a way that made me not suspect her of the murders. I had nothing besides my feelings to decide whether to trust her or not. A reason suggesting she wasn’t the monster I was after soon came when my phone pinged. I looked at the screen to see I had gotten a text. Ito sent me a single letter. H.   

My stomach dropped. I quickly stood up startling Cameron. I gathered my coat and made sure my tab had been paid for.   

“Where are you going?” Cameron asked sounding a little concerned.  

“Somewhere dangerous. I’ll see you later.”  

I might have a chance of taking her up on her offer someday. Right now, I needed to go help a baby-faced Agent. The bar he had been at was only been two blocks away. I started running the moment I was outside. My legs hurt from the effort. I hadn’t done much in my two years off and my older injuries didn’t help.  

My legs were screaming in pain by the time I nearly reached the other bar. I pushed the discomfort to the back of my mind when I spotted a figure stumbling out of an alleyway. I got to him just in time to catch the Agent before he collapsed on the street.  

“What happened?” I asked out of breath.  

I started looking around for any signs of a monster. Slowly Ito got back to his feet, and I let myself take a second to see how badly he had been hurt. I don’t know how I didn’t notice his left arm missing when I ran over. His suit jacket sleeve had been neatly cut off. I didn’t see any blood. A long deep cut ran along his cheek that also lacked any blood. It was as if someone had cut into porcelain The injury was clean with small cracks near the edges.  

“I’m sorry, I don’t know where it went.” He shamefully admitted.  

“It’s ok. Let's call for backup and get you out of here.”  

One of the best ways to stay alive while fighting monsters is to know when to leave. Ito wasn’t human and he had been hurt this badly. I wouldn’t stand a chance against whatever took his arm. I only had a knife and a handful of charms on me. I still couldn’t afford a gun with effective bullets. Ito bit his lip hating the fact I was right, and we needed to go.  

A sound came from the alleyway he just come out of. It was too dark to see what caused the noise. The Agent got in front of me just in time to block a sudden attack. A long hand made up of twisted flesh came from the darkness. It hit his shoulder hard making a cracking sound. I swiftly brought out my knife to slash at the deformed arm, drawing blood and causing it to dart back.   

“Run.” Ito pleaded.   

I refused to leave him behind. I grabbed a hold of his good arm ready to drag him when the monster came into view. It looked like a normal person. My blood ran cold with fear when I realized the face belonged to the man who was currently missing his head.  

I watched in horror as the flesh under the tattered shirt started to move. Within seconds the body transformed into a squirming moving pile of flesh. So many bodies constantly moved around into each other rotating between gruesome forms. Countless arms sprouted from its sides, each with jagged nails ready to kill us. I grabbed a piece of paper out of my pocket ready to attack. My body froze again when I heard another awful sound.   

A woman’s scream took my attention away from the monster long enough to see that Cameron had followed me. My heart sank knowing the creature now had all of its eyes focused on her. It wanted the best meal, and she clearly had more magic than us.  

I moved in time to slap a charm on one of the creature’s arms. I tried to get to Cameron but I was too late. A blast went off knocking me off my feet.   

Charms are paper with spells written on them. The spells could do almost anything if you put enough magic inside to power them. The most popular ones are charms that explode three seconds after it’s stuck to something. They’re basically magic hand grenades. The more powerful ones are more expensive. My basic charm knocked back the monster, but it also knocked back the rest of us.  

I lifted my head, my ears ringing from the blast. I was on my stomach, legs aching. I saw Cameron on her side too far away to reach. Her long hair covered her face. I smelled the magic in the air and thought I heard the monster screaming. My breath caught as my heart started to beat fast. It felt like my body was sinking into the ground, Into a terrible day that happened two years ago.   

I could no longer see the present. I only saw my old partner bleeding out on the ground. Her body was torn up from an attack I failed to protect her from. I knew this had already happened and yet I couldn’t get myself to move. I needed to snap out of it or else another person would die because of my inaction.   

It hurt. The thought of her hurt so much. At that moment, I was there. Half dead, legs missing, and too weak to change anything.  

I shut my eyes tight trying to get my breathing under control. No matter what I did, my thoughts always went back to the worst day of my life. Back to her.  

Suddenly I thought of the first time I met August. His pamphlets had WWJD printed on them. My old partner's name started with a J. I often would mentally say WWJD when in trouble. I hadn’t remembered that for two years.  

What would she do in this situation? Simple. She would get back up. I had gone into debt for these new legs. I needed to use them.  

My eyes shot open, the fear still sitting in my chest and yet I stood up. I took a mental note of the situation. I had a knife and one charm left. This creature was stunned but it would recover too fast for us to get away. Cameron was dazed by the blast. Whatever creature she was I doubted she could handle the monster in front of us. Ito was missing an arm and would die if he fought. So far it seemed as if we would all die no matter what. Backup would not arrive in time.  

I gripped the knife as I turned my attention back to the creature. It started to stand back up ready to kill us. It had an ever-changing number of hands sprouting from its back. A plate of what looked like bone covered the chest with the flesh forever moving underneath. Faces appeared along the exposed skin for a few seconds then disappeared back into the twisting shapes. It had a head made up of two fused faces. The mouth reaching from ear to ear filled with teeth.   

I decided to take a risk.  

I took the other charm and ran forward. The hands started toward Cameron but stopped when I got in front of the monster. Those arms turned in my direction. I didn’t give them time to grab hold. It opened its mouth again to let out an ear-piercing scream. With the charm in my left arm, I shoved it deep into the monster's mouth. The teeth came down on reflex, tearing up my forearm. Then the jaw opened again to spit my hand back out. I had seconds to act.  

I requested some small edits to my second charm. The first request was to make it taste as awful as possible so it would spit out my hand when I shoved the charm in the mouth of the creature. The second was to make it almost impossible to remove after it was stuck on. The taste was so bad the creature put its hands into its mouth trying to remove the piece of paper. It flailed, screaming. It backed up into the alleyway giving me long enough to reach Ito and Cameron.   

Cameron had stood up and started to move. I took hold of them and forced us against the wall of the nearest building. I used my body as a shield as I pressed them close together. The explosion of magic was larger than the first charm. Blood and pieces of flesh rained down from the alleyway. The monster had tried to get away and luckily enough, the buildings took most of the damage from the blast. To my shock, we lived.  

I carefully lifted my head to see if the coast was clear. Two very pretty faces looked up at me. I hadn’t noticed I wrapped an arm around their waists. We were crushed in a tight hug I quickly backed away from when I realized what I had done. I started to sputter out an excuse. Cameron cut me off by wrapping her arms tightly around my neck. I felt my face getting red hot. And it got hotter when more Agents arrived a minute after the explosion.   

Thankfully she quickly went over to explain to them what happened. But not before she forced her number on me.  

Ito stayed near me. He looked worried over my bleeding arm, but I assured him it was fine.   

“Are you really going to call her?” He asked, his eyes directed to Cameron and the two Agents carefully listening to her.  

“She’s cute. Maybe.” I answered with a shrug.  

For some reason, Ito looked even more concerned. He took my good hand with his.  

“Do you have a death wish?! Is this why you have this job? Whatever what the problem is we can talk about it.” He offered.  

I didn’t understand why he assumed such a thing.  

“What are you talking about?” I asked but didn’t take my hand back.  

I don’t think he could blush. If he could his cheeks would have been as red as mine were a few seconds ago.  

“Well... She’s a succubus. A full-blooded one it seems. If you slept with her... Uh. You’ll die.” He explained.  

I did a double-take. Her being a succubus made sense. I’ve heard a little about them. There was a decent number of half-blooded ones due to the fact of how often those types of creatures sleep around. Full-blooded ones were on the rarer side. If you went all the way with them, that was it. Almost every person who went that far became obsessed with them. They wouldn’t eat or sleep. They did nothing but think of another chance to share a bed with those monsters. Succubus drained humans when they did the deed. It depended on the person, but most were fully drained after three meetings. Even knowing all of that, my brain still very much wanted to call Cameron later.  

“You’re still thinking about it.” Ito said almost sounding disappointed.  

“Sorry.” I admitted.  

He got in front of me trying to block the view of Cameron.   

“Call me instead.” He offered.  

I took in his completely serious expression. I didn’t think I had done anything that impressed him enough to make such a suggestion. I glanced at his missing arm. He was a weak Agent. One that wouldn’t last very long at this job. He should have never even tried to fight the monster tonight. And yet, he was an honest person who cared about others. He instantly decided to offer himself up to save my life from Cameron.  

He was... Incredibly cute.  

“I’ll think about it.” I said smiling.  

“You better.” He threatened with a nod.  

“Are you going to be ok without an arm?” I pointed out.  

I hoped he wasn’t in too much pain because of his injuries.   

“I can easily replace it.” He half shrugged.  

That was a relief. We were called over to give reports about what happened. It soon became clear that the monster that I exploded was what ate the four men. It could shift between forms so after it ate its victims in the washrooms, it just walked out of the bar with a different face. It was interrupted before it could finish the last meal that night. Ito found it in a bathroom. He saved a person but lost an arm.  

I was told to get my cuts looked at by a clinic. I refused. I could treat them at home. Cheaper that way. We were let go for the night. Cameron clung to an Agent, but she waved at me. I waved back unable to help it. Supernatural creatures were able to handle succubus’ better than humans. I don’t think an Agent would die or become obsessed with her. She found a meal for the time being. I bet she followed me from the bar hoping for this outcome.  

I asked Ito to contact me to tell me how he was doing. I wanted to know he was alright and wasn’t just looking for him for a quick hook-up.  

I then went back to the bar to fulfill my promise to buy the homeless men dinner. They didn’t question my bloody arm which was nice.  

I got home tired as hell. I wrapped up my arm and crawled into bed.   

I wasn’t able to sleep. My brain kept going back to the events that made me retire from Contract Work. The death of my partner weighed heavy on my chest. I’d avoided thinking about it for so long. When I finally did, it felt like my body was made of lead.   

My phone went off in the dark from a text coming in. I reached over wondering who it might be.   

‘I heard there was an explosion downtown. Are you still alive?’  

I stared at the screen for a long time. Did August really care if I was dead or not? It was an odd feeling to have someone check up on me. Another text came through before I answered him.  

‘I was going to buy Lucas a goldfish to teach him about death, but you’ll do.’  

I frowned. I don’t know why I thought for a second he cared about me. He only cared about his adopted son. Which wasn’t entirely a bad thing.   

‘Go buy a fish.’ I replied.   ",143,0.95,13,02321,2024-11-06 16:04:08,1glai6j,156,High
NoSleep,Spring Cleaning,"I picked up a couple of odd jobs back in high school for some extra cash. I’d mow lawns, babysit—hell, I even helped some kid run a lemonade stand over the summer. He paid me 50 cents.

There was a house down the road whose owners were going to be out of town for the weekend. They were a husband and wife, but I couldn’t tell you what they looked like. Their names slip my mind; I didn’t even know they lived there. What I do remember is that they needed someone to clean up a few rooms in the house, so I took on the job. They were going to pay me a hefty amount, too—I think around $200, which was a hell of a lot of money at the time. I called a buddy of mine to help out and told him we could split the pay in half. The owners left that Friday morning, and my friend and I went over a few hours later.

The first thing I can recall in vivid detail was the *smell*. God, it was fucking rancid. The whole house smelled like it was covered in shit, garbage, and rotting food. And the weirdest part about it was that the place looked spotless when we walked in. Hell, I could’ve sworn the kitchen floor was sparkling. Everything was so organized that it actually made me uncomfortable; it kind of looked like an IKEA catalog.

“What the fuck is that smell?” John, the friend I brought, asked as soon as we stepped foot into the entryway. He looked like he was about to throw up, and he gagged.

I covered my nose with my hand. It didn’t do much; the smell was stuck in my nose, almost like a worm that squirmed its way up there and got itself stuck in my nostrils. I felt my eyes watering at the intensity of the stench.

We looked around for some air freshener. There was a can of Febreze under the sink, and John wasted no time in spraying it everywhere. He doused his clothes in it before handing the can to me, and I did the same. For a few seconds, all we could smell was the wonderful scent of Berry & Bramble.

But this didn’t last long. The odor penetrated the air again a few moments later, and at that point it just smelled like rotten strawberries and dog piss.

“God*damn*,” John coughed out. “What the fuck died in here?”

We cleaned the living room first. I mean, there really wasn’t all that much to clean considering how unnervingly neat everything was, but we vacuumed and dusted anyway. John mopped the parts that weren’t covered by the carpet, and I cleaned some of the glass cabinets with Windex. There was a large flatscreen TV on the wall, and some of the cables were hanging down. I considered plugging them back in, but I wasn’t sure how to do that. I ended up just leaving them alone.

The kitchen was next. Also spotless. I cleaned the already-pristine floor as John rushed to take out the trash, clearly ready to rid the air of the toxic waste we were breathing in. As I began to mop, John pulled open one of the bottom cabinets–you know, the one that rich people have to hide their garbage cans. I heard it open and expected to hear the rustling of the trash bag, but I didn’t. It was quiet for a moment before John spoke up.

“Dude,” he said. “There’s nothing in here.”

I looked up at him, stalling the mop in my hand. He was already looking at me.

“What do you mean ‘there’s nothing in there’?”

“I mean there’s no trash in here, dumbass,” he retorted. “It looks like they literally just changed the bag. You think the smell’s coming from a dumpster outside?”

I thought for a second, then looked at him blankly.

“We live in suburban America, man. There are no dumpsters outside.”

He gave me a look and rolled his eyes, mumbling a “whatever” under his breath. He grabbed the can of Febreze off the counter and sprayed it again, but there wasn’t much that came out. He shook it, obviously frustrated. We must’ve run out.

John groaned as we moved to the next room. Neither of us knew how much longer we were going to be able to stand the smell; you’d think we would’ve gotten used to it, but it was beginning to stink like rusted metal and three-week-old steak. It got stronger as we entered the dining room. I tried to make quick work of wiping it down with Clorox wipes. I had the collar of my shirt pulled up over my nose, inhaling the leftover Febreze fumes. John had walked by the stairs at some point in search of another canister, and then it really sounded like he was going to barf.

“Brad,” he called. “I think it’s coming from upstairs.”

I stopped cleaning. We looked at each other for a good minute, contemplating whether or not to check it out.

I sighed. It was probably just some trash they’d forgotten to take out—although with how clean and tidy the whole house was, I was really starting to doubt it. Either way, we were getting paid for this, so the least we could do is take care of whatever the hell was making the place smell like shit.

The stench grew stronger as we made our way up the stairs. John looked like he was about to pass out. I nearly did. I walked down the left side of the hall while John walked down the right, splitting up so we could get out of there as soon as possible. Each room I checked looked so unbelievably spotless that it actually ran a chill up my spine. Figures. I really just wanted to leave at that point; we could just call an exterminator or something like that to take care of it.

John was stomping around. It was obvious he was just running from room to room to say that he checked so we could leave. I couldn’t blame him; if I had to inhale any more of the pungent air, I was really going to die in that house.

His footsteps stopped, stalling for what seemed like a good five minutes. It was eerily silent, the kind where you just know that something’s not right. I left the upstairs bathroom to go find him and ended up in the master bedroom. The smell had almost tripled in intensity, and it hit me in the face so hard that I was knocked backward.

John was standing a little ways away from the side of the bed. He was completely still, frozen in place. If I squinted I might’ve been able to see him trembling a little. His face had paled, completely blanched. It looked like his blood had literally run cold. I can’t say he seemed like he’d just seen a ghost–no, it looked like he’d seen someone get shot in front of him. I cautiously made my way over to him, doing my best to ignore how my eyes watered from how strong the smell was getting.

“Dude,” I said. “What happened?”

He pointed to the bottom of the bed. The quilt was long and touched the floor, so I couldn’t see what he was looking at.

“Look under the bed.”

I furrowed my eyebrows at him, then took a deep breath of the disgusting air before crouching down and lifting the bottom of the blanket up.

I couldn’t see what it was at first, but I knew for a fact that this is where that god-awful smell was coming from. I don’t know how it had gotten worse, but it did. It was rotten and putrid—like something was decomposing. It had gotten so strong that I nearly passed out, but I held my breath and squinted my eyes to see what was under there.

It was something small and oblong. Its silhouette wasn’t exactly smooth; there were a few bumps along what I assumed was the top of it and deep indents in other parts. It was difficult to see in the dark, so I lifted the quilt a little more to get some light in from the rest of the room.

The slight increase in brightness gave way for me to make out a little more of it. The thing itself was a weird mix of pink and gray and gross, but it was kind of hard to tell because it was covered in something dark and wet that dampened the carpet below it. I leaned in a little closer to get a better look, and I could now make out relatively even shapes on the left side. Well, maybe “even” isn’t the right word. Some parts were sunken in to the point where I really couldn’t make out what they were supposed to look like. But I did see that the thing had hair. It was sticking to it with the weird dark stuff, and the sight of it made me queasy; the combination of rot and slop just made me want to vomit.

The hair was at the top of it, but there were also some tiny strands in one spot that I could see solely because they were all clumped together. It looked like there should’ve been another on the other side of its surface. There was a bump in the middle of it that looked crushed in. A little further down, there was a stubby appendage–two of them, I think, but I couldn’t really tell. There were two longer ones near the bottom of it. I know that one was shorter than the other, almost like it was cut in half. In the center of the thing was a jagged opening that was covered in that dark wet stuff, and there was something coming out of it. It kind of looked like a bunch of sausage links that had spilled onto the floor.

And then I realized what I was looking at.

I did vomit then. I vomited so hard that I thought my throat was going to tumble out of my mouth and land on the carpet next to that thing. I wanted to cry; maybe I did. I don’t know–I can’t really remember much of what happened after that. I’m pretty sure we ran out of the house. One of us called the police–I’m thinking it was John. I don’t even know if he told them what we saw. I don’t know if he could.

I’ve tried to forget it. Really, I have. I went to therapy for a good while after the fact, but it was so hard to talk about it that I ended up just dropping the whole thing. I know that therapy’s supposed to help with that–talking about it, I mean. But any time I thought about it I’d feel like I was going to throw up. Sometimes I did. Even vomit smelled better than what was in that house.

Something like that just sits with you forever. And maybe it’s the guilt that’s making me write this–guilt from what, I don’t know. John and I stopped talking after that, so I can’t go and ask him about any of this. It’d be a real shit thing for me to do, anyway. Some things just have to stay dead.

I’m thirty now. I live a state over and have a pretty good job, so no more weird tasks for me. Things are steady-going, and I’ve started to appreciate the mundane. I like to think I’ve been doing a little better in life.

But every now and again I’ll get a whiff of that rancid smell, even though this had happened over fifteen years ago and I should’ve forgotten it. As I write this, its vile stench is starting to fester in my nose.

And I swear it’s coming from under my [bed.](https://www.reddit.com/user/pk-faulkner/)",24,0.84,5,pk-faulkner,2024-11-06 20:55:19,1glgnc3,29,High
NoSleep,why you shouldn't ever enter The Silent Elk,"I never thought I’d be writing something like this, but after everything I’ve experienced, I feel like I need to warn others. It started as just another job, a simple gig in a remote forest to help me get away from the chaos of city life. Little did I know that the forest held something far worse than isolation.

I’m William, and I was hired to maintain a radio tower in the Dark Elk Forest. It’s about three miles off the nearest town, and most people avoid it, mostly due to how dense and dark the trees are. People say it’s peaceful, but they also talk about strange things that happen. I didn’t believe any of that at the time.

The cabin I stayed in was small, just a place to sleep and eat, and the radio tower was old—needed a lot of work. For the first few nights, it was all business. I spent my days fixing equipment, walking through the forest to check the tower, and recording some sounds of the wildlife. It wasn’t much, but the quiet was nice. Too quiet, I would later realize.

On the third night, I started hearing something I couldn’t explain. At first, I thought it was just the wind or maybe a big tree falling, but the noise was different. It was like... the sound of the trees themselves breaking, slowly, as if they were crumbling to dust. It started faint, but by midnight, the sounds were loud enough to make the entire cabin shake. I grabbed my recorder and went outside, hoping to capture whatever it was.

“Maybe it’s just an old tree collapsing,” I said to myself, trying to stay calm.

But when I listened to the playback, I realized that wasn’t it. The noise wasn’t like anything I’d ever heard. It sounded like the forest itself was moving, shifting. I tried to convince myself it was just my mind playing tricks, but the next night it happened again. The crumbling sound—closer this time. And the worst part? The forest went dead silent. No birds, no wind, no rustling leaves. It was like the entire forest was holding its breath.

That’s when I saw it.

I was sitting outside, near the fire I’d started to keep the cold away. The sky was clear, and the stars looked incredible out there, away from the lights of the town. But as I stared into the woods, I saw something that I’ll never forget. It was tall, almost unnaturally tall, and pale—so pale it almost glowed in the dark. Its eyes were black, like two empty voids, and its fingers were long, like tree branches. And its rib cage was exposed, hanging like some kind of grotesque sculpture.

It didn’t move. It just stood there, watching me.

I tried to call out, but my voice felt strangled, like I couldn’t force the words past my throat. “Who... who are you?” I managed to whisper. But the thing didn’t respond. It just stood there, silently watching me.

I ran back into the cabin, locked the door, and grabbed my radio equipment. I tried to record my voice. “This is William, night three. I think... I think there’s something in the woods. Something I can’t explain. It’s—” But before I could finish, I heard it again. The crumbling noise, closer than ever.

I kept my lights on all night, sitting in the corner of the cabin, praying I was imagining things. But every time I closed my eyes, I could hear it—the sound of the trees, like they were bending under some heavy weight, and then a slow breath... a breath that didn’t belong in nature.

The next night, I heard a voice over the radio. It was faint at first, like static, but then it cleared.

“William… leave. Leave before you’re marked,” the voice said, barely above a whisper.

I was stunned. I grabbed the radio, desperate for answers. “Who is this? What do you mean? What’s happening in this forest?”

But the voice never answered again. It was just static.

I didn’t know what to do, but I couldn’t stay there. Something in my gut told me I needed to leave—before it was too late. But the road back was long, and the forest felt... wrong. As I packed my things, the air turned cold, and the sounds of the forest changed. The wind stopped. The birds went silent. I could feel it closing in on me.

I tried to drive away, but I swear, the trees seemed to move, like they were shifting, blocking my path. The crumbling noise was all around me, and I could hear faint whispers, like something was trying to talk to me through the static of the radio.

I didn’t stay. I don’t know what happened after I left, but I haven’t been back since. I’m not the same anymore, and I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to shake the feeling that something was watching me. Something… I shouldn’t have disturbed.

All I know is that the forest isn’t as empty as it seems. And if you ever find yourself near Dark Elk Forest, don’t stay after dark. If you hear the trees crumbling… it’s already too late.

I know this sounds crazy, but I’ve heard stories of others who’ve gone in there and never come out. I thought I was just hearing things, but now I’m not so sure. The people in the town don’t talk about it much. They know better.

Just… please, be careful.",20,0.88,3,Local-Form8831,2024-11-06 20:50:59,1glgke7,23,High
NoSleep,Something is horribly wrong with the spider in this house.,"My name is Boswaldo. I am the esteemed butler of this Manor, and I take my duties very seriously. I run quite the tight ship indeed. Every nook of every cranny is meticulously inspected, and subsequently polished to utter perfection, by myself. Everything. Silverware, swords, antiques, armours, and any other such masterfully procured accoutrements, those are my domain. 

That is, except for spider webs... 
I cannot -nay, I will not- under any circumstances, permit myself to interfere with any surface on which they reside. I simply won’t. There is a ghastly spider which resides within these walls, and I fear for my safety should I ever dust, disturb, or otherwise deface its home. Luckily for myself, my master went blind a good many years ago, and so he is left completely unaware of the webs that curse his home.  
Now normally, in the morning, I bring a wholesome breakfast of pastries, coffee, and cigarettes to my master, but today, at his chamber door, loomed the aforementioned spider. I froze where I stood. Terrified of what it might do to me, what it was planning. It was just a tiny little thing, no bigger than a button. But in that moment, it had total dominion over me. I was sure I felt my heart grow still.  
And that is when my master called out to me. 
“Boswaldo? Is that you?” He asked.  
I tried to reply but felt as though I might choke on my own breath. 
“Boswaldo!”  
“y-yes sir it- it- it's me!” I stammered back, all the while staring at this dark thing in the doorway.  
“I’m waiting...” he said, rather impatiently. He was of course waiting for his breakfast; however, I saw no path before me to make it through his door unscathed and was myself waiting to suddenly drop dead. 
“Sp- sp-p-p spider! There- theres a sp- a spider sir!” 
“Well then just squish the bloody thing!” 
As always, my duties as a butler meant I must obey my master. I felt my heart beating once more. I caught my breath. And with a newfound sense of courage, promptly crushed the spider beneath my boot.  

Relief washed over me and all the ills I had felt seemed to melt away. I lay my master’s breakfast on his bedside and began the rest of my day. That night I slept wonderfully, I had finally freed this house, and myself, from this gruesome spider’s grasp.  

Now, you can imagine my terror when the following morning, once again at my master’s door, it stood. Yet this time, the spider was twice its previous size. I scoffed. Suspecting my mind to be playing tricks on me. This time I killed the spider before my own anxiety even had a chance to paralyse me. 

This went on for some time. Every morning, the spider sat there. And every morning, my shoe came down upon it. As the days had passed, so too did my fear. But yesterday, when looking upon a truly monstrous arachnid did I process just how large it had become. It was now as big and hairy as a house cat! This confirmed that it truly had been getting larger and I had not, in fact, simply been misremembering its size each morning.  
Cautiously, I raised my leg... Tensions were high and to be quite honest, I had to look away. There was a moment of stillness. And then, like lightning, my foot came crashing down. 

But the spider was not slain! It recoiled and hurried into my master’s chamber. I gave chase. Once inside, I caught up to it and jumped upon its head. That had done the trick. As I stood there, soaked in sweat, staring down at the beast, a voice pierced the silence. My master. 
“Boswaldo? Is that you?” 
I wiped the sweat from my brow, fixed my jacket and took a deep breath. 
“Yes master. Your breakfast sir.” I retrieved his morning comestibles and quickly saw myself out. 

I marched through the halls with vigour, for I had preparations to make. Based on what just occurred, I knew what the morrow would bring. And I, had to be ready. I fetched a rapier from the dining room and donned a suit of armour.  
That night, I dared not to slumber. I sat in my chamber and clutched tightly to the sword. My eyes were pinned to the door. Sometime later, the moon still about the sky, I began to hear a tapping. Sharp, terrible tappings against the wall. I knew it to be the spider, bigger than before. I could hear it, clambering around, as if adjusting to its new hideous size. As the night drew on, it became more nimble. More precise.  

As I sat there entranced, almost hypnotised by its lumbering, I heard something that chilled me to the bone. 
“Boswaldo? Is that you?”  
It was then that I realised he was no longer alone in his room. Shaking I rose from my chair and stepped out from within my chamber.  
In the hallway, as I crept forward, I felt every fibre of my being urge me not to take another step. But I did. And every step was a battle. And every sound I made, every breath, every clinking of my armour, felt as loud as thunder.  
Finally, after what seemed like a lifetime, I reached his door. And for once, there was no spider.  

As I went for the handle, I again felt as though I couldn’t go on. But I did. I opened the door. And I saw it on the bed. Feasting upon my master. As the beast turned toward me, I was completely at its mercy. Captivated by its inky eyes. There was no malice behind them. No seeming of hatred for me, the man who had killed it so many times before. It was just looking. And finally, I realised, our feud was not our feud. It was my feud. Against a creature which had done nothing more than stand in a doorway. Its greatest crime was that I had been afraid of it. I tried to tell myself that this spider had killed my master, but I knew deep down, I was the reason he was dead.  

Carefully I backed away, and slowly closed the door.  

I will not leave this manor. But I will not cause any more death. I know that before long, it will come for me, and I will join my 
master. 

If you find this post, pray, stay far, far away from here. And do not come looking for the spider.

NoSleep,My child hasn't been sleeping..,"Hello,

Let me start by saying I don't believe in curses and I am not religious. My name is Doug, and my wife and I have struggled with our son. He has sleep problems that just came from nowhere. It all started one night, it was only a week or so ago, on the night of the first rainfall, we live in a pretty small eastern coastal town of Briggem, so when it rains it can get pretty bad. I was at my home watching reruns of Miami Vice, while my wife was getting dinner ready. We live in my childhood home, a single story. I had our youngest daughter in her walker. When the rain started to hit the window. 

That was when Charlotte and I realized we didn't know where Finn, our 10-year-old was. We called all over from his friends' parents to the school. No one knew. My wife started to blame me, while I was getting my coat on to go - at this point, I was a few beers down the chute when I opened the door ignoring my wife's rant - and there he was. He stood there on the front step, drenched. I don't know how long he was there or what I just took my son in and hugged him. I carried him inside and put a towel around him, trying to warm him up. My wife started to draw a bath, through her cloudy eyes. I asked him where he was and why no one knew where he went.

He just said, ""I wanted to go to the woods."" I didn't find anything wrong with this, I used to go to the same woods all the time when I was a kid with my brother and with friends.

""Near the creek?""

He nodded.

""Did you see anything?""

My boy just looked up at me his blue lips barely hanging onto his face and shook his head.

""Something red.""

I didn't know what the hell that meant so I helped walk him over to the bathroom where my wife was and she started to take care of him. I just walked back towards the family room, aghast at what I allowed to happen. I didn't know what to do so I just thanked whoever was listening in my head.

My wife and I knew that he was probably going to get a cold or something worse from this, so we kept an ear open and barely slept ourselves that night. His coughs kept us up as we took shifts while sitting nearby. Some were empty like a wheeze scratching the walls of his throat while they escaped, others were full of gunk and sludge, followed by him rolling over and spitting the excess in the nearby trashcan. It was around 5 am when I tapped my wife out, letting her go to sleep for an hour or so. I sat there after brewing some coffee and listened to Finn go through hell. In Times like this it's good to have a wife who's as caring as Charlotte, when I have to go to work, I know that she will be here with my kids. I was slightly nodding off around 5:30 before I awoke. Something was off, I didn't know why yet but I could feel it. 

That was when it hit me. I was dozing off because the house was silent. I jumped up from my seat and ran into my son's room. The door slammed against the wall as I dove at my son fearing the worst. Swearing at myself for not taking him to the emergency room. But, as I got to him I realized his chest moving up and down. He was fine. He was better than fine, he looked as peaceful as ever sleeping. Lying on his side, his left hand under his head. Even my landing on him barely made him budge. I scratched my head looking around. When I looked in his garbage off the edge of the bed, where I imagined seeing a mound of phlegm and mucus but nothing was in there. Nothing at all. Thinking I lost my mind I just shook my head and walked out of his room. Over a day or so Finn was all back to normal health and at school.

A few nights later, it happened. I got up out of bed around 1 am, I was the one having trouble that night. I walked into our kitchen and opened the fridge, reaching into the case and opening the tab on the side so it wouldn't crack too loud and wake my wife. I took a long sip of it, following it with a loud breath. The cool lager put my mind at ease as I turned from the fridge - he stood there. Half covered by the door frame he watched me. I put the can behind my back, failing to hide what he clearly already saw.

""What's up, buddy?""

""Why do you drink so late Dad?""

I just shrugged bringing the tone down in the conversation to again not wake my wife. I put my finger up to my mouth to shush him a little. I opened my mouth to try to answer -

""Do you drink because of Kevin?""

My answer got caught in my throat before it could exit. He blinked at me - twice. Then he turned around and went into his room. Leaving me speechless. I could only clench my teeth together, hidden behind my cheeks. I drank the last bit of my beer and couldn't help but open another.

I barely told Finn about Kevin. I barely told Charlotte. I kept it in my head, and just with my parents. I still never understood. Kevin was my little brother. I don't know if I wanted to get into it. But, over the last few nights, I need to talk about it. See Finn has gotten worse, not coughing or anything he hasn't been right. He just hasn't slept, at all. It was bad, Charlotte found him one night, she checked on him just slipping her head through the cracked door. He was in bed, but sitting straight up. Staring at the wall, he didn't even turn to her when she called him. He was in a trance, mouth open, his breathing in deep and out shallow. She ran over to him, rubbing his back his breathing got better but his eyes stayed on the wall. When she came to our room and told me, I had nothing to say, I chalked it up to maybe a horror show or movie he caught when we weren't paying attention. I told her that I was going to check on him as she got into bed, I left my room but on my way to his something overtook me. I couldn't have him ask more about Kevin, at least not yet. 

I turned into my kitchen and grabbed my bottle of vodka from above the fridge and walked out into my garage. I only took a few pulls, but it was hard to keep down, I got so used to just beer. I walked into my home after getting a good bit of the bottle down. I put it back grabbed the OJ carton out of the fridge, and took a few sips out of it. That's when I heard the giggling coming from the crack of Finn's room. It was light and soft, but it creeped the hell out of me. I decided to try to look in the room myself, the dark room was only lit by the window above his bed. But, he wasn't in it. The sheets and covers were thrown to the side. Then I heard the giggles, there were two of them. My head whipped over towards my right where Finn stood by his wall. I turned to the lights on in fear, as Finn slowly turned to me. I looked in the room for a second.

""Go to bed, Finn.""

He nodded and slowly walked back to his bed. I shut off the light after taking one more look in the room. I couldn't sleep that night. Not a minute. Because, before I turned his lights on, I could have sworn I saw a hand reaching and touching my son's face.

The next morning I was out and about I forgot what for, but on my way home I saw the flashing lights. I saw the ambulance rush past me out of my neighborhood. I feared the worst and sped home. I found my wife on the porch, crying on the phone. I jumped out of the car and held her asking her what happened.

She told me this verbatim: She was doing laundry, and our daughter was in the living room bouncing. She went to bring folded laundry into Finn's room, hoping that he was napping and catching some sleep. She didn't even knock; she just barely opened it - she saw him in there. She saw our boy standing in the center of his room, arched backward, his head almost touching his calves. She couldn't breathe, as Finn's right arm started to rise in the air, that's when she noticed that he wasn't standing. His feet were inches off the ground. When she screamed that was when he fell.

I just took my wife into my arms. Holding her there, confused as all hell. Hoping this one moment could last forever before we would have to find out what was wrong with our boy, by her words he had to be paralyzed with a broken back. I then ushered her into the car, running back inside and grabbing our baby girl. Before we were off to the hospital.

So, now it's time to talk about my brother Kevin. I think it's time that I bring up Kevin. Kevin was my younger brother, he was only 8 years old when he got sick. At first, it came off as the flu, he was bedridden and only missed a few days of school. I remember it like it was yesterday because frankly, it was all so odd. Kevin got home late the day before his sickness. He was always a sprite and fun kid, always looking for an adventure even at a young age. I always took him places too, because he could keep up with 13-year-old me on any bike ride. He had this gummy smile and an infatuation with Superman. 

We weren't rich or anything growing up, so my mom had bought him a cheap cape from a hand-me-down store. For the next year, he always wore that cape, while he was biking down to his friend Anthony's house, I remember it always flailing in the wind as if he were flying in the air.

After he got sick, I don't remember him putting it on ever again. He came home that day. From what I remember my mother telling me, rest her soul, that he walked into the house for the first time in complete silence. He got ready for bed without eating anything, and that was it. In that bed, he stayed for days. I would always knock to see if he wanted to do anything and he would refuse. During those days, I started to feel off. I woke up one night in complete sweat, confused and not remembering my dream that I had I left my bed and went into my kitchen. I poured a cup of water and chugged it as it was so cold it burned my throat. I took a second and then went to go back to bed. 

When I heard something soft coming from inside Kevin's room, behind the closed door. I stopped and put my ear to it. It sounded like he was talking to himself. It sounded like he was maybe giggling. Then it sounded like two voices talking at the same time. They overlapped each other, but no distinct words were actually being stated. I held my ear there longer maybe to get a nugget of information. Then the voices stopped. A coldness drafted up my spine, a bead of sweat down my nose.

""Dougie."" The voices said.

I backed away fast and ran into my room. Clawing into my bed, and sitting there. I didn't sleep the rest of the night. It took only twenty or so minutes when I started to hear creaks from outside my room. I stared at the door, terrified of my own little brother. Scared of how he knew it was me outside his room. But, when I saw the shadows cross underneath my door. I saw two sets of legs. Just standing there. No knocks on my door, no whispers, nothing. Those legs stood there, motionlessly for ten minutes. Before, they turned back to his room. I just stared and stared all night.

From there things took a turn for the worse. Kevin slid into a brain coma due to a lack of oxygen a few days later. He then died a week after that, fluid in his lungs built up to the point of suffocation but the doctors never detected it. It always seemed like he was breathing normally to everyone that checked. He was only eight years old. It was odd too, because after he got sick, I remember his buddy Anthony started to miss school as well.

I always hated myself for being afraid of him. His saying Dougie outside of his door could have been a call for help, it could have meant anything. But, young me mistook it for something frightening something that was meant to warn me to stay away from my only brother. That's why I bought my home, my old childhood home, as a reminder of my brother and what he meant to me. I still keep it deep down though, I rarely talk about it to my wife, and never to my son. Kevin almost completely died when my parents passed away. The only people that really might remember him are Anthony and I. We don't really speak, I say hi whenever I walk into him at the liquor store. He has been looking worse. But, he has been through so much. I can’t talk about his story.

When Charlotte and I got to the hospital, they were running tests on Finn. Finn never looked more alive. He was sitting up in his chair and smiling with the nurses. My wife through tears looked as confused as everyone else did once they saw her. She ran up and held our son in the brightest embrace, like the first time she ever held him. I stood there, my wife doesn't lie. My wife doesn't over-impose anything. How did she see what she saw? How is it that now I am being told that Finn is doing great and that we can take him back in only a few hours? I insisted that they watch him and take care of him for at least a night. But, they needed the bed in case of an emergency. I was at that point done with the conversation and didn't want to expedite it further, maybe upsetting my wife and son who have both been through a lot.

We got home that night and I carried my son into the house while my wife carried our daughter. We laid them both to bed. I told my wife to call the police if anything happened, but that I needed to go somewhere. We had a light argument. Before I told her that I had to go to the creek. That was the last place Finn was before he got sick. She didn't want to hear it but she knew that it wasn't the worst decision. Before I left, she stopped me. She asked me if I believed her and if I didn't think she was crazy for what she told me. I told her of course. That I was as confused as she was. I kissed her and then I left.

Driving up to the woods at night can be daunting. Darkness. It was even worse because it took everything that I had to not pull into any of the bright signs above the bars that I passed. Drink it away. Drink the thought of Kevin, the thought of my home, and the thought of anything all away. But, I pushed on. Now that I made my decision, I moved into the bush, through the trees, and into the dirt. Hindsight was 20/20 because I forgot a flashlight but I knew my way. Even though it has been 20 or so years since I last came down here, this place has been sunken deep into my soul. I made it to the low-tide creek and stood over it on the bank. It was filled with leaves, and couldn't have been any more than a few inches deep. This creek used to be big for fishing.

I barely heard anything other than the light water going against rocks, no squirrels, no owls, nothing but the creek. I looked around and realized that my hope was all but lost. What was I even expected to find here that I came all this way? Left my wife at home with our kids. I turned and walked the creek a bit. Looking up and down, the big bright moon cut its way through the tree limbs and guided my trail a little.

Then I swore I felt it, something grabbed my ankle as I turned and fell down into the water. The water didn't expect me and I smack against it. My head hit the edge of a rock and I stayed in the water for a second using it to cover my scream of agony. I then pulled myself up and looked around. I swore I felt something grab me, that I didn't just catch the lip of the bank. That I wasn't that clumsy. I swear it. I clung to the dirt as I crawled up the side of the bank, hoping that my head wasn't bleeding too badly. I got to the edge and looked over, it was then that I saw it.

I saw what Finn saw. It was red, but it was covered. I got out of the bank and ran up to it. I looked down, and my heart sank. It couldn't be it just wouldn't make sense. But, I knelt down moving everything that was on top of it all the leaves and broken branches, and picked it up in my hands. I knew the material and the way that it would move in the air. As if it were just yesterday.

I was holding back tears, as I looked down at Kevin's old cape.

A feeling overflowed me, and my head snapped as if I had been plugged into a computer. Everything came to me at once, every memory, every feeling, why I was so awkwardly terrified that night with Kevin. I ran through the trees back to the road, back to my car, and hopefully back to safety. I just hoped through the pain of my grip on my brother's scarlet cape. I drove home in silence. The lights of the bars hadn't lost their appeal, they shined even brighter. But, I pushed ahead. I needed to get back to Charlotte. To my wife, to my son, and to my daughter.

I pulled onto the driveway. I walked up opening the door. Charlotte jumped at the door when I walked in. She was wide awake on the couch. I looked at her, with every word on the tip of my tongue ready to spill. But, just one glance at her was enough. I think she saw something was wrong, I hope she did. Because I stood there and I wept. I fell to my knees, as I couldn't hold back anymore. She stood up and this time, she held me while I didn't have the strength myself.

When I touched that cape, it took over and I couldn't let go as much as I wanted to. All of the memories that I pushed out that I didn't care for, flooded back into my mind. They clenched on with knives and bit with teeth as they seeped back into my brain.

I then told Charlotte, about my last day with Kevin before he slipped into his coma. I was in the living room watching television when I heard him coughing from his room. I went to go check on him, and there I saw him sitting straight up in his bed like he was waiting for me. I went and sat at his side.

""How are you feeling Kevin?""

""Good. How are you?""

I nodded at him.

""Dougie, I never got to tell you something.""

""What's that?""

""Well, it's just that I am worried for you.""

""Why are you worried?""

Something in the corner of my eye caught my attention, and I looked down at his trash.

Inside the bin laid a large mound of black gunk, which must have been a week's storage.

""Because you're son is going to die just like I will.""

I looked at him.

It wasn't my brother. His eyes were flooded with black sewage as it dripped and creased through his face, his teeth were rotted to the gums, the gums grey to the gills. I jumped as he looked up at the ceiling and his mouth opened - then like a fountain blackness canvased out of his mouth and to the ceiling. I looked at it for a moment and fell to the ground. Knocking me out.

I awoke on the couch. It took every bit of strength of mine to go back to the room to find any evidence of the accident happening, but I walked inside of the room and it looked just as clean as when I entered prior. I waited for my parents to get home and when they did I told them about it.

""Don't rile your brother up with these hysterics!""

""Your mother has been going through so much with all of this, why bring up this? You need to stop watching those horror movies with your friends!""

That is all I got.

I stayed silent, I thought it was all in my head. I remember it so clearly now.

Because, after touching that cape it all became so clear. Everything aligned correctly. That night, when I heard Kevin whispering in his room, and when he stood outside my door, that was three days after he slipped into a coma.

If anyone lives or has lived in Briggem if anyone knows anything about the creek in the woods. If anyone has any idea what the hell might be happening to my son. Please, and by all means reach out. My family is so lost. I am terrified for my son Finn. Because he collapsed today, we had to bring him into the hospital, and about an hour ago, the doctors told me that he was building a large amount of fluid in his lungs, more than the normal case of pneumonia. I am afraid what happened to my brother might happen to him.

If anyone can, please help us.

NoSleep,The Prophet’s Eye - Part 1,"I was about twelve years old when I first took notice of my ‘condition’. I had lived in the middle of Philadelphia all my life up until that point, and I had no reason to consider the night sky nor could I if I wanted to for the ever-present light pollution bombarding my light receptors. That is, until I met my lifelong friend, Jared. About three weeks after my twelfth birthday in March of 2009, my father got a job with the National Forestry Service, which transferred my family across the country to a very small town just south of Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming.

 The move wasn’t nearly as hard on me as some might expect from a kid of that age. Honestly, I hated Philadelphia. Where we lived, I seemingly could never get a wink of sleep due to the constant traffic, which made school days miserable for me. In fact, I was probably the happiest I had ever been the week my mom and dad announced the move.  

By the beginning of Summer break, we had officially moved into our small, ranch-style house among the small community of about ten other houses called Shuever, Wyoming. That first day when we drove from the airport in Denver to the town, I had serious jet lag and slept most of the time. But when my mother finally eased me back to consciousness upon our arrival, my head spun at the vastness of the sight before me. I had never seen such an expanse of open land in my life, a land mute, deaf, and blind to the man-made jungle spread across the rest of the planet. It was perfect. More so than I could have known. 

   That same day Mrs. Wilkins, who lived next door, invited us over for lasagna, which made my stomach cramp after the ten straight hours of moving boxes, and we all gladly accepted and essentially left immediately. The Wilkins’ house was quite a bit like ours, and the rest of the community for that matter: a small rancher built from dark brown brick and gray-blue metal roofing. We were all greeted by her husband, who led us across the house, down the central hallway, and to the right where there stood a modest table prepared with a from-frozen lasagna, various sodas, and butter-garlic breadsticks. And already seated at the table was the Wilkins’ only child. The one who I would come to know as Jared. He was about two years younger than me and spent most of the time with his head down, trying to keep from drawing any attention to himself. 

Honestly, not much happened at that table. The Wilkins were all noticeably quiet for most of the time. Not awkwardly so, but they were just not quite as outgoing as many of my friends from Philadelphia. It was a nice change of pace. After about half an hour, Mrs. Wilkins finally spoke up, “Jared, why don’t you show Tyler to your room? Maybe you can show him your telescopes!” Jared grinned meekly and motioned for me to follow him back down the hallway where his room was. At the end of the hallway to the left was an off-white painted door with a faded bronze knob that was not unlike many of the doors from my old school which had not been renovated since the eighties.

With some force, Jared opened the door and I was bombarded with vibrant shades of blue and white. His walls were covered with posters and signage from long-accomplished missions from NASA. There were at least two Apollo posters, and several others for Mercury, Gemini, and the shuttle programs. Diagonally across the room from his bed was an admittedly impressive display of five telescopes, ranging from two to ten inches in diameter. After taking a pause to fully appreciate what I was seeing, Jared spoke up for the first time, “So…uh…yeah. These are my telescopes…” He trailed off, naming models and numbers that meant nothing to me. I had never cared to know about space, but hearing the crescendo of passion in his voice actually began to pique my interest. “So…I’m guessing you go stargazing out here a lot?” I asked. He responded, “Yeah, at least once or sometimes twice a week depending on the weather. I try to keep track of relatively close objects to see if I can determine their paths. I have schoolwork to do tonight, but you can go out with me and my dad tomorrow night to see for yourself!” “Uh…yeah! Sure!” I replied, this was probably going to be my only friend for a long while, so I wasn’t going to pass up his offer. “We can meet at my house tomorrow night at 8:00 if that’s okay with you.” 

   “I’ll ask mom, but I should be able to do that.” I responded, somewhat off put by his sudden preparedness. I spent the rest of the evening listening to Jared Wilkins ramble on about his now very apparent hyper fixation, squeezing in the occasional question or passing comment. By the time I had been in his room for two hours straight, I started to regret my decision of taking up his offer to go stargazing, but ultimately decided it was for the best. By 9:00 that evening, my mother called me back to the other side of the house to thank our hosts for the meal and make plans for the next night’s excursion, which my parents both wholeheartedly agreed to, seeing my need for a friend in this new and quite empty place. 


The next day was somewhat of a blur. More unpacking and organizing interspersed with quick breaks to eat. We all tried to keep our food consumption to a minimum, considering the nearest town with supplies was an hour-drive away, but my parents assured me that they would get more food once we were all unpacked. Before I knew it, it was time to go next door. I had expected that they would just take the telescopes to their backyard and watch from there, but instead, they had a Kawasaki Mule loaded down with all our viewing equipment, cameras, and sleeping bags. 

Jared explained that they were planning to go to a place called Reiner’s Point where there was no light pollution whatsoever and that they were planning on spending the night there to see planets that only appear in the early morning hours. I still agreed and we made the ten mile drive across the mostly empty land which was flat at first, but swiftly began to incline when we entered a sudden band of fragrant pine trees. From there, we drove for two more especially grueling miles heading nearly straight up over boulders and downed trees, which ended up taking longer than the previous eight miles, and by the time we reached the plateau above, the sun was almost fully sunken. 

   Reiner’s Point, it turned out, was a corner roughly situated on the southwestern edge of the plateau that was slightly higher than the surrounding land. It appeared slightly burnt and smelled of old charcoal where they had camped many times before. Of course, they weren’t planning on starting another fire tonight, though. We busied ourselves setting up the telescopes, and I mainly just helped out by holding parts for the other two who obviously knew what they were doing. All the while, Jared and his father were making comments about objects that were becoming visible as the sky darkened and how they had moved positions throughout the year. Jared then tugged at my shirt and pointed roughly northeast, “You see? There’s Capella, about 40 degrees off from Polaris. Using that, we can find the Andromeda Galaxy through the telescope. Isn’t it awesome! Bet you never saw anything like this back in Pennsylvania.” I looked almost directly up to where he was pointing and squinted and shook my head and rapidly blinked. For some reason, I couldn’t see anything. 

I thought that maybe my eyes hadn’t adjusted yet, or that somehow my eyes had been ruined by my lifetime of near constant light pollution. “I…I don’t see it.” I said hesitantly, trying not to sound stupid. Jared continued to point vigorously, “It’s right there. The brightest star in this direction…don’t you see?” “I…don’t see anything up there…it’s just black.” I said, and immediately Mr. Wilkins stopped what he was doing, adjusting the telescopes to the correct focus, and seemed to contemplate something, then glanced over at Jared, who’s eyes had seemed to freeze over for a few seconds. There was an awkward pause for another 30 seconds or so before Mr. Wilkins finally spoke up. “Do…you wear glasses, son?” 

“No, I’ve never worn glasses in my life. I’ve always read fine and never had problems with seeing far away things.”  I said, concluding that I should probably ask my parents to go see an eye doctor, if there was one to be found within 100 miles, if I couldn’t even see the stars. I don’t know…maybe the sudden onset of symptoms could indicate something more serious? Maybe I injured myself at some point during the move? As if to respond to my very thoughts, Mr. Wilkins spoke up again somewhat coldly, “There’s an eye doctor over in Casper. You should see if your parents can take you there. His practice is on the end of Grant Street, should be easy enough to find from there.” 

I was admittedly confused by his imperative attitude when he said that. I could see just fine…at least, for the most part. It wasn’t that serious. I just continued squinting into the ink-blackness, desperately trying to make out anything. Eventually, I think I counted about two discernible points of light with maybe three others, although I was much less sure if they were actually there. I pointed to the two points I saw, “Actually…I think I can see two stars now, one right above us and one over to the north.” Jared explained, “Those two actually aren’t stars. That one right above us is Saturn…that one over there is Jupiter. That’s really all you can see?” I replied, my face turning more red, defying the cool fall air, “Yeah, there may be some others, but as soon as I try to focus on them, they disappear.” 

“It actually kind of makes sense…” Jared continued to explain, “It’s a new moon tonight, and Jupiter and Saturn should be the brightest points you can see out here. It’s like my dad said, you could really use some glasses.” Again, his voice trailed off into a strange intonation when he mentioned ‘glasses’, which made me feel uncomfortable, but I just brushed it off because I just simply didn’t know what to make of it. As we spoke, his dad was quickly pointing the 8-inch telescope toward Saturn, “Look here through the eyepiece. Tell me what you see.” I stepped up on the flat rock where the large telescope was positioned. 

When I looked through the telescope, I saw exactly what I expected to see…Saturn. It was exactly as I had seen in pictures before, a plain sphere with a ring around its circumference. It felt different, though…seeing it firsthand, only aided by a few layers of glass and mirrors. “Wow…it looks amazing…even better than the pictures!” “So…you can see it?” Mr. Wilkins continued to interrogate. I think I was starting to visibly tense up and back away at this point. I was just desperately confused by his reactions thus far. “Um…yeah?” I said shakily. 

   Mr. Wilkins sighed and turned back to normal, looking through each telescope intently and recording something in his journal which it took me until now to notice. What’s it to him if I can see Saturn or not? It’s probably like he said: I probably just have mild farsightedness that I’ve never noticed until now. I appreciated the concern, but the degree of his concern felt…unwarranted, I guess. Jared led me to his six-inch diameter telescope which he intently dialed and turned toward the other clear point that I could see, which was even brighter than Saturn. “Look…” he began suddenly, “…here’s Jupiter! You can see the storm real clearly tonight.” I didn’t know what exactly he meant by ‘storm’, so I naturally became more intrigued by whatever it was that was glowing inside the eyepiece. 

“Oh yeah…the red spot. I…never realized that was a storm” I said in restrained awe.“Oh…so that big red spot is a storm?” I inquired genuinely intrigued and temporarily forgot the strangeness of the situation. “Yeah! It’s been going for a few centuries now! And it probably won’t stop for another several hundred years!” Jared responded enthusiastically, trailing off again into a rant about the chemical compositions of Jupiter and the storms there, which I couldn’t hope to understand, but my eyes still widened and my skin still got chills. I thought at that moment that I had found my new fixation. 

For the next several hours, we scoured the sky, exhausting every point I could see. He kept telling me about the Milky Way which, although I knew I had seen before in pictures, was not visible to me now. “That doesn’t make any sense…” Jared continued, thoroughly baffled , “…it’s almost just as bright in the sky as Jupiter and Saturn out here, you should—“ “Jared!” His father shouted. “Enough of that! I’m sure Mr and Mrs Joles will take him to the eye doctor as soon as they head back to town. Let’s not bother him about it anymore, alright?” Mr. Wilkins’ voice was first firm and commanding, but increasingly became anxious and concerned. Jared meekly lowered his head and didn’t speak again for a few awkward minutes.

Mr. Wilkins then abruptly left the telescopes he had spent the past 30 minutes tuning to prepare our tents and sleeping bags. All the while, Jared continued to point out stars and constellations that, while I couldn’t see them, I nodded in agreement to satiate his father’s shrouded worry that I couldn’t quite place the source of. In fact, after a few more minutes, I had subconsciously committed to the role, taking out my phone as if to take a picture of the night sky. What was I thinking? I wasn’t going to see anything…but what if…? I tapped the camera icon on my phone and pointed it at the sky and, of course, nothing. “Oh…to capture a photo with your phone, you need to turn up the exposure to capture the light…” and Jared continued on as per usual. He tapped some more buttons on my camera app that otherwise would have laid dormant for all time, and then he instructed me to tap the picture button and stand very still. 

After about 10 seconds, the resulting picture appeared in my photo reel. And there it was! Just like I had seen in pictures before…the Milky Way Galaxy, shrouded in the familiar void and crowned by innumerable, obsolete stars. “I-I can see it!” I proclaimed in awe of what I was seeing. “That actually makes sense…” Jared explained, “if you are farsighted, the exposure-“ 

Mr. Wilkins’ face appeared in the entrance of one of the two tents set about 50 feet from the telescopes. His eyes pierced like a thousand needles into Jared’s and, for the first time since I had met him, he started crying, softly at first, but quickly becoming a bawl of torment. Hopelessly confused, I tried consoling him, but his strange panic began to rub off on me, “It’s really not a big deal at all…I’m sorry…I-I won’t bring it up again…I promise…Jared, you’re scaring me, stop!” 

“Jared...I think it’s time for you to get to bed.” Mr. Wilkins stated calmly, beckoning for him to enter the tent where he was.” It was early Summer, and Jared was visibly shaking as he walked slowly toward the tent. As he entered, he shot a glance at me that I can only describe as the look a dog gives when being made to enter a cage. Mr. Wilkins then turned to me after Jared entered the tent and said, “And Owen, the other tent is all yours. Jared will be staying with me tonight, and I apologize on his behalf for any…discomfort he may have caused you.” “N-no, really, it's nothing. It doesn’t bother me at all, but I’ll be sure to tell my parents about the eye doctor.” Mr. Wilkins quietly sighed in response and closed the tent.

An odd distance from their tent was mine, which looked exactly like the other, made of a dark black material which I assumed was to retain heat during the winter. When I opened the zipper to enter the tent, I noticed that there was something small in the middle of the tent in a bag with a folded sheet of paper on top. I crawled inside and read something neatly written on the visible side of the paper: ‘For your cough  -Thomas’ and inside the bag was a bottle of NyQuill, just enough for one dose. I laid down and took the syrup, then swiftly fell asleep. That night, as I had been accustomed to for several years, I awoke to a fit of sleep paralysis. I remember the first time I had sleep paralysis when I was ten and, when I told my mom about the experience, the explanation was obvious as it sounded much like other accounts: complete loss of physical control except for breathing and blinking, followed by the appearance of the ‘Visitor’ as I had come to call it, which I have come to find other people call a ‘sleep paralysis demon’.

It was all the same…at first, that is. I laid on the thin cushioning of the sleeping bag face-up without any control of my limbs for several minutes. Usually, it was only for several seconds. I had become accustomed to the phenomenon and had mastered remaining calm during these bouts. But now, I was beginning to panic much like I did the first time I ever experienced this. It felt…different, and I was starting to wonder if I had somehow broken my spine and permanently lost voluntary control of my body. 

But I knew panic could not help, so I laid there immobile, waiting for the sunrise and for Jared and Thomas to find me here. I counted about an hour, but the sunrise was still far off, and at that point, I saw the familiar form of the Visitor. A vague, black silhouette crouched above my paralyzed body. Usually, it would just stand there for a few seconds before I would wake and regain full control. However, this time, he reached down and touched my eyelids, spreading them open. Then, I saw a blinding flash and when I regained my sight, it was still there. Then came another flash quickly followed by more and, upon the third, or perhaps fourth flash, I was laying face-down in my bed at the new house.

Had I dreamed the whole scenario? That was the first thought that went through my head. Honestly, it sounded to me like something I would dream up. I would have just left it at that if it were not for the distinct, medicinal taste of the NyQuill in my mouth. Then came the next thought: my sleep paralysis last night…it was different somehow. Now that I had regained full cognition, I realized that the Visitor wasn’t the same. It was taller and more refined than it had been previously…and it had hands! It had never shown its hands before. Then, I led myself to the third and final thought: what had Thomas Wilkins given me last night? 

And before I had time to begin panicking, I heard the first faint wails of sirens. There were police heading up the county road. When I headed to the roadside window to get a better look, I encountered my parents in the living room. They were both staring blankly into the open room surrounded by boxes. When my mother took notice of me she lifted her head and gave a weak smile, “Hey, Owen…how are you feeling?” “I…feel fine, but- what? Wha-“ “We don’t know, not completely. Jared…he carried you back home on the ATV. We think his father had a mental break…the police are out there searching for him.” Mom began tearing up as she spoke, and her quiet sobs were covered up by the sound of approaching sirens. 

At this point, I looked out the window and noticed two cop cars already at the end of the street and combing the open wilderness for any trace of Mr. Wilkins. According to later reports, they searched on and around the path all the way up to Reiner’s Point. No sign of his whereabouts were discovered there. Over the next several days, law enforcement used aerial surveillance to search the surrounding 20 square miles. On the fourth day of searching, they found the rock ledge where Thomas was hiding under. He was found desperately carving lenses out of the bases of glass bottles and tying them together with twigs. 

When he was brought into custody, he practically admitted to everything. He had brought me out to the desert with the intention of feeding me NyQuill laced with a large dose of Diazepam to render me unconscious for reasons that he never stated under custody, but under further interrogation, he went on record to state, “I needed to look at his eyes.” That’s the only motive he ever gave. Three weeks after that night we went stargazing, Mr. Thomas Wilkins had been prosecuted on the grounds of child endangerment and was sentenced to 3 years in prison and 90 days of psychological rehabilitation. 

All the while, I had not forgotten about the family next door. They were victims as much as I was, and almost certainly more so. I mean, they lived with the guy! Who knows what kinds of sickening things he did that were not related to my case? My parents and I decided, after a grueling month of legal troubles, to visit the Wilkins’ home once more. This time, we brought the food: a tin of baked spaghetti. The whole time there was extremely tense. Not many words were spoken, but Jared and Mrs. Wilkins were clearly thankful for the food. After several minutes, Jared excused himself from the table, walking slowly back to his room on the other side of the house. My dad also excused himself and beckoned for me to step outside with him. I followed and he put his hand on my shoulder and said, “You better go and thank him, son. He probably saved your life that day. Okay?” 

“Alright” I responded. I really just didn’t want to make Jared more uncomfortable than he already was. He let me back inside and pointed me back to his room. The door to his room was closed, so I knocked and let myself in a few moments later. “Hey…I, uh, I just wanted to thank you…for…you know, back then.” Jared didn’t respond immediately. But after a few awkward moments, he lifted his head up to me and whispered shakily, “Owen…you're not farsighted. You have Prophet’s Syndrome.”",27,0.91,4,Connect-Committee-56,2024-11-06 12:14:06,1gl507e,31,High
NoSleep,My fleshgait encounter,"I had been homeless for 2 years when I found the “Shady Acre” Apartments complex. Before that I had been sleeping under roadways and behind dumpsters which were some of the lowest points in my life. Having found the mostly completed apartments being abandoned before they were officially completed was like hitting the jackpot for someone like me. Tucked away in a cleared lot nestled against the woods on the slower part of town, the Shady Acres acres were a complex for newer families and lower income individuals but somehow it found itself never being finally completed. The walls were not painted and the flooring were not installed but aside from the minor features, the place was practically livable. Of course the electric wasn't working alongside the water and plumbing but as the saying goes, “Beggars can't be choosers”. I peaked my head inside as I entered the first floor. Tools,materials and odds and ends still layed strewn about as if someone was going to come back to finish the job or at least clean up their mess but it appeared that no one ever did. I grabbed a sizable pipe laying on the ground just in case. Homeless people, if startled can and will turn violent very quickly. I did a brief inspection of the main floor, peaking my head inside of ways to confirm that I was alone in a substantially sized building but sure enough, I couldnt find anyone else. 

As I inspected the main floor I found a stairway. A metal door once stood in the way but now layed on the ground. It was clear that someone damaged it with some type of tool in order to keep it open.

I went to the stairway and looked inside. The natural light provide by the sun aided by the many open windows could only spill over so much. Inside was a set of stairs going but both upwards and down below. I didnt have a flashlight but what little natural sun entered the stairway was just enough to give me the courage to explore upwards. Giving off just enough light to give me courage to see the second floor. I went up the metal stairs quietly so as to not alarm anyone else to my presence here. The second floor was nearly identical to the first. I walked down the halls gripping the pipe, ready to defend myself from an unknown attacker. Again, much like the first floor, I didnt see anyone However I did find troubling signs of people having lived here at one point. I saw an old mattress littered with trash and old cigarettes. Clothes tossed in a pile in the corner of the room. Several dark stains covered the floor and one splattered on the wall next to the head of the mattress. My heart sank. It was more than likely something sinister had been committed here. I was going to turn to leave but alongside the disheartening evidence of someone being here, I found a flashlight and an old pistol. I took both and checked the gun to see 3 bullets remaining in the cylinders.  

I was going to leave but seeing now that I had a gun and a flashlight, this changes things. The flashlight worked perfectly, emitting a strong blue led light on the stained wall when I clicked it on. I still kept the pipe with me as a back up but the pistol was now gripped firmly in my right hand. The second floor had bits and pieces of trash here and there but nothing as concerning than what was in that one room. I entered the stairwell with my flashlight guiding me. Unlike the first two floors the third floor had an actual door standing at the entrance. Lucky for me, the handle turned slowly and granted me access. A quick inspection of the door revealed a marvelous find. This door could be locked from the inside. If this floor was clear, this would be a magnificent set up. I could lock the door and prevent any vagrants much like myself coming up here and killing me in my sleep. All I would have to do is verify that the floor was clear and I would be all set. 

The third floor had varied greatly from the first 2. No bits of drywall on the floor or discarded nails laying haphazardly. There still wasnt electricity but nothing my new flashlight couldnt handle. The floor was unfinished but oddly clean as if it was getting prepped for carpet or new flooring before this place shut down. I cleared each room slowly, making sure to check every closet and cupboard before finally letting my guard down. I went back to the stairway and locked the door to prevent anyone else from coming up. I picked a room facing the parking lot that way I could look out and see if anyone was coming. 

I spent the rest of the day in my new found home. The flashlight and gun were an amazing find but that unsettling sight of the blood stained floor and walls was something that still concerned me. Maybe it was something else, perhaps someone spilled something and it just looked bad? I thought to myself trying to not freak myself out so much. The thought also crept into my mind about how I yet to inspected the basement and what horrors lurked down there. For being homeless, I was fairly paranoid. I made myself a game plan for tomorrow that I would go out and find cheap furniture and food to fill my barebone apartment. It would take several trips but well worth the effort. 

Night time and boredom eventually found me. I sat in the corner of the room trying to get comfortable and let sleep carry me into tomorrow but it was difficult. Sure enough I managed to fall asleep but staying asleep was another story. I woke up in the middle of the night, I didnt have anything to check the time with but it was several hours before the sun would be rising. I got up feeling the urge to go to the bathroom. This complex didnt have running water so I would have to go outside to relieve myself. I grabbed the gun and flashlight and walked over to the stariway and unlocked the door. I went down the 2 flights of stairs and walked out back to go to the bathroom. The back of the complex was as neglected as the complex itself. Tall weeds filled the field that stretched out to the dark trees. Moonlight was scarce and a cool chill breezed over me as I went to the bathroom. I glanced at the complex as I did my business. Anxiety had yet to find me as I was still sleepy. I could hear cars off in the distance from the nearby highway but no animal life could be heard. It was probably too cold for them, I thought as I pulled my pants up and made my way inside. I entered the hollow shell of the first floor. 

Stealth was not my main concern seeing as that sleep was my only goal. I entered the stairway, ready to ascend back up to my room of safety when I stopped. For the briefest of moments, I could have sworn I heard what sounded like mumbling down below. My flashlight was on but I didnt dare shine it down into the basement. In fact, a moment curiosity washed over me as I turned my light off and listened in the stairway. I gripped the gun as I stepped over to the stairs that led downwards. My suspicions were confirmed as I felt my way down a step or two to hear more clearly the rambling of someone down here. I paused for a moment, unsure of what to do. Whoever was down here sounded as if they were speaking and no one else was responding. Perhaps a mentally ill person took shelter down here. 

I walked back up the stairs silently as the soft mumblings of whoever was down there slowly faded beneath the stairs. I was fairly fit and mentally strong so having an interaction with anyone would be more likely in my favor. I made it to the third floor and the sound was no longer existent. It was clear that the distance between us had enough cushion to drown out the sounds from either of us which was relieving. I made sure to lock the door to the stairway before heading back to my room. Although the realization I wasnt alone in this building was brief and honestly quite harmless, it made finding sleep all the more difficult. I dont know if I slept much that night but I woke up feeling very tired. 

I got up and glance out the window to see the complex parking lot empty and the sun beaming over the distant trees. I unlocked the stairway door and went down the stairs and outside. I spent the day in town getting things ready for my new place. The local thrift store had a cheap air mattress that I purchased but it didnt come with a pump. I loaded up with other essentials like huge gallon sized jugs of water and food that was easy to make or didnt require power. After making a trip or two back to the empty complex, my room was decent enough for me to not have to worry about it for a week or so. The only thing I wasn't able to work out was the bath room situation which would require me to go down the sets of stairs and out back facing the woods. 

I was going to go in the basement later that day but got caught up doing other things and by the time I was available the sun had set. This wouldnt affect the actual lighting of the basement obviously but I didnt want to face whatever was down there and come up to a pitch black night. Besides, whoever was down there didnt seem aware of me or my setup and that was enough comfort for me to leave that problem to another day. I made sure to use the bathroom around back before going back up to my room. I didnt want to have to make the hike in the middle of the night again. While I was using the restroom, I peered out into the woods several hundred yards away. I wasnt sure how long I would be able to keep up the abandoned apartment situation so I briefly considered checking out the woods as a back up if I were to be found out. 

Again that would be another task that I would save for daylight. The woods seemed just as terrifying as the dark basement below. I went back inside, flashlight in hand. As I approached the stairwell I notice that on the ground, dark streaks of a mysterious liquid leading down the stairs. The stains mixed with the unfinished floor looked ominous. It was hard to tell what exactly it was but didnt like what I was seeing. I turned my light off as I entered the stairway, as to not alert who was below. I made sure to be quiet but my pace was quicker than what it probably should have been. I opened the third floor door and locked it behind me. I did a quick inspection of the third floor as a safety precaution but everything looked how I left it. 

I was tired from all the walking. Mainly having to carry all my stuff around and setting up my room took all my energy. I laid on my air mattress and closed my eyes, trying not to think about anything as sleep began to grab hold of my consciousness when a faint noise jarred me awake. It was subtle but my mind being on high alert was able to detect movement down below. Normally, I wouldnt have heard whatever was down beneath rummaging around but since the complex didnt have windows to insulate the noise, I could clearly hear the sound of someone walking around. The shuffling wasnt terribly loud but whatever it was was clearly working its way up the complex. What concerned me wasnt the noise itself but rather how things sounded. There was a hint of stealth in the movements. Like whoever it was didnt want to be detected. I followed the sounds beneath me as I laid in darkness. I lost track of where they had went when they were over near the stairwell. I sat up on my mattress and looked in the direction of the stairwell. Did I lock the door to the stairs? I thought. I had been so busy that day that it was very likely I forgot. I got up slowly, doing my best to keep my sound low. In my hurry, I only brought my flashlight to guide me through the dark halls. I quickly made it to the stairway door and tugged on the handle. I had remembered. I breathed a sigh of relief and turned my light off. I sat by the door, my nerves slowly getting worked up. I need to stop over thinking, I whispered as I sat in silence after spending 15 minutes trying to locate the sound beneath me. I was ready to get up and head back to my bed when a jostling of the door handle startled me. 

Someone was outside of the door. A brief rustling on the handle shocked my anxiety as I sat in darkness. I could hear someone talking to themselves but the handle had stopped shaking. Whoever was on the other side had stopped their attempt to gain entry but still stood outside the door. I stared at the door petrified of what would happen if the door lock no longer held. Would it be just another person like me, seeking refuge and wanting to spend the night with a roof over their head or was this something else. 

The person on the other side of the door left the door almost immediately but still stayed within the complex. Fear gripped me to that door, not allowing me to move. It was clear that this building had another uninvited guest but that wouldnt last. As I was debating on how to proceed, I heard another sound but this one didnt come from the other side of the door but beneath me. The piercing sound of a shriek filled the complex. Whoever had the misfortune of finding themselves on the lower levels began to shuffle around. They tried to get to the first floor but I could hear a struggle then more screaming coming from the stairway. 

The sound of commotion erupted. Screams of pain and terror echoed up the stairwell but not for long. The screams quickly died and the sound of something being dragged slowly faded down into the basement below. I couldnt be sure but it sounded as if I just heard a murder take place. I sat by the stairway all night. Eyes wide. I couldnt bring myself to calm down enough to enjoy the luxury of sleep. When the sun finally rose, I found the courage to get up and head to my room. I didnt go outside that day despite having the urgent need of using the bathroom. I ended up using an empty room and designated that as my bathroom area until I figured out how to get out of this place. I had enough food and water to last me a couple of days so I had time to figure out what I wanted to do. During the day sleep finally overcame me and I drifted to a realm of peace but that wouldnt last. I woke up later in the day. The sun was completely smothered behind rain clouds and loud rumblings of thunder rolled in the distance. I could hear a few droplets hit the roof and window sill, a prelude of what was to come. The complex was much darker now. My flashlight was needed for just about everything. The day was only going to get darker so I had to decide. Stay another night and hope that I can evade notice for 10 or so more hours or sneak my way out of here. 

 I grabbed the pistol and decided to try my luck. I packed up as much stuff as I could carry in one take and headed for the stairs. I made my way over to the door and unlocked it. My light beaming into the thick darkness below. I made sure to check the coast was clear before leaving my sanctuary. I slowly descended the stairs. Doing my best to navigate the metal stairs while also keeping my noise down. I slowly completed the first flight of steps and nothing seemed out of place. On the second floor, my fears had been confirmed. I could see drag marks leading to the stairs with stains accompanying it. I wanted to check the second floor but my nerves wouldn't allow it. The drag marks continued down the step leaving thick stain of blood and bits and pieces of guts. This wasnt just a killing. This was a mutilation. Whoever had done this was disturbed and they last person I wanted to encounter in this dark stairway. 

I needed to leave. The rain had really begun to come down now. I would get soaked the second I stepped foot outside but I had to do it. I was frustrated by those new development since I would not be able to hear as well if something was heading towards my direction. 

I worked my way down to the first floor but halfway down, my light reached something at the bottom of the stairs that stopped me cold in my tracks. Standing in the corner of the stairway next to the exit stood an absolute horrid creature stood hunched facing the corner. My light only caught the lower half of the figure before I turned off my light but it was enough for me to piece it together. The brief moment of horror revealed “Something” blocking my exit. Had it not been standing I would have that it was rotted corpse. Flesh peeled from what limbs I could see and bone appeared to jet out of the lower spine. I didnt get to see the rest of it and im kind of glad I didnt. I held my breath as my heart began to race. I was immersed in darkness with whatever this thing was about a dozen or so feet away from me. Rain and thunder continued outside now thankfully concealing my sound. 

I couldnt see anything but what little I could hear, it didnt sound like it had moved. I stood petrified on the stairs, knowing fully well I wasnt going to make it out of here this way, at least in one piece. In moments like this you dont really think clearly. You can only think of survival and nothing else. I had never seen anything like this before. I wasnt sure what kind of gun I had or if it would even affect this creature in any meaningful way but I wasnt going to test it.

I began to back step up the stairs awkwardly. My hands were full and my heavy pack made the unnatural back peddling even more difficult. I went for another step back when my shoe didnt clear the step and I fell backwards. Out of reaction I dropped my gun and flashlight to brace myself. Reaching out for non-existent handle rails to catch my fall. The thud of the heavy flashlight on the metal stairs clamored loudly as it fell down the stairs echoing in the stairwell.

I gasped. A shock of anxiety and dread flooded my system. Without a doubt I had gained the attention of whatever lurked just beneath me. I dropped my backpack to lighten my load and felt around for the gun. Shrieks filled the complex as an odd twist of event, it would appear that I had startled whatever was down there. I could hear shuffling beneath me. Its attention focused briefly on the flashlight that came to a stop, buying me precious time to find my only weapon to defend myself. I felt around, my hands padding the ground, feeling the still wet stains of the drag marks from earlier. I was so focused on finding the gun I hadn't noticed the creature was no longer interested in the flashlight and had begun ascending the stairs. 

Finally I felt something solid and gripped it tightly. It took me a few moments to orient myself with the weapon but before I could I was tackled on the ground. Immediately, I felt sharp pain in my side as I was now being attacked. I could feel claws begin to slash on my outer coat and heavy pressure on my chest. I pressed the barrel in the direction I heard shrieking and felt something solid. I pulled the trigger 3 times and my hand knocked back from the power. The gun bursts briefly illuminated the area. And flashes of images haunted my vision. I could briefly see in those very few moments what appeared to be a decomposing demon. It was so quick and I was in so much pain that I wasnt able to process everything right then. The pressure relieved off my chest as it seemed I had injured my attacker. However I still heard movement squirming around on the ground and loud horrifying screams. I left the gun and my backpack with stuff and ran past the sounds of shuffling. I went to the stairs and went as quickly as I could without falling in the dark. The pain in my side seemed to disappear as adrenalin began to pump into my system. I made it to the first floor and I kicked the flashlight that I had dropped earlier. I picked it up and turned it on and ran out of there. 

I left the complex with whatever that was still screaming inside. The warm rain slowly drenching me the further I jogged away. The screams never did stop. The just muffled the further I went off into the dark rainy night. As I got a good distance away, a part of me considered looking back to see if my demonic attacker was pursuing me but not looking back would be a risk I was willing to take.

NoSleep,Willsborough,"I thought it was a prank when I found the door. Nothing in my apartment building had ever stood out, not in the three years I’d lived here. So, when I discovered a new laundry room at the end of my floor’s hallway, I was more confused than anything.

The door was heavy, old-looking, with a metal handle worn smooth. It shouldn’t have been there. Our laundry room was on the basement level, and I knew every inch of this hallway. But that night, after a double shift at work, I was too exhausted to argue with my own curiosity.

The door groaned as I pushed it open, and I swear it smelled like burnt plastic mixed with something sweet and rotten, like fruit left out in the sun. I don’t know why I walked in, or why I didn’t turn around when I felt a wave of nausea hit. All I know is that, in one step, everything changed.

I wasn’t in my building anymore.

The air felt heavier, thicker, and the walls were grimy, covered in streaks of something dark and sticky. It was the same hallway layout, but the colors were off, a sickly yellow cast that came from dim, buzzing lights overhead. I didn’t recognize anything, but part of me thought it was a weird dream, that maybe I’d fallen asleep in the hallway.

Then I saw the first person.

A woman shuffled out of a nearby door, her face gaunt, with deep sunken eyes and skin so pale it looked like paper. Her clothes were rags, hanging off her like they were too heavy. She looked at me with empty, hollow eyes, then tilted her head. I took a step back, instinctively.

“You got any spare?” she croaked, her voice barely a whisper.

“Spare…?” I stammered.

“Something to trade,” she replied, her eyes flicking to a bundle in her arms. I hadn’t noticed it before—a small, wriggling shape wrapped in what looked like dirty towels. I realized with a sickening jolt that it was a baby, crying weakly.

I backed away, horrified. “I—I don’t have anything. I don’t even know where I am.”

Her mouth twisted into a snarl, and I took off down the hallway, heart pounding in my ears. The world outside my building should have been the familiar street view, but instead, the sky was an unnatural shade of red, casting an eerie glow over everything. It was Willsborough, all right—there was the old gas station at the end of the road—but everything was in ruins. Crumbling buildings lined the street, graffiti scrawled in languages I didn’t recognize, and trash piled high in the gutters. The smell was worse out here, like decay.

As I wandered, it became clear that this wasn’t my town. At least, not anymore.

Everywhere I looked, people were bartering strange, twisted items for things I couldn’t comprehend: scraps of plastic, chunks of rusted metal, jars filled with what looked like teeth. The worst was when I saw a man in a tattered suit hand over a wailing infant to another man in exchange for a small vial filled with a thick, amber liquid. The man held it up to the light and took a long, savoring sip, his eyes closing in satisfaction.

I must have stared too long, because he looked at me, his eyes narrowing. I ducked around the corner, my mind racing. This couldn’t be real. This was… some kind of nightmare, right?

But then I saw my own reflection in a broken store window, and it was me—tired, terrified, wearing my work uniform and clutching my phone like a lifeline. It was all real.

As I stumbled further into this nightmarish version of my town, I noticed a group of people huddled around a street corner, murmuring in low voices. One of them saw me and nudged the others. They all turned at once, like a pack of animals catching the scent of prey. Their faces were gaunt, their skin stretched tight over their bones. The tallest of them grinned, his teeth sharpened to points.

“Fresh meat,” he rasped, and they began to approach me slowly, like they were savoring the moment.

I backed away, ready to bolt, but they were faster than they looked. One of them lunged, grabbing my arm in a vice grip. I struggled, feeling his claws dig into my skin as he pulled me closer, his breath hot and sour against my neck. I kicked, thrashed, anything to get free, but the others circled me, their eyes hungry.

Just as I felt his teeth graze my skin, there was a bright, blinding flash.

Then… I was back in the hallway. The normal one, outside my apartment door.

I scrambled back, my chest heaving as I looked around, but everything was just as it should be. The peeling wallpaper, the faint hum of the heater, the soft fluorescent light. No sickly yellow glow, no smell of decay. Just… home.

But there was something wrong.

My arm was still bleeding from where the man had grabbed me, deep red lines seeping through my shirt. I touched it, half-expecting it to be gone, just a phantom pain from the nightmare. But it hurt—badly. And then, I noticed the smell. That same sickly sweet odor from the laundry room, lingering around me.

I thought I’d escaped, that I was safe. But when I went to type this all out, my phone pinged with a notification.

It was a message from an unknown number. I clicked it open, hands shaking.

*“We know you’re here.”*

Another notification buzzed in.

*“See you at 3:33.”*

I dropped my phone. The screen stayed lit, the message glaring back at me, impossible to ignore. I don’t know what’s going to happen when the clock strikes 3:33. I’m afraid to find out.

And I don’t know if I’ll be here to tell you what happens next.",62,0.95,2,jay33d,2024-11-05 22:19:17,1gkq1yd,64,High
NoSleep,The Arcadian Hotel Night Attendant Training Tapes - Part 2,"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ghasze/the_arcadian_hotel_night_attendant_training_tapes/)

it’s been a few nights since I last posted, and... well, a lot has happened. I’ve been following the rules as best I can, but for every answer I find, it feels like two more questions take its place. Working these night shifts has my mind in knots, with every night bleeding into the next until I can barely remember what day it is. I’ve seen things, things that don’t add up, things I can’t explain away. And yet, here I am, showing back up night after night. I want to quit, but I’ve made more money in the past few nights than I have working an entire two weeks at other jobs.

Night two was mostly uneventful.

Ronald made his usual appearance; same dull uniform, same shuffle to the front desk and repeating the right phrase, “I’m here to clean the mess”. I tried to stay out of his way, and everything seemed calm, until I noticed that key 309 was missing again. Sticking to the rules, I made my way to the kitchen. It was still stocked with fresh ingredients, which I still can’t wrap my head around. Who’s restocking this stuff? Shaking it off, I made a simple ham and cheese, then took the elevator up to the third floor. The ritual continued as usual: I knocked, kept my gaze down, and waited. The door creaked open, and this time, the person lingered in the doorway longer than before, like they were waiting for me to make eye contact. I held my ground until I heard the door shut slowly. On my way back, I skipped the elevator altogether. No way was I risking a detour to the basement again. I took the stairs instead, counting each step down, hoping nothing else would happen.

After night two ended without any major surprises, I felt a spark of confidence. Just follow the rules, take the stairs down, don’t overthink it, maybe this gig was simpler than I thought. By the time night three rolled around, I showed up feeling a lot more assured, already $500 richer, and convinced I had cracked the code. I had this in the bag, or so I thought.

But as soon as I settled in for my shift, it became clear that night three had other plans for me.

Not long after I started my shift, Ronald made his entrance. I felt a bit relieved to see him. There was something reassuring about having someone else around, even if he wasn’t exactly chatty company. But that night, Ronald seemed... different. His uniform looked freshly pressed, like he’d actually taken care to look sharp, and his usual sluggish walk had turned into a brisk stride. When he reached the desk, he looked at me with a strange grin and said, “Time to get this place spick and span!” I froze. Ronald had always said the same phrase, without fail. My mind scrambled, trying to remember what the rules said about this. He kept staring, his grin unwavering, eyes locked on me like he was waiting for something. Then it hit me: “No cleaning needed tonight, Ronald.” As soon as I said it, his smile fell, his expression darkening. Through gritted teeth, he repeated his phrase, “It’s time... to get this place... spick... and span”. With adrenaline beginning to pump through my body, I repeated with a shaky voice, “No cleaning needed tonight, Ronald.” He finally backed away, slowly, staring at me with hatred until he reached the door. I waited until he was gone and locked it tight behind him.

After Ronald left, I stood there, my pulse hammering as I tried to process what had just happened. What the hell was that? Ronald’s strange behavior, his creepy demeanor, wide smile, fresh clothes, what was wrong with him? What's wrong with this whole place, for that matter? I thought I had things figured out, but now I wasn’t so sure. I began to question if I’d really be able to handle whatever else this hotel had in store. That confidence I’d felt at the beginning of the night was fading fast.

That night, I decided it was time to get a better sense of this place. The rules and strange encounters had thrown me off balance, and I thought that maybe exploring a bit would help me make sense of it all. Armed with my master key, I left the desk behind and wandered down the corridors. Being the only person in a giant hotel felt unnatural, the silence broken only by the sounds made by my feet. I passed rows of tarnished brass fixtures and faded wallpaper, remnants of a once-grand elegance that had long since slipped away.

On the second floor, I found the ballroom, a huge echoing space that seemed frozen in time. Dust coated every surface, and a once-sparkling chandelier hung above, its crystals now clouded and covered in cobwebs. I ran my hand along the edge of a table covered in a fine layer of dust, my fingers leaving tracks as if no one had touched it in decades. For a moment, I tried to imagine what the place must have looked like in its heyday. Just as I turned to leave, I heard a sound on the other side of the room, by the bar. I turned around, half-expecting someone, or something, to be waiting behind me, but there was nothing. I slowly backed out of the room with an intense feeling of being watched.

As I continued my tour, I noticed that most rooms unlocked easily with the master key. But a few doors, oddly, wouldn’t budge. I tried the key, jiggling it and pushing, but it was as if these doors were meant to stay closed, resisting every attempt to pry them open.

As I moved up to the seventh floor, I passed by a particular room that made me stop in my tracks. I could hear a soft voice from within the room. I froze, heart pounding as I leaned in to listen. The voice was faint but unmistakable; someone was inside. As I was straining to hear it, the voice abruptly stopped. My breath caught, and I took a step back, every instinct screaming at me to leave. As I backed away, I heard heavy footsteps approach the door and stop. Looking at the door, I couldn’t help but feel like whoever it was, was looking at me through the peephole. I thought I saw the doorknob twitch, just the faintest movement, as though someone inside was reaching for it. “Nope” I told myself, and I hurried down the hall, leaving the floor entirely. I tried to convince myself it was my imagination. But either way, I had no desire to stick around and find out. 

After exploring the eighth floor, I made my way up to the ninth, which looked just like the others, dimly lit and lined with old doors. I had seen enough for one night. The thought of a long journey down the stairs back to the lobby loomed ahead, but it felt like a welcome return to familiarity. As I turned to head toward the stairwell, I caught a glimpse of my reflection in a mirror mounted on the wall.

Looking at myself in the mirror, I couldn’t help but notice how tired and beat-down I looked. As I was examining myself, almost looking at myself with pity, I saw something else in the mirror. Behind me, down the hall, I saw *someone* else. A figure standing far behind me at the other end of the hall, peaking at me from around the corner. My stomach dropped, a cold knot tightening in my gut as fear washed over me. I whipped around, heart racing, but the hallway was empty. I turned back to the mirror, my breath hitching in my throat, and there it was again, the figure still there, peeking at me from around the corner. It was too far down the hallway to make out any of its features, but it was unmistakable. Suddenly, I remembered the rule, “don’t look into any mirrors after midnight”. Checking my phone, there it was, 1:23, a.m. *Shit, shit, shit*, I thought. I burst through the doors of the stairwell and made my way down the nine flights of stairs as quickly as I could.

Finally, back at my desk, I sank into the chair, my heart still racing and my breath heavy from the frantic descent down the stairs. I decided to stay put for the rest of the night, unwilling to venture out again. The hours crept by slowly, but the rest of the night was thankfully uneventful. The sun was beginning to rise, and with my shift over, I clocked out, a fresh $500 check in hand. Relief flooded over me as I thought about the safety of the morning outside and another night successfully in the books. As I was turning to leave though, I noticed something.

An error. A mistake. Key 309 had been missing, and I never noticed. I never brought the guest of room 309 a ham sandwich. Yet, with morning breaking and my shift officially over, I shrugged it off, telling myself it was too late to go back now.

When I finally got home, exhaustion weighed heavily on me. I collapsed onto my bed, desperate to catch some sleep after the long night at the hotel. But sleep never comes easily after working the night shift. The unnatural hours play tricks on my body. Even with blackout curtains pulled tight against the early morning light, I tossed and turned, restless and unable to fully escape the haunting images of the night. The figure in the mirror, Ronald's strange appearance, and the voice in the room. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something is seriously wrong, and that the hotel is somehow seeping into my mind. On the bright side, the money I’m making allowed me to catch up on bills and finally start paying down my loans, a small victory amid the growing unease. With little sleep to show for my efforts, I begrudgingly pulled myself up and got ready for another shift, bracing myself for whatever the night would throw my way.

When I arrived at the hotel for my next shift, a note was waiting for me on the desk:

 

*We would like to take a moment to address an important matter regarding your recent shift. It has come to our attention that the guest in Room 309 did not experience the high level of service we strive to provide. As you know, adhering to our established rules and protocols is vital for ensuring an exceptional experience for our guests, safeguarding the esteemed reputation of the Arcadian Hotel, and maintaining your own safety. We would like to remind you of the importance of following the rules.*

*In light of this, we would urge you to avoid the kitchen at all costs for the next 24 hours.*

*Additionally, we are pleased to announce that the hotel will soon undergo renovations as part of our commitment to restoring the grandeur of the Arcadian Hotel. The Arcadian Hotel will be preparing for a new Grand Opening in the coming weeks.*

*Thank you for your dedication to the legacy of the Arcadian.*

*Management*

 

As I read through the letter, a surge of anger bubbled within me. “It’s just a damn ham sandwich,” I muttered under my breath. The implications of the note twisted my stomach into knots. What did they mean by ""my safety"". Avoid the kitchen? Why? A wave of confusion washed over me as I replayed the past few nights in my head. The rules seemed increasingly strange, and their vague warnings started to feel more like threats than guidance. It felt like a game I was losing, like I was just a pawn in a strange, unsettling scheme.

Every time I’ve been ready to quit, the money has made me hang on, just a little longer. Just enough to really make a difference in my life. To finally be ahead.

Just as I was stewing in my frustration, Ronald shuffled in, back to his usual shabby self. His uniform was wrinkled, and he moved with his familiar, slow shuffle. For a fleeting moment, a wave of hope washed over me at the sight of him. “I’m here to clean the mess” he said. His familiar routine felt like a comforting. Maybe tonight would be okay after all, I thought.

As Ronald was getting his cleaning supplies ready, I finally worked up the courage to approach him. ""Hey, Ronald, can I ask you something? What was with you last night? You seemed… different. And what's the deal with all these rules? What are they really for?""

At my words, Ronald shot me a sharp look, his expression darkening. ""Listen, kid,"" he said, his voice low and serious. ""You don’t go looking for answers. You don’t go asking questions. Just stick to your job, follow the rules, collect your money, and keep your head down. It’s for your own good."" His quickly looked around, his eyes flickering with a hint of fear. He then turned away, leaving me with a knot of unease in my stomach, and more questions.

The rest of the night was spent behind my desk. All keys were accounted for, I avoided the kitchen, and nothing else strange happened. Another $500 in the bank, another night down. Follow the rules, collect the money, I reminded myself.

And I thought I could handle it. The basement, the mirror, the strange noises. I thought I had dealt with the worst of it. That was, until last night.",176,0.98,9,Weird-Suggestion-152,2024-11-05 11:31:15,1gkc7ou,185,High
NoSleep,My brother followed me here,"
Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/f2PqOIUSq6

11-3
I have no idea what's happening but I feel like im going to lose my mind. I have been taking sleeping pills but it doesn't help. I still see him in my dreams. I see that little fuck waiting for me under the sink in the pantry.

Police have been checking on me and Julie pretty regularly. We're staying at her parents house right now up in Ipswitch MA. I like to tell myself will come all the way from NC but something tells me he's willing to do anything. Why? Or to achieve what I don't fucking know yet. 

But I keep having these dreams every night. I'll try to explain it but it sounds fucking ridiculous I don't know. I usually wake up in a forest covered in dirt with a sharp pain in my chest. There's always this screeching off in the trees. Next to me is a big stone pot but evertime I try to look inside it I wake up. If anyone knows what it might mean please tell me.

Me and Julie have been going on walks she said it should help clear my head. I honestly don't know if it helps. She's the only thing that can really keep my head clear. Her parents house isn't really close to town it's off a path in the woods but it's quiet, peaceful, open. There's alot of wildlife mostly deer and birds. I've been so on edge lately Julie has been trying anything to calm me down. She'll stay up with me when I can't fall asleep even though I tell her not to. This land is beautiful if I wasn't losing my shit this would be the perfect place to propose.

Fuck. God damn it I knew I wasn't being paranoid. He's here.

We were watching a movie The Fly one of my favorites. Then the whole house started smelling fucking horrible. The unmistakable sharp sour smell of something dead. I looked around the house frantic holding an axe in my hands ready for that little fuck. Julie was trying to calm me down get me to stop but I wouldn't I couldn't not until I found him. But I didn't find him just the source of the smell. In the kitchen packages of frozen food scattered all over the tile. Julie already had her hand on the freezer door I held the axe high above my head ready to end this.

The door flew open at her slightest pull and the whole house was filled with the piercing cries of a baby dear. Mangled and bloody it's body twisted and broken like some broken toy having been hastily crammed into the freezer. Julie weeped covering her eyes. With every desperate cry from the deer blood gushed out of its mouth and joints painting the tile in a deep crimson. I took a deep breathe reached over and grabbed a knife from the drawer. I quickly pushed it into the poor things chest ending it misery.

I argued with the police for what felt like hours I hated the idea of staying here. He knows that we're here I insisted. But the brain dead fucking donut munchers claimed that I lashed out on the deer after it broke in due to my considerable mental strain. Julie sat upstairs crying, I felt horrible, she shouldn't have had to see that. After the police left and I cleaned the kitchen I went to our room defeated and fell asleep faster than I had in a week. I had another dream.

This one was more vivid I felt in control. I tried to wake up telling myself I was dreaming but the more I thought it the less I believed it. That screamed pierced through the air. But this time it called my name, this time I could tell it was Julie. I shot up to run but woke up.

I got out of bed checked all the locks on doors and windows. The vents too especially the fucking vents. I kept the door to our bedroom locked and the axe by the bed. I layed down next to Julie and wept.

NoSleep,"I discovered something grotesque in the archives of the university I work at, and I don’t think it wanted to be found, because it got personal really fast [Part 2].","Click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g5gdob/i_discovered_something_grotesque_in_the_archives/) to read part 1.

This post will be a bit shorter than the first one, but I am confident of what I need to do next and will keep on updating you guys until I get to the bottom of the situation. I feel as if finding and listening to these songs has unleashed some kind of evil presence into my life. Whatever it is, it’s been haunting me in ways that become more obvious and frequent with time. At home, I constantly find things out of place that I know I didn’t move, things like my keys, books and frames fall to the floor with no explanation, the smoke alarm has gone off a couple of times and I’ve been experiencing sleep paralysis pretty much every night.

Worst of all, I hear noises of something or someone moving around in my house. This happens at all hours of the day - I hear things in plain daylight and they also wake me up in the middle of the night. I’ve searched the house multiple times but there’s never any evidence of anyone having been there other than me.

It all sounds so cliché - hell, I’ve even thought about bringing a priest over, even though I’m not a very religious person. I don’t know what to do other than trying to get to the bottom of where this music comes from.

I previously mentioned how the songs that I found in the old USB have been changing in different ways - in order to gain some clarity and assurance, I decided to do some formal testing of the different mutations that I have noticed so far.

Despite my analytical and technological limitations, I’ve tried to be as scientific as possible and the results have been undeniably unnatural. I should mention that the results I’ll be posting will be limited. I do not want to get into any legal issues with the university, or worse, to reveal my identity. Having said that, I am willing to take a few small liberties because as far as I know, these songs have not been formally published and I have not found anything online regarding the origins of the project.

First I focused on the issue of time. As you know, the songs have been changing in length - I did some tests with two different computers to isolate and explore the issue in more detail. I transferred one of the songs that had been changing the most with an external drive from my laptop to the main computer that is used in the university’s recording studio. I’m friends with the engineer there and he helped me to set up an A/B comparison.

In all my days of being around recording sessions, I had never been so terrified by the idea of an A/B.

Normally I love these. They are usually set up for exciting and interesting comparisons between two different takes, mixes or masters. You can really get a sense of the incredible depth that lies below the surface of sound and how small differences can have profound emotional impact on the listening experience. Sometimes, whether a song is truly great comes down to the tiniest bit of difference in certain levels or frequencies. Sound is a beautiful and deep thing that I’ve always thought to be sacred, but this is something else. This is about something profane and corrupted. I opened the exact same file with the same audio software on both computers and set their playback markers to zero and pressed play on both computers at the same time. Nothing out of the ordinary happened - the songs played normally and were in sync. I tried with a few more songs from the folder, but everything seemed to be ok. I wasn’t about to give up.

I went back and played the songs again from the top. Multiple times. Nothing.

It was getting late. I could tell that my friend was growing impatient, especially since I was purposefully vague about what I was looking for. I didn’t feel like I could just come out and say what I was testing for without sounding like a complete nut job. He was beginning to worm around in his seat and sighing loudly. After a few minutes, he said he was going to check out for the night but that I could stay back and continue looking for whatever it was I needed to find. He gave me instructions on how to turn off the studio equipment and lock up. He wished me luck and headed out.

Things changed almost immediately after he left - I started to feel very uneasy and anxious. I was the only person left at the studio and there was a heaviness in the air that hadn’t been there before. I tried to distract myself by continuing my tests. I wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible. That’s when it happened.

One of the songs I had previously tested started to phase out, as if they were recorded at different speeds.

I quickly stopped the tracks and played a different track (some generic beat I found online) in order to make sure that it wasn’t a sample rate issue or anything of the sort. That played fine. But something else happened again that has been freaking me out since a few days ago. The green light belonging to the front facing camera of my laptop turned on. It’s happened a few times already and I never have any other programs opened that would even use the camera. I quickly put some tape over the camera and thought about what to do next. I could go home, or I could continue with the tests to see if I found anything else. I decided to stay a bit longer since it’s not like going home would be any more comforting.

I imported another song on both computers and pressed play. This time the rhythm wasn’t phasing, but I began to hear something I hadn’t heard before coming from the speakers that made my blood curdle - it was screaming. It wasn’t very clear so I put up the master volume on the console and leaned in a bit closer. It wasn’t just one voice. It was like a choir of screaming voices. They were starting to get louder.

I tried to stop both tracks but neither keyboard was responding. I brought down the fader on the console but it wasn’t responding either - the volume became so oppressively loud that I had to cover my ears.

Then I remembered there was a power switch for the speakers on the wall. I quickly ran toward it and flipped the switch. I almost wish I hadn’t.

The music immediately stopped but the screaming continued - this time inside the building. It was coming from right outside the main studio room. As soon as I exited the studio, the screams stopped.

To my left, I heard a door shut very loudly - It was the basement door.

I stared at it for a bit, placed my hand on the handle and slowly opened it.

I saw the stairs leading down into the basement. I started walking down slowly.

Looking back, I know I was acting incredibly carelessly. But in the moment, I was in a kind of trance.

Completely possessed by my need for answers. Reaching the basement floor, I looked around and tried to hear for any movement. There was a very specific kind of silence that felt like “less than nothing”.

The best way I can describe it is like a very faint “white noise” that was all around me. Like when you record silence on to tape and listen back at a very loud level - a kind of negative hiss.

I turned to the table where I had been working and saw the computer there. Something came over me. A cold sweat. I couldn’t move or breathe. I knew that something was there in the room and was trying to communicate with me, or manipulate me.

It felt as if the air was sucked out of the room when I remembered two things.

One, that when I first attempted to listen to the song on the computer, I could only hear white noise.

Two, that amongst all the equipment in the basement, I had found an old oscilloscope that was in working order.

I had received the message - a weight was lifted off of me and I could move again. I can’t describe where the urge came from to do what I did next. It felt as if the thought had been put in my mind by a demon.

I grabbed the oscilloscope from one of the rooms and connected it to the old computer’s headphone output. I turned it on and went to the only folder it contained. I then played the track in it, so that the noise would feed into the oscilloscope. Its screen started to show what normal white noise looks like, except in its distinctive green color. I wasn’t at all sure what I was looking for, but I started to turn the fine tune knobs on it to see what would happen. I think the white noise began to change because I noticed that an image began to take form. I leaned in closer to the screen to try to make sense of it. I kept on messing with the knobs until the image became as clear as possible. What I saw in that oscilloscope screen will haunt me for the rest of my days.

It was an image of my mother.

NoSleep,I'm seeing things I can't explain since my stay at Briar House,"I was forty thousand words into drafting my novel when it all turned to shit. I was trying to wrangle a cohesive draft from the sections spread out across notebooks, phone apps, half-written docs files, and scribbles on napkins, but I'd lost grip on what I found so exciting about the story and now it seemed thin and overwrought. My confidence had slipped just as much as my deadlines, and nothing I was doing to fix either was working. I was starting to dread sitting down at my laptop, feeling doubt and inertia gripping my fingers as I typed and deleted out sections that were too cliched, too obvious, simply not good enough.

One late night, scrolling distractedly through listings for secluded getaways, I found Briar House B&B, located in a sleepy retirement town about 3 hours away from the city. The photos showed a tall, wood-clad property with flower boxes at every window, surrounded by a wide, open lawn that bordered on evergreen forest. The listing boasted chef-prepared breakfasts, quiet rooms filled with antique furniture, and ""a garden with whimsical touches"" bordering on nothing but rolling hills and forest in the distance. The price was reasonable, and I figured if I stayed a couple of weeks, I might finally finish the book. And if I didn't . . . well, at least I'd have a quiet place to recharge completely and return to my draft with fresh eyes.

I drove away from home feeling excited for the first time in weeks, feeling the old tension being replaced with the energy of new potential coiled up inside my body. The roads became quieter and narrower as the city rolled away behind me, and as the pink light of dusk started to fall, I pulled into the gravel driveway of Briar House.

The first thing I noticed wasn't the floral-curtained house or the manicured lawns sprawling into the distance, but the hundreds of model houses. A village of scale replicas each a foot or so tall, with chalets, log cabins, and farmyard barns clustered around the bases of the trees, complete with tiny balconies and decks. Each one was meticulously painted and varnished in cheery colors with leafy plants, small rocks and mosses tucked in around them. Dribbling streams ran down piled rockeries where houses sat clustered on every simulated peak and valley, with orange lights shining from their tiny windows. There were even bird houses nailed to trees with vaulted roofs and tiny windows.

And then . . . I noticed the garden gnomes. Jolly-looking figures with rosy cheeks and pointed hats arranged all around the garden, nestled in ferns and posed under tree branches. Every type of gnome you could imagine were all there, from regular bearded gnomes, to younger ones with painted twinkles in their eyes, to gnomes dressed as chefs or doctors or farmers. Most of them looked happy and innocent, while others had a mischievous gleam in their eyes.

It was a kitsch paradise—charming, but also faintly unsettling. This was whimsical on a whole other level. Undoubtedly, this fairy kingdom was the labour of a lifetime, and I wondered what sort of person had created all of this—what sort of person would find this endearing and not remotely sinister.

I parked my car, feeling like I was being watched by hundreds of tiny eyes. I took a deep breath, put on my best polite smile, and walked toward the front door.

Before I reached the door, it opened and an older couple emerged, wide smiles creasing their kindly faces.

“Welcome to Briar House, dear!” the woman called, waving as she walked toward me. She was short and wiry, with grey curled hair and a floral apron tied around her waist. “You must be Jade! I’m Evelyn Hampton, and this is my husband, Robert.” She clasped my hand warmly with both hands as the man, tall and lean with thinning hair, nodded in greeting.

“We’re very pleased to have you,” he added. His voice was soft and slow, spoken as if he was savoring each word. “We don’t often have guests stay as long as two weeks. You’ll feel right at home, I’m sure.”

I smiled at him, imagining him painting each house with a look of intense concentration. “Thank you. The place is beautiful,” I replied, glancing around, though my gaze kept drifting back to the gnomes. Mrs Hampton caught my look and laughed quietly.

“I see you're admiring our little village!” she said with sparkling eyes. “It has a way of catching people’s attention. The gnomes keep an eye on things around here, don’t they, Robert?”

Robert nodded, his lips curling into a smile. “Yes, they do. They’re part of what makes Briar House so special.”

I tried not to make my laugh in response sound nervous, and followed them inside.

The inside of the house was much more kitsch than the photos had shown—lace tablecloths, floral prints, and everything delicately framed in faded pastels. My room was very quaint, with rose-print wallpaper and a crochet-blanketed bed that looked like it belonged in a story book. In one corner was an old-fashioned baby pram, and inside were two old-fashioned dolls staring up at me. The dolls had been arranged just so, in eyelet lace dresses with their china faces frozen in serene, eerie little smiles.

As they served up casserole and freshly baked bread, the Hamptons told me how Briar House had been their ""special home"" for 26 years now, and how the land had always been a place where “guests feel like they belong.” Robert proudly detailed all the work that had gone into creating the model village outside, and wryly complained about all the ongoing maintenance it needed. Evelyn talked about her love of hosting guests from all corners of the world, and happily took my order for breakfast the next day.

There was something a little unusual about the way they spoke, with pronounced pauses and each word spoken almost carefully, as if each phrase was being picked quite deliberately. Still, they came across as warm, if a little formal. Mrs Hampton wore a tiny gold crucifix, and they certainly seemed like straight-laced religious types—I couldn't imagine either of them angry, or cursing.

The dinner was delicious, and I fell asleep almost straight away when I collapsed on the bed upstairs.

The next morning, I woke up with a dull ache in my head and a heaviness in my limbs. I hoped it was just fatigue from travelling. I really didn't want to be getting sick—I had a nasty habit of falling ill as soon as I went on holiday, as if the moment my body slowed down, my defences also lowered. I dragged myself out of bed and headed downstairs for breakfast, where Mrs. Hampton was waiting. The table was laid meticulously with several sets of silver cutlery, gold-edged side plates, and a vase of fresh dahlias.

“Good morning, dear! How are you this morning?” she asked, patting my arm as she handed me a plate piled high with eggs, toast, and sausages. When I told her I had a bit of a headache, she almost instantly produced painkillers with a big glass of orange juice. “Eat up, every bite. A good breakfast is the best medicine.”

She was an attentive host, and insisted on changing the sheets on my bed every morning. I'd taken to leaving a cross-stitched cushion on top of the pram in my room each night to avoid feeling creeped out by the dolls' staring eyes, so I was careful to remove the cushion each morning and put it back in its place, to avoid offending Mrs Hampton.

That morning I sat down with my laptop in the garden, trying to ignore the heaviness in my limbs as I took in my surroundings. I’d come here to write, and the change of scenery was definitely an improvement on how boxed-in I was feeling within the walls of my city apartment. This place was beautiful—peculiar, but beautiful. The garden was full of blooming flowers, the leaves of the forest rustled in the breeze like the sound of distant waves, and light danced through the foliage. As I forced myself to write, the words finally seemed to be coming more easily.

By the third morning, though, an uncomfortable truth had become apparent: the gnomes were moving.

When I started noticing it I had tried to brush it off, telling myself that maybe I just hadn’t noticed where they were before. But this time was different. When I’d gone to bed, each gnome had been neatly arranged in clusters under the bushes and along the flower beds. But as I opened my curtains at dawn, I froze—the gnomes were lined up in a perfect row along the path in front of my room, and even though I was high above them it looked like they were looking towards my window, their tiny painted eyes staring up at me.

At first I thought it had to be some kind of prank, but I definitely couldn't imagine the Hamptons doing anything like that. I tried and failed to rationalize what I was seeing, so much so that I started doubting my own eyes, and I decided to go down to look closer. I crept down the stairs and out the front door, down to the path where they stood, arranged perfectly parallel with my bedroom window. I barely had time to process the scene when I heard a noise from the house behind me.

Mr Hampton was up early, standing on the porch in his usual starched shirt as he surveyed the yard. I quickly hid behind a tree, watching as he walked to collect each gnome, one by one, carefully placing them back into their original positions under bushes and along flower beds.

“They like things just so,” Mrs Hampton had said to me the day before. “They have a way of arranging themselves, don’t they, dear?”

In the days that followed I watched Mr Hampton rearrange the gnomes. If I woke early enough, I’d find them in some strange new arrangement—standing in lines, or gathered in solemn little circles. And each morning, Mr Hampton would rise at dawn to put them all back.

I still didn't know what I was seeing, or how I should be feeling. Should I be curious, or amused? Was this behaviour the work of a strange old man with nothing better to do, or was something more sinister occurring? I had no evidence that anything was wrong as such, but there was a growing feeling in my chest that I couldn't ignore—a tense, twisting anxiety. It was as though the gnomes were sending a silent message to me, but I couldn't understand what they were trying to say. I spent more and more time thinking about it, making it harder to even think about writing.

One morning, I woke and instinctively reached up to touch the necklace I always wore—a small silver locket that had belonged to my mother—only to find it missing. Panic rose over me like a wave. I tore through my bags, lifted up couch cushions, checked under the bed. But it was gone.

When I mentioned it to Mrs Hampton, she didn't seem too concerned. “Oh, we’ll keep an eye out for it,” she said, her tone as pleasant as ever, though it felt like her gaze lingered on me a moment too long. “Things have a way of turning up around here.”

The day went on, but there was a thick knot of disappointment inside me . . . disappointment that I had been so careless to lose one of the only mementos I had of her. My neck felt naked without the comforting weight of it. Its loss left me feeling unmoored, like a boat drifting away from the shores of my own life.

On the fifth morning I woke with a hacking cough, covered with clammy sweat, and my bed was cold and damp. My forehead burned and my throat felt raw and dry. I came downstairs to find Mr Hampton in the kitchen, serving breakfast. I greeted him weakly and explained I wasn't feeling any better as he studied me with his dark eyes. He excused himself to attend to the grounds while I sat limp and shovelled the food into my mouth, hoping that the food would make me feel more human.

When Mrs Hampton entered the kitchen, I could see there was something different in the way she held herself. Her face seemed tight, her smile a thin line. “Good morning,” I ventured, trying to break the silence, and there was a coolness in her voice as she greeted me in return.

I finished my breakfast quickly, made my excuses, and returned to my room. My bed was made—and I noticed that the dolls were now fully sat up in the pram, staring blankly at me. I realized with horror that I'd forgotten to remove the cushion before I came down for breakfast. I felt embarrassment bloom inside of me as I sat uncomfortably with the idea that I'd offended my hosts.

That night, the fever struck hard. My head screamed with pressure, my vision dancing and blurring. The air inside my room seemed unbearably thick with pot-pourri and scented candles. Desperate for fresh air, I stumbled outside, my legs feeling spindly and delicate as I stepped onto the damp lawn. The night was completely still and the grounds lay in wait, my rasping breaths the only sound.

II didn’t see the gnome until it was too late. My foot collided with it, sending it toppling over, and the thick crack of shattering plaster echoed through the quiet garden.

As I crouched down to inspect the damage, I saw something shining among the shards. I picked it up—a gold ring, tarnished with age. I stared at it dumbly, not quite sure what I was seeing. Had this come from inside the gnome? Or had it just been on the floor when I kicked the gnome over? The whole situation seemed unreal in the haze of my sickness, but I wasn't about to leave the mess for the Hamptons to discover with distaste in the morning. I picked up the plaster pieces carefully, and as I lifted up the gnome's shattered base, I noticed initials engraved into the bottom: E.R.

A thought came over me. Kneeling on the grass, I inspected the other gnomes nearby. Sure enough, every single one had initials painted on or carved into the base—C.W., M.G., L.H. Did each of these gnomes have a name? I struggled to process what I was seeing or what it meant. I staggered back to my room, not looking forward to telling the Hamptons about my accident, my mind swirling with confusion.

The next day, despite my sickness, a determination took hold of me. I was nearly a week into my stay, and still I had not explored the woods at the back of the property that had seemed so beckoning and lovely when I had booked. Maybe they would hold more secrets? Even though the sun hadn't quite risen yet I forced myself out of bed, slipped on my shoes, and ventured towards the forest.

Gnomes were lined up, as if trying to block my way, as I approached the ramshackle gate at the neck of the woods. I stepped over them as I unlatched it and walked through.

The forest was deliciously untouched and natural, with brambles cascading over undergrowth and the ground carpeted in pine needles and leaf litter. It smelt like green wildness, thick with fertile damp. It felt like a welcome relief from Briar House, where everything was meticulously manicured and arranged.

The woods got closer and wilder as I walked further in. In the distance I spied a small outbuilding, half-obscured by a tight tangle of trees. I stepped over logs and ducked under branches as I wound a path towards it.

The building was ramshackle, smelling like wet wood and covered in mildew. For a moment I almost turned away until I noticed the thin wooden crucifixes dangling from the eaves, moving slowly in the breeze. I could feel my heart pumping quicker as I pushed open the door, the creak of its hinges filling the silence.

Inside, the dim light revealed shelves cluttered with strange trinkets—broken watches, torn scraps of clothing, even lockets and rings scattered among bits of bone and old, dried flowers. In the center of it all, my mother’s locket lay tangled in a patch of freshly-disturbed dust, shining faintly in the sickly light.

Fear sank my stomach like a stone as my eyes fell on the gnome sat next to it. With wavering hands I lifted it, turning it over to find J.M.—my initials—scratched into the base.

A wave of sickness washed over me. Maybe I wasn’t a visitor at Briar House—maybe I was an offering to it.

I grabbed the locket and stumbled back towards the house, trying to still my heart and make myself look as inconspicuous as possible. I didn't know what this all meant, but I knew that something was very wrong, and I needed to get out of here before something awful happened. I slipped inside and snuck up to my room.

As I stuffed my clothes into my bags, something caught my eye. A guestbook lay on a squat, mahogany table in the corner of the room. Flipping through its pages, I scanned each entry, noting the names and comparing them in my mind with the initials I’d seen on the gnomes. I remembered seeing a C.W., an M.G., an E.R., and it didn't take me long to find a match for C.W—Clara Wainwright.

I grabbed the guestbook and flipped open my laptop. I likely wouldn't be able to find any information about these people based on their names alone, but Clara's entry also had a location: ""Briar House is a beautiful, restful place. Coming all the way from busy Portland, I’ve never felt so peaceful as I did here. The Hamptons are warm and thoughtful hosts, and the garden is like a fairy tale. I’ll carry the memory of this place with me forever, and I hope to return someday. Sincerely, Clara Wainwright.""

I tapped ""Clara Wainwright Portland Oregon"" into Google. Shudders ran down my spine as I read:

""Portland, Oregon—Clara Wainwright, 34, a lifelong resident of Portland, passed away on September 5th after a brief but serious illness. Known for her vibrant personality and love of travel, Clara was a graphic designer and avid gardener who was deeply loved by her friends and family.

Clara fell ill shortly after returning from a solo retreat in rural British Columbia. Despite receiving care at a Portland hospital, her health declined rapidly, and she slipped into a coma in late August, passing away soon after. Doctors were unable to determine the exact nature of her illness . . .""

Before I could read any further, I heard footsteps behind me. I spun around to see Mr and Mrs Hampton standing in the doorway. Their faces tightened as they saw the open guestbook and the obituary article on my screen—their mouths curled as if snarling, anger darkening their features.

“What are you doing, Jade?” Mrs Hampton asked, her voice icy and sharp.

I didn’t answer, but I couldn't just sit here. I didn't really know what my game plan was as I leapt off the bed, grabbed one of the dolls from the pram, and hurled it to the floor. Almost in slow motion I watched the doll's china head shatter, pieces scattering across the wood.

Among the shards, something plastic lay there—a baby's dummy, yellowed with age.

The Hamptons faces lit up with rage. As Mr Hampton lurched towards me, I ducked. I slipped past Mrs Hampton, adrenaline coursing through me as I bolted down the stairs. She cried out with shock and surprise, and Mr Hampton roared like an angry beast as they gave chase. I didn't look back—didn't wait to see how close they were as I fumbled with the keys, finally turning the ignition and tearing down the gravel path, the Hamptons’ figures growing smaller in my rear view mirror.

I'm writing out this story now to try to exorcise it from my brain. I can't stop thinking about the memory of those gnomes, their rosy faces hiding awful secrets. I haven't finished the book I've been trying to write—that story feels so thin and insignificant now.

Despite my better judgment, I looked up Briar House online one more time. The listing was the same as before: charming, pristine photos of the Victorian house, the gardens brimming with gnomes and fairy houses. I scrolled down to the reviews, glancing through the familiar praises for the “quaint” decorations and “quiet, friendly hosts.” But one recent review caught my eye.

“The little gnomes are adorable,” it read, alongside a photo of the garden I knew too well. “My favorite part? I found one tucked under a bush with my initials carved into the base! Such a funny coincidence—I felt like I truly belonged.”

A week has passed since I left Briar House, but I don't feel like I escaped. I'm still so sick, and every time I muster up the energy to leave my house, I see gnomes everywhere now—in shop windows, tucked under bushes in the park. Each one has that same unnerving grin, as if it knows me, as if it's amused at my fear.

This morning I found a wooden crucifix on my nightstand. Briar House is following me, an unwelcome stranger reaching into my life. I'm terrified that it won't let me go until it's claimed me.",44,0.97,10,niceynice876,2024-11-05 11:30:07,1gkc6pu,54,High
NoSleep,I used to cook for a Hollywood celebrity who made me face away from him whilst he ate.,"“You must remain in the room whilst I dine,” he told me three years ago. “But face the wall, and *do not* turn around until I've eaten every last crumb.”

I nodded. “How will—”

“I will *tell* you when I’ve finished,” he brashly interrupted, having anticipated my question.

And when I made the mistake of breaking his one rule, I saw something terrifying.

I hate to disappoint you, but I won’t endanger myself by naming this world-famous figure. I’ve been lying low since February, praying to never cross his path again. I moved from Los Angeles to Toronto. Put more than two-thousand miles of deserts, mountains, and woodland between that man and me. Yet, I still feel watching eyes upon me. Every single day. I fear that he hopes to silence me before I spill his secret.

That’s why I won’t tell you to run from LA. Nowhere is safe from him. Instead, I’m hoping that putting this story out there will give him no reason to silence me. You’re all about to learn the truth, so he’ll have to tread carefully in the future. Right? I know I’ve not named him, but I’ve put a spotlight on the horrors of the Hills.

This is a Hollywood icon, and I cooked his lunches and dinners every day from November of 2021 to February of 2024. But one particular lunchtime, an act of recklessness brought my employment to end.

A flatbread topped with charred spring onions, chilli flakes, and feta. That was the dish. A modest lunch for a self-proclaimed modest man. Perfectly ordinary food. I didn’t serve the heart of a stillborn babe. Not the ribs of some famous rival. Just a light, nutritious dish to bridge breakfast and dinner.

That day was the same as any other, so I don’t know why I did it. Looked, I mean. I’d spent three years cooking for my client, and I’d never previously questioned his only rule. I hadn’t dreamt of disobeying him, as he paid such a disgustingly inflated salary. Not until one ordinary day in late February.

I placed the flatbread on the table, walked over to the kitchen counter, then focused my gaze on the wall ahead. Twiddled my thumbs and waited patiently whilst he tucked noisily into his meal.

That was something I’d always noticed. The *sound*. The slaps and smacks of his lips, tongue, and teeth meeting various food textures. I don’t have misophonia, but that man managed to produce noises which utterly perturbed me.

I don’t care about those who talk whilst they eat. Don’t even care about those who eat with their mouths open. No, the racket of this man’s feasting disturbed me because it always sounded like *more* than one person eating.

There were even the distant sounds of what I’d convinced myself were tiny voices, as if the man had spent four years sneaking friends into the kitchen behind my back. As if they were speaking amongst themselves in hushed tones. Muttering odd phrases. Not food reviews, but comments on culture. Comments on countries and histories.

“This tells us… In the mountains of Malaysia… Four-hundred years ago…”

The snippets of insights were always too quiet to fully distinguish. Of course, it was the wet sloshing and smacking that stole most of my attention.

I tried to make meals that were softer, in the hope that this would lead to quieter munching. I served yoghurt, risotto, and so on. No matter what I attempted, the sounds never lessened. And I knew that this was no mean-spirited joke. He wasn’t sharing a meal with hidden guests. Though I certainly wouldn’t have been the first woman to find myself at the receiving end of his bizarre antics.

Believe me. Over the years, I’d considered numerous scenarios in my head, but none of them felt right. None of them warmed my chilled flesh whilst that awful man ate, so I eventually broke. Something came over me. Madness, I suppose, born of years working in a draining environment. All for a healthy heap of bucks.

Well, I’d passed my threshold. The money no longer mattered. I had to know.

I turned away from the wall.

The man at the kitchen table was not eating. Not in any human sense of the word. The sides of his face had opened like the skin of a tangerine, revealing neither hidden tissue nor bone beneath. There was a crater within his skull. A crater into which he was shovelling torn strips of my lovingly-cooked flatbread. The meal was not disappearing into a mouth. There *was* no mouth below the celebrity’s unzipped face.

Chunks of bread and toppings were washing over a dozen rolling eyeballs — each with a black sclera, a white iris, and a red pupil. Inhuman eyes. Eyes that were not consuming the food, but letting the broken fragments slide off their rolling surfaces, as if absorbing the meal’s secrets. Learning something from it. And the flatbread did not disappear into the body below. It disintegrated in the black, watery film coating those many eyes.

I was too haunted to scream, but I’d already been detected.

The celebrity stopped. His hand hovered, and those many eyes, coated in the dissolving crumbs of my meal, swivelled to face me.

Then the man started to tremble violently, crushing the remaining handful of flatbread in the pit of his palm. I allowed my mouth to release a meek whimper as flecks of bread clattered against the china plate below. My eyes had already flitted towards the kitchen entrance and the lobby beyond it. The front door was in sight, and my weak legs carried me towards it.

But the man did not need to stand to pursue me. He punched his arm forwards, and a long, reptilian tentacle tore through his open palm. Escaped from its prison of human skin, then shot across the kitchen towards me.

I was already crossing the lobby as the lunging limb hissed at me from its black scales. I felt the alien arm’s stale breath against my back, cutting through my T-shirt, as that man sought my flesh. Not to eat, but to wash over his many eyeballs. He wanted to soak me up. Study me. And as I thought of all of the womanising he’d done over the years, the many flings who’d come and ‘gone’, I wondered whether any of them had met that fate.

I fumbled with the latch for an eternal second, flung the door open, and triumphantly made it to the porch. But the fine prick of a sharp limb caught my spine as I stumbled onto the driveway — instantly stained my shirt with a staggeringly-large pool of blood.

Yelping in agony, I pushed onwards. Pushed across the driveway, scaled the fence, and ran through the streets of Beverly Hills.

I remember little of what followed. Barely remember how I ended up in Toronto, in all honesty. I know that I abandoned everything. My home, my friends, my family, and my life.

In spite of that, this nightmare isn’t over. For months, I have felt something *watching* me. I’m convinced. Just as I’m convinced that this celebrity eats more than ‘people food’.

“I will handle my own breakfasts,” the star firmly told me back in 2021.

I replied, “Are you sure? I make a mean—”

“*You would not want to cater to my morning needs*,” he half-growled.

At the end of the day, this is about more than getting the truth out there. More than, hopefully, protecting myself from him. This is a cautionary tale.

NoSleep,"My neighbors have milk cartons full of blood in their basement, and I think my husband knows why","It all started when I woke up in the middle of the night and found a strange, suffocating weight on my chest, like someone was sitting on me. I could make out an outline of someone’s figure above me, their back outlined by the orange light from the street lamps seeping through the window.

I tried to scream for help, or turn my head to look at my husband, but I couldn’t move. I didn’t regain control of my body until after the weight had lifted, and I heard a deep, male grunt, from a man pulling himself off me. I heard his footsteps too. I saw his silhouette leave through the door. 

And it was only hours later of laying in that same position that I felt I could move again. It started with a pinpricking sensation through my toes and fingers, then spread through my entire body – like the feeling you get when your leg falls asleep and you have to wake it back up. 

I immediately went to my husband and shook him awake. He was distraught and confused, asking me to slow down, to tell him what happened. He was so scared by my hysterics he was moved to tears. Even still, he didn’t believe me. He said he was right next to me, he’d have woken up if someone came inside our room. He assured me it was all a dream and rubbed my back to soothe me until I could fall back asleep. 

But a week later, the same paralysis came for me. It was after an argument with my husband over finances. The same terror, the same feeling of someone sitting on my chest, then getting up and leaving the room. This time, I saw something in their hand. A knife? I couldn’t know. It was far too dark. My husband again told me it was just a bad dream, that I couldn’t afford to keep stressing myself out so much over money. 

 Ever since I lost my job, we’ve been struggling to make rent. My husband keeps telling me he’ll take care of it, he’ll take care of us. I think that's some weird masculine bullshit from his time - (he's 43, I'm 26). 

 That’s the other problem with all this: I’m pregnant. Five months around this time. The financial strain had been weighing on my psyche and causing me so much stress that I’d resorted to my own means of making money for us (since I couldn’t seem to find another real job). 

 I’d been participating in paid clinical trials in order to make ends meet for us. My husband never asked where the extra money was coming from, he had no idea. He’s always been so protective over me, he would’ve died knowing I was “selling my body” to “big pharma.” It was a clinical drug trial for preeclampsia, and all they did was give me a small pill, take my blood and my vitals, and send me on my way once a week. 

 Maybe the pills were causing these sleep paralysis episodes. I wasn’t sure. But I could never confide in my husband about it. 

 Anyway, a week ago I went over to my neighbor’s house with my husband for a little Halloween party. My neighbors Sara (40f) and Tom (40m) are both so, so sweet. They left baked goods on our porch every Saturday since I announced my pregnancy. Sara checked in on me almost daily, texting me asking me how I am, how I’m feeling, if I’m having any morning sickness. 

Their kindness makes this whole thing all the stranger. 

At the Halloween party, I asked Sara for a soda. Everyone else was having beer, but, you know. She told me they have some in her outside fridge – down the stairs in the unfinished basement / garage. So I headed away from the party, fumbled for the string light and made my way down the creaky wooden steps to the basement. The floor was concrete and cold on my bare feet, so I tiptoed past Tom’s latest mechanical mess to the kitchenette and old, rusted white fridge in the far corner.  

The first thing I noticed here was a red splatter of what looked to be blood on the inside of the washbasin. There were power tools and saws and such down here, as the basement is also Tom’s workshop. He could’ve cut his finger, washed his hands and not the sink?

I shrugged it off and opened the fridge. I was immediately hit with a strange whiff of iron as I swung the door open. There were at least a three dozen milk cartons coating the shelves inside, with two Sprites in the fridge door. 

I don’t know what compelled me then to reach for the milk. Maybe I was really thirsty for it. Some pregnancy craving. Maybe I knew something was wrong, I had some intuition about it. But I grabbed a carton. It was heavy, and the liquid inside didn’t slosh the way I expected it to. It sounds strange, like something you wouldn’t be able to notice, but I did. I placed it down on the single countertop of the kitchenette, found a glass in the top shelf of the cabinet above, unscrewed the cap of the milk carton and began to pour. What came out wasn’t milk. It was red. 

It was blood. 

I vomited in the sink. Tom must have heard me, or knew I was digging where I shouldn’t have been. He came down and held back my hair while I emptied my stomach, whispering calm words like easing a brood mare. He called down my husband, who took me back upstairs. He threw my coat over my shoulders and talked quietly with Tom and Sara by the door. *She’ll be fine. Just scared is all. No worries. Thank you, yes.* 

I stood there with nothing to say, eyes wide, unsure of what to make of it all. My first ridiculous thought was that Tom and Sara were vampires. It wasn’t till we were walking back across the street to our house that I was able to ask Tom, “What was that?” Tom looked at me strangely, his brow furrowed. 

“Why were you poking around where you shouldn’t be?” 

 “Are you serious? They had blood in their milk cartons!” Tom sighed, pulled away from me. He was obviously frustrated.

  
“They own a farm, Liv.” 

“Okay?”  

“You don’t know how slaughtering an animal works, do you?” He was so so angry, I could see his hands bunched into fists, shaking slightly. 

“What are you talking about?” 

“They drain the pigs of blood after slaughter.” I chewed on this, shaking my head, both of us standing at odds with each other in the middle of the road. 

“So? Are you trying to tell me they’ve filled milk cartons with pig’s blood?” 

“Yes.” 

“Why the hell would they do that?”  

“Because it’s a thickening agent, high in protein. It’s used in a wide variety of dishes. You’ve probably eaten it before and haven’t even known it.” I stared at my husband indignantly, feeling shame rising up in me. The last thing I wanted to do was apologize. But here I was, saying sorry in the middle of the street, just to get us back inside the house.  

My sleep paralysis stopped for a few months after. At my seventh month of pregnancy, it started again. Once a week, usually Sunday nights. I would take my prenatal vitamins before bed, and wake up around midnight to find it almost impossible to breathe. At this point, I was no longer sleeping on my back. I was sleeping on my side. Still, the sleep paralysis demon, or, “man,” would straddle my shoulders, his back rising above me like a mountain so I couldn’t see anything but the bottom of his feet. Bare. Black soles. Long toenails that scrapped against the sheets. Dirtied jeans. 

Sure enough, it should’ve been a dream. But one night I woke, crying once again, and after I settled, I found dirt rubbed off on the white pillowcase by my head. A deep red stain on the bed. That same morning in the shower, I checked myself for any hints of damage. When I was paralyzed like that, I couldn’t feel a damn thing except the relentless weight on top of me, the inability to fully breathe. 

The only injuries on me were the bruises on the inside of my elbows on both sides, right where I had weekly blood draws at the clinical trial. The clinical trial my husband still didn’t know about. Though he should’ve seen the discoloration on my arms when we had sex, which now, was more and more frequent. 

Leading up to my birth, my husband’s behavior toward me became even stranger. He worried incessantly over me, taking me to sleep trials which revealed no abnormalities, arguing with doctors that something was wrong. Describing my dizziness, my fatigue, the bruising on my arms (the first time I realized he’d noticed). The doctors said this was all normal for someone during pregnancy, especially nearing the end.

I remember at the end of my seventh month of pregnancy, I again had a bout of sleep paralysis. 

This time, during it, I swear I could hear my husband crying softly. It was hard to make out over the grunts and heavy breathing above me. I asked him over breakfast what he’d been crying about. He was very, very quiet, and told me only that he had a bad dream that I was being hurt.  

Maybe, at the time, I thought my paranoia a problem. Either way I obeyed it. I no longer trusted my husband. Nor did I trust my neighbors, even my own parents. I stopped eating any food anyone made for me, and cooked only for myself. I lost weight, became even paler and weaker than before. I stopped attending the clinical trials, and my husband came home with more money, having recently gotten a promotion I didn’t believe, as he clocked out of work hours early every day to come check up on me. 

Except, strangest of all, my sleep paralysis stopped completely. Instead I slept dreamless, and it was nearly impossible to wake me. I slept for twelve, thirteen hours at a time without waking up once.

One morning, in the shower, weeks after I’d stopped attending the clinical trials and getting regular blood draws, I found strange bruising over my inner elbow, a small pinprick over the vein. In the dark I hadn’t been able to see the lack or presence of bruising. But under the bathroom lights it was there. 

I confronted my husband about it. He said I probably injured myself somehow. I should go get checked out, I shouldn’t be bruising so easily. I told him that it looked like a needle wound, traced the vein’s blueness. He looked at me so, so strangely, then his phone rang, and he disappeared into the bedroom.

My suspicions had grown intense. Something was wrong. No more sleep paralysis, sure, but someone was visiting me in the night still. I knew it. 

A few weeks before my due date, I didn’t take my prenatal vitamins. It was a Monday. It was midnight, and I was pretending to sleep. I didn’t feel the usual unrelenting fatigue I did late in the evening. But still, awake, I saw him come in. I closed my eyes quick, heard his heavy breathing over me. Then he pulled the bedsheet over my face, whispered in a rough voice, “Alright girl.” 

I recognized that voice. 

He reached under the blankets, his hand brushing mine above the mattress. I made a small noise of fear, flinched away. He froze. Then he put a hand on my shoulder, moved the bedsheet away from my face and even though my eyes were closed, I could feel him studying me. Watching me. 

  
Once I calmed myself he continued, taking my wrist in his hand and holding the inside with his two fingers. He was wearing gloves. Nitrile. And he was taking my pulse, I realized. Counting to a minute. The longest minute of my fucking life. Then he placed a hand on my belly, and it took everything in me not to scream. Something cold replaced his fingers, and he held it there. My stomach churned, and my baby reared up inside me. I was going to throw up. No, I couldn’t. 

“That’s it,” he whispered to me, to no one. I realized then how I recognized the voice. 

Tom. It sounded just like Tom.

That was all I could take. I jolted out of my sleep and upright, my eyes meeting his in the dark. Sure enough, Tom was staring back at me. 

I screamed at him and he raised his gloved hands. There was a stethoscope around his neck, like he was cosplaying a fucking doctor. My husband shot up from the other side of the bed. For a moment him and Tom just stared at each other. Then my husband raised his voice in a way I’d never heard before.  

“Get out! Get out!” Tom shot out of the room quicker than I could process. My husband chased him out, his shouts and threats echoing through the house. When he came back I told him we should call the cops. He said no, that wasn’t a good idea. He would deal with it. He took a bat from underneath the bed and headed out with it. I tried to stop him, but he left out the front door and didn’t return till the next morning. 

By then, I’d found the milk carton laying on its side by my fallen bedsheets. A plastic funnel on the ground next to it. I felt sick. So fucking sick to think about all that blood in Tom’s fridge. *My blood.* 

I went to the bathroom and emptied my stomach till I couldn’t anymore. When my husband came home, he told me he’d “taken care of it.” There was blood splattered on his face and the bat. He washed it off in the kitchen sink. I was silent. At a loss for words. 

 Afterward, I watched him put locks on all the doors, draw the shades and set the alarms. 

“Did you kill him?” I asked. My husband just shook his head no. 

As he locked our bedroom window he said, “Just to be safe, okay?” For the rest of the day we cooped ourselves up inside, watching movies, “taking it easy” as he put it. Laying low. I asked him what the hell Tom would want with cartons of blood. My husband looked wildly uncomfortable, said that men are scary, it could’ve been anything. 

  
“Could’ve been selling it on the dark web, that shit makes a lot of money, supposedly.” He kissed my forehead and pulled me close. I asked him for the second time then if we should call the police. He didn’t reply. 

Over the next week he told me I needed to stay home, that he’d go out for groceries, meds, etc. Almost my entire pregnancy he’d been pushing for a home birth, but now he was adamant about it. Meanwhile, I was having second thoughts. What if something went wrong? What if Tom came by? Whenever I shared these concerns with my husband he got angry. 

Eventually, after a heated argument I asked him if he planned to keep me cooped up like a dog till I gave birth or died. He just glared at me. I said I was going to leave for a little while, give him some time to work through things. 

As soon as I did, he grabbed me by the arm and begged me to stay. He burst into tears, saying that everything he did, he did for me. That he was sorry for how he’d been treating me, how he’d scared me, but he was scared, god he was scared. 

He asked me to stay with him. 

So I did. 

When he went to take a shower that night, I again checked our bedroom for anything Tom might’ve left behind. I don’t know what I was expecting to find. Nothing on the floor, of course. It’d been a week after all, I would’ve tripped over anything left over. But under the bed…

Under the bed was a spool of rope. 

Cable ties. 

 Duct tape. 

 My husband and I had never participated in bondage or anything of the sort. 

 That was my final straw. I had a horrible, horrible feeling. I called my mom and asked her if I could come over. She said of course. 

 I tried to go out the front door, but it was locked from the outside. I didn’t even know that was possible. I tried the back door. Locked again. At this point I was so panicked I started to cry. I checked the kitchen window. 

 Locked.

 Finally, the giant office window was open. Eight months pregnant, I hauled my ass out the window and dropped five feet into the garden. And I ran. Caught an uber and made my way to my mom’s place. 

 I’ve been here two days now. I have endless missed calls from my husband. I don’t know what the hell to say to him. I’m not sure if I think he’s just paranoid, or if he’s somehow a part of this whole thing with Tom.

 

What the fuck should I do? Should I go back home? I don’t want to give birth without my husband, but he’s scaring me. Tom is a whole other problem I’m too afraid to fully confront. I’m thinking of going back home tomorrow and explaining myself to my husband, getting answers to the questions that have been plaguing me, and leaving if I need to.

 I don’t want to do anything too drastic, like call off the marriage before I know the whole story…but I guess I’m afraid to know what the hell the real story is.



What do you think? Should I try and fix things before I give birth? Should I call the police?

NoSleep,My friend and I went camping at Red River Gorge. Something was following us...,"My friend Alex and I went camping at Red River Gorge last year. He never came back. The police say I made up what happened, a twisted way of coping with losing him. They think it was an accident, or maybe that I’m hiding some horrible truth. But I know what I saw out there. I know there’s something in those woods—a creature, a monster. It’s out there, hiding in the shadows, watching, waiting.

I can still hear the crunch of leaves and the way the night seemed to breathe around us. It started as a perfect autumn hike, the forest glowing red and gold in the setting sun. But when darkness fell, we weren’t alone. We thought it was just nerves or our imaginations running wild in the quiet, but that was before the thing in the woods started stalking us.

It was just past midnight when I heard it for the first time—a faint rustling, almost like footsteps, circling the edge of our campsite. I opened my eyes and looked over at Alex, who was lying stiff in his sleeping bag, staring wide-eyed at the trees. His breathing was shallow, barely a whisper above the crackling embers of our fire.

“Did you hear that?” he murmured, voice trembling. I nodded, my throat too tight to answer. We sat up slowly, peering into the darkness, trying to convince ourselves it was just a deer or a raccoon. But the sounds were too careful, too deliberate, as if whatever was out there knew exactly where we were.

Then, just as quickly as it started, the rustling stopped. Silence filled the air again, thick and oppressive. We waited, our ears straining, but there was nothing. Alex exhaled, his shoulders relaxing as he mumbled something about going back to sleep. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that whatever had been there was still watching, lurking just beyond the reach of our firelight.

By morning, the fear had faded, almost like a bad dream that didn’t quite stick. The golden sunlight trickled through the trees, painting the forest in a warm glow that made everything seem safe again. Alex and I exchanged uneasy smiles as we packed up our gear, shrugging off the strange sounds from the night before. Maybe we’d just psyched ourselves out; it was easy to let the dark play tricks on your mind.

We decided to take the Auxier Ridge Trail that morning. Known for its sweeping views and jagged cliff faces, the trail felt like the perfect way to ground ourselves, to let the beauty of the gorge erase the eerie feeling that lingered. We hiked along the narrow path, laughing off our shared paranoia, enjoying the crunch of leaves underfoot and the crisp autumn air.

As we reached a clearing, we stopped to take in the view. The gorge stretched out below, a stunning cascade of fiery reds and deep greens. For a moment, it felt like we’d escaped whatever darkness had brushed against us last night. But as we continued up the trail, a nagging feeling crept back in. The forest was too quiet—no birds, no wind, just the sound of our footsteps echoing through the trees.

As we rounded a bend, the trail dipped back into a dense stretch of woods, and the comforting sunlight faded under the thick canopy. Shadows stretched long across the ground, and a chill pricked my skin. I tried to shake the feeling creeping up my spine, but then I heard it—a faint stirring in the leaves, not too far off. I stopped, grabbing Alex’s arm.

“You hear that?” I whispered, my voice barely steady.

Alex paused, listening, then shrugged, giving me a reassuring smile. “Probably just a deer, or maybe a fox,” he said, squeezing my shoulder. “This place is full of wildlife. Don’t worry.”

I nodded, but something about the sound felt… wrong. As we moved on, I kept glancing over my shoulder, catching the barest hint of movement in the distance. The rustling started again, closer now, and it seemed to follow us, stopping whenever we did and picking up again when we walked.

Whatever was out there, it wasn’t just passing through. It was following us, and every step sent a fresh wave of dread down my spine.

After another hour of hiking, we came upon a shallow, natural cave—a perfect spot to set up camp for the night. The rock face overhead offered some shelter, and the area felt secluded. Alex set off to gather firewood while I unpacked our gear, arranging our things to make the space as comfortable as possible.

As I finished unrolling the sleeping bags, I heard leaves rustling somewhere in the distance. Assuming it was Alex on his way back, I went back to my work, but the footsteps sounded strange—light, almost fleeting, like something or someone was darting through the trees. Then, as suddenly as they’d started, the footsteps broke off, disappearing into the silence.

Moments later, Alex emerged from the opposite direction, carrying another bundle of wood. He was whistling, completely unfazed. My heart lurched. Whatever had been moving out there, it hadn’t been him.

“Hey, everything okay?” he asked, noticing my expression as he dropped the wood by the fire pit.

“Alex… I heard footsteps,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “Just now. I thought it was you, but… but it was coming from the other direction. And they ran off right before you got here.”

He raised an eyebrow, glancing over his shoulder into the darkening woods, then back at me with a reassuring smile. “Sarah, it’s probably just an animal. This place is full of them. You’re spooking yourself.”

I shook my head, my hands fidgeting as I tried to explain. “No, it was different, Alex. It sounded… like someone was following us. First on the trail, now here.” My voice cracked, and I could feel my pulse pounding.

Alex stepped closer, putting a hand on my shoulder. “Hey, look at me,” he said, his voice calm. “It’s just us out here, okay? I’ll keep the fire going tonight. Whatever you’re hearing, I promise you, it’s nothing that can’t be explained.”

But even as he said it, I could see a flicker of doubt in his eyes. And as the firelight danced across the mouth of the cave, the shadows seemed to stretch just a little too far.

After we finished our meager dinner, Alex tended to the fire, piling a few larger logs onto the embers to keep it burning through the night. The warmth and steady crackling sound, along with the clear, star-studded sky above us, calmed my nerves. Slowly, I drifted off, the tension of the day slipping away as sleep took over.

I don’t know how long I’d been asleep when I felt a hand shaking my shoulder. My eyes flew open, and there was Alex, wide-eyed, whispering urgently.

“I heard something,” he said, barely above a murmur. “It sounded like sticks breaking, just over there in the trees.” He pointed to the edge of the campsite, his voice tense but steady.

A chill swept over me, and immediately, my mind flashed back to the rustling footsteps I’d heard earlier. Every nerve in my body was on high alert as I sat up, scanning the dark edges of the trees. Alex had his flashlight, its beam cutting through the darkness, darting back and forth as he listened, peering into the shadows.

For a moment, it was silent except for the crackling of the fire. Then, just beyond the circle of light, I thought I caught the faintest rustling—barely there, like something moving through the underbrush but trying to stay hidden. My heart raced, my breath coming quick and shallow. Alex and I exchanged a glance, and in his eyes, I could see he was no longer dismissing it as just an animal.

Something was out there.

“Stay here. Keep the light steady,” Alex whispered, gripping one of the smoldering logs from the fire. He flicked his flashlight off, nodding toward the edge of the woods. “I’m gonna get close, see if I can catch it off guard.”

My heart pounded as I held my flashlight steady on the spot he’d pointed out, illuminating the edge of the trees. Alex slipped down the hill quietly, moving just at the edge of my light’s reach. I could barely make out his figure as he neared the trees, and then, in one quick movement, he stepped into the shadows.

Suddenly, there was a loud rustling, and whatever had been lurking there bolted deeper into the woods. Alex turned his flashlight back on, its beam bouncing wildly as he sprinted after it. My light caught a flicker of movement—just for a second—but it was enough. I saw a figure, barely visible, dressed in dark, earth-toned clothing, vanishing into the trees.

“Alex! Stop! Come back!” I screamed, my voice cracking. But he didn’t even turn. He kept chasing, his light flashing sporadically through the dense trees, growing fainter with each step.

I strained to listen, my breath held tight, but after a few moments, his footsteps faded into nothing, leaving me alone with only the sound of my own heartbeat echoing through the silence.

The wait felt like an eternity, each second stretching longer than the last. The forest was silent, the fire crackling softly beside me. Then, finally, I saw it—Alex’s flashlight, a steady beam cutting through the darkness, aimed directly at me. Relief washed over me at first, but it quickly faded when I realized he wasn’t saying anything. He just kept walking, the light fixed on me, growing closer.

“Alex?” I called, squinting, trying to make out his face beyond the blinding beam. But he didn’t respond. The light stayed on me, unwavering, unblinking, illuminating every inch of me while he stayed hidden in the shadows.

A strange unease settled over me, tightening in my chest. My heart pounded as I forced myself to ask, “Alex… are you okay?”

Nothing. Only the beam, sharp and unyielding, keeping me pinned in its glare. I shifted uncomfortably, nerves buzzing. Something felt horribly wrong, and my stomach twisted with a dread I couldn’t explain.

I squinted, trying to see past the light. But all I could see was that beam, focused solely on me.

“Alex, this isn’t funny!” I shouted, my voice wavering. I could feel tears stinging my eyes, a sense of dread clawing at my insides. The silence was suffocating, and the flashlight beam remained fixed on me, unyielding, as if studying me.

Then, just as my fear began to tip into panic, the light flicked off.

I blinked, my vision swimming in the sudden darkness as my eyes struggled to adjust. Shadows danced across the edge of the firelight, and the trees seemed to close in around me. My breath hitched, my chest tight with fear as my vision finally cleared.

And then I saw it.

The figure standing there, just barely visible in the fire’s dim glow, wasn’t Alex. The shape was wrong—too tall, too still. It loomed, silent and unblinking, watching me with an unnatural intensity. My blood went cold as I realized it wasn’t my friend who had come back.

My hands shook, and I stumbled back, every instinct screaming at me to run. But I couldn’t tear my eyes away from that dark figure, rooted in place by a terror so profound, it left me paralyzed.

I sat frozen, my mind racing but my body locked in place as the figure lingered just beyond the firelight, a silent, hulking shadow. Every part of me screamed to run, but the darkness surrounding us felt too vast, too full of unknown horrors. And the thought of what it might have done to Alex held me there, gripped in a kind of terror that swallowed me whole.

The creature then lowered itself, crouching down, its face finally catching the glow of the fire. My stomach twisted as I took in its features—it wasn’t a man. The face staring back at me was stretched and elongated, more animal than human, with a doglike snout covered in thick, dark brown fur. And those eyes—two sickly, yellow orbs reflecting the firelight with an unnatural glimmer.

Realization hit me like a cold slap. The brown I’d seen earlier wasn’t clothing. It was fur. This thing had never been human.

Horrified, I turned over, yanking my blanket up to my chin, curling in on myself as if it could somehow protect me. I lay there trembling, waiting for the inevitable—the lunge, the sharp pain of claws or teeth. But nothing happened. The creature just stayed there, crouched, watching me in silence.

Time seemed to stretch, every second feeling like an eternity as I shook under my blanket, my breath shallow, my mind on the edge of breaking. But still, it didn’t move. It just stayed there, keeping its vigil over me, as if it had all the time in the world.

I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to erase the creature’s face from my mind, but those eyes—the sickly, yellow glow, piercing and unblinking—were seared into my memory. It sat there for hours, crouched just at the edge of the firelight, watching me in a silence that felt like it was consuming me whole. Every second stretched and twisted, each heartbeat feeling like it could be my last. The terror was so intense, I thought it might kill me right there in the darkness.

I lay there, shaking, clutching the blanket as if it could protect me, my mind spiraling in endless fear. But the creature never moved. It just stayed there, its eyes drilling into me, studying me with a patience that was somehow worse than anything it could have done.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, I heard it shift. My heart hammered as I listened to it stand, its massive form looming in the dim glow of the fire. For one awful moment, I thought it was coming toward me. But then, slowly, it turned, and I heard its heavy footsteps fading away, each one feeling like a small mercy.

Only when the forest returned to silence did I dare open my eyes, my heart still racing as I stared into the empty woods, too afraid to move, too numb to comprehend that I’d survived the night.

I stayed curled up, clutching the blanket, listening to every small sound, every crackle of the dying fire. It felt like hours before I finally worked up the courage to turn around, to face the space where the creature had crouched, watching me. I slowly lifted my head and looked over my shoulder.

It was gone.

The sun was starting to rise, casting soft light through the trees, a light that felt like salvation. I let out a shaky breath, feeling my whole body begin to release the terror that had gripped me. That thing—whatever it was—had kept me frozen in terror for over four hours. The longest, most horrifying hours of my life.

The moment the forest was bright enough, I scrambled to my feet. I didn’t even bother with the campsite, leaving everything behind as I bolted down the trail. My heart pounded, adrenaline surging, and tears streamed down my face as I ran. I didn’t look back—I couldn’t. All I knew was that I had to get as far away from that place as possible.

Branches scraped my arms, and roots snagged my feet, but nothing slowed me down. The fear pushed me forward, every step taking me farther from the nightmare I’d somehow survived.

As I tore down the trail, my vision blurred by tears, I suddenly stumbled upon a pair of hikers making their way up from the direction I’d come. The sight of other people—real, human people—nearly broke me. I collapsed before them, trembling, my body giving in to the weight of the fear and exhaustion.

The hikers rushed over, their faces etched with alarm as they knelt beside me. They asked what had happened, if I was hurt, but I couldn’t speak. The terror choked my words, the images of the night still too raw, too vivid. I sat there, gasping, trying to steady my breathing, until finally, the lump in my throat loosened enough to speak.

“Something… something attacked my friend Alex,” I whispered, my voice barely audible.

The hikers exchanged a look, a mixture of concern and disbelief, but they didn’t question me. One of them offered me a bottle of water, and after a few moments, they guided me back down the trail. Every step felt like agony, my body heavy with the shock and fear of what I’d endured. It took two hours to reach the parking lot, two hours where I glanced back over my shoulder more times than I could count, fearing that I’d see those sickly yellow eyes watching me again.

When we finally reached the lot, I climbed into my car, my hands still trembling as I gripped the steering wheel. Without a second thought, I drove straight to the nearest police station, the fear still fresh in my mind as I prepared to file my report.

After filing my report, the officers exchanged wary glances before one of them asked me to accompany them back to the campsite. They didn’t say it outright, but I could see it in their faces—they didn’t believe a word I’d said. To them, I was just some distraught girl, maybe imagining things after a traumatic night. But despite their disbelief, they agreed to look into it.

An officer escorted me back through the trail, my heart pounding with each step. When we reached the campsite, I showed them where Alex had gone into the woods and the spot where I’d last seen him. The officer looked around, taking notes, his face carefully blank. He finally nodded, saying they’d open an investigation into Alex’s disappearance. But I could tell by his tone that he didn’t expect to find anything.

As he escorted me back to the parking lot, my eyes darted constantly to the surrounding trees, every rustling leaf and shadowed branch sending a fresh wave of dread through me. I half-expected to see that creature lurking, watching, waiting to strike. But the woods remained still, eerily quiet as we walked.

When we finally reached the lot, I climbed into my car, forcing myself to breathe, to focus. The officer gave me a final nod and a reminder to call if I remembered anything else, but I barely heard him. The moment I could, I turned the key, pulling out of the lot and driving home, my hands gripping the wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white.

All I could think of was Alex, lost somewhere out there in those woods—and the thing that had taken him.

The call came the next day. I could barely bring myself to pick up, a sick feeling twisting in my stomach as the officer’s voice came through the line, calm and practiced. They’d found Alex’s body at the base of a cliff. He said it was a long fall, and that Alex’s body had been badly mangled on impact.

I felt numb, the words barely registering as I listened. My mind raced back to the creature I’d seen, its yellow eyes glowing in the firelight, the way it had stalked us through the trees. I tried to tell them again—to make them understand that what had happened to Alex wasn’t just a fall. I told them about the monster, about how it had chased him into the woods.

But they dismissed it just as quickly as before. The officer’s tone was sympathetic but firm. “People die out there every year,” he said. “The cliffs are steep, and at night, it’s easy to lose your footing.”

He wouldn’t believe me. None of them would. To them, Alex’s death was just another tragic accident, a case closed. But I knew the truth. Something had hunted us, something that drove Alex over that cliff.

As I hung up, a hollow feeling settled in my chest. I was left with the terrible certainty that the monster in those woods was still out there, lurking, waiting for whoever was unfortunate enough to cross its path next.

Breaking the news to Alex’s parents was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. His mother’s face twisted with grief as the words left my mouth, and she collapsed, sobbing, unable to bear the weight of the loss. His father just stared at me, his expression dark and accusing, as if he somehow thought I was to blame. I couldn’t find the words to defend myself, not that they would have helped. I’d been there, and Alex hadn’t come home. That was all that mattered.

Since that day, I haven’t been able to set foot on a trail. The thought of being out in the woods again sends a shiver down my spine, and even the sight of a forest from a distance makes my skin crawl. I can’t sleep, either—not peacefully. When I close my eyes, I’m back at the campsite, under that cruelly bright moon, with the creature crouched just at the edge of the firelight, staring at me with those sickly yellow eyes.

Sometimes, I lie awake, wondering why it let me go. Why it didn’t finish me off when it had the chance. The question gnaws at me, but I know I’ll never have an answer. All I know is that it’s out there, waiting in the dark.

And no one will ever believe me.",85,0.94,5,InformationRemote865,2024-11-04 21:57:17,1gjy14c,90,High
NoSleep,I found something while renovating this old high school and I don't know what to do,"In my twenty-six years of life, I've never seen anything like this, and I don't know who to tell. I work for a construction contractor, and we gotta renovate an old high school that has been in use since like the 20's. I think it had been an alternative high school called Caron Hill High. Some folks around Hillside say it's haunted. 

I don't pretend to know much about all that. I dropped out of high school at seventeen and never got a GED and I’ve been kinda there most of my life. But this thing with Kennedy Lavalle still eats at me: why wasn't this in the news? There's no news of this girl or Charlotte Cruz, and I don't know what’s going on. 

Me and my buddy Lyle are supposed to do the girls' bathroom. We took down the stalls with all the fuckin’ graffiti and weird symbols and whatever. There was a weird one on a door, but teenagers are weird. It was quick work and I was like whatever, then we tackled stripping tile and gutting drywall. When we pulled back the tile, though, a sandwich ziploc bag fell out from a hole in the wall. In it was a thumb drive, a sticky-note with a weird symbol on it, maybe the one from the stall door, and an old vape pen. I probably should have reported it, maybe whined about the extra work to fill the hole in, but something just felt, I don’t know, off.

There was only a video file on the thumb drive. Here’s the transcript of it. It was just a teen girl talking, a few snippets of other videos edited in. She's sitting in a stall in the bathroom, I think probably this one. She was more on the goth side, I probably would have wanted to date her when I was younger. But she looked scared, really fucking scared, the mascara running down her face. She said impossible shit. 

She said ahem and started talking.

>My name is Kennedy Rose Lavalle. Um, I'm seventeen years old and I'm a junior at Caron Hill High School. My address is 726 Ironwood Lane and 22 East 9th Street North, depending on which parent I'm living with. My parents are Susanna Dee Burton and Jake David Lavalle. My mom drinks and lives in a trailer with my heroin-addict stepdad Danny Burton. My dad works on the oil fields in North Dakota for months on end. I have one blood brother, Peter, and a bunch of step-siblings I can't keep track of, including Danny's daughter Maya, who calls me her sister. That feels nice sometimes.

>I'm telling you this because I'm nobody, I'm trailer trash - and no one will look for me when I'm gone. But someone has to know. If you find this, I'm probably gone, just like Charlie. Try to get this to my family if you can - this is my last will and testament, I guess. The vape pen in the bag is if they find a body but can't identify it. Maybe my DNA can be identified as me and my family will finally give a fuck. If they don't, my best friend is Jordan Clark. Uh, he's a junior like me and is, like, extravagantly gay. I don't know his middle name. Sorry.

>I'm at Caron Hill High School for possession. Most kids get caught with a vape, but I got caught with a full-ass blunt in the Hillside High School bathroom and off to Caron Hill I went. My mom said I'm the best ""self-sabotager"" or whatever she knows, but it runs in the family. That's what made Charlie so intriguing to me.

>Charlie Cruz is a girl from my class. Her name is short for Charlotte. Her Spanish heritage, her blond hair and olive skin, makes her glow in the halls. We went to elementary school together and she was always beautiful. While most of us at Caron Hill are here for possession or behavior, Charlie took her freshman year off to help her mom recover from surgery. I forget what kind. Either way, she got behind.

>When she got here she immediately caught the eye of Michael Duran, the most popular guy at school. He was another one with a spotless record, although he and I smoked weed a lot with friends on the weekend. Michael was making moves on me and we had slept together once maybe after a party with too much tequila, so when Charlie told me he asked her out on a date, we realized how fucking shady that was. So Charlie and I made a pact and it made us friends, although I realize now that I probably took it more seriously that she did. She and I agreed that we would both ditch Michael and date each other to spite him. My heart leapt at the idea, because I'm pretty sure I loved her.

>Long story short, it didn't work out like that. Charlie dated Michael and I didn't really talk to either of them much again. Until Charlie went missing.

>Charlie's issue was absenteeism, sure, but she always kept Michael in the loop. I don't know, things like watching her brothers or her mom taking surprise trips to the city were normal, if I remember right. But this time there was nothing. No contact. Michael even asked me if I had heard from her, but nothing. He mentioned he went to her house and her mom said Charlie was supposed to be with him, but she was, like, knee deep in a bottle of rye whiskey and a hookah or something so she slammed the door in his face. Charlie was another nobody to the law so no one looked for her.

>Then the rumors started. I don't know who started them, but I heard them from Jordan that there was a TikTok or Instagram Live video somewhere Charlie had started at Caron Hill, and that the school security cameras showed that she never left the building. I managed to track down the video, which Charlie had posted to her Instagram story. Here.

Kennedy cut to a screen capture of the Instagram Live. It was night, in selfie mode looking at the sky. Charlie walked around, her face in view, trees and streetlights in the background. She was a pretty girl too, but there was something wrong. Something in the way that Charlie's eyes glinted in the nearby streetlights, in the way her smile stretched just slightly too far across her face, in the way she kept quiet and just kinda looked at the camera, that grin plastered on her face. I couldn't help but wonder what she was doing. The two-floor brick building of Caron Hill High School was right behind her. What was she doing at the school? Kennedy cut back to her video and continued talking.

>Yeah, I don't know either. That's not the Charlie I know. That Charlie grins too much, and I knew something was off. I got the help of Ben Ewing, or, uh - a senior who was at Caron Hill because he hacked into the system and changed his grades. He showed me how to view the surveillance footage from my phone. Sorry, I don't mean to implicate anyone.

>I could definitely see Charlie wandering around campus that night, late. She was just looking down at her phone while recording live, probably made at least five or six circuits around the school just looking at her phone. But then she just, I don't know, went into the building. I don't know how the door got open.

>Through the cameras I saw her movements, and what I saw I can't believe. I recorded what I could.

Kennedy cut to a screen capture again. This time of grainy surveillance from WideAngel, a grid of different screens showing the full campus, inside and out. One box was picked, and a camera above the front door showed Charlie enter and turn right, down the steps into the basement. Kennedy picked another view to the camera at the end of the basement hallway, and you could hear the door out of view open and close. I thought Charlie would start walking the length of the hallway, but it seemed she stopped just beneath the camera, so I couldn’t see her.

The hallway was long, and I had seen it myself. It runs the entire length beneath the gym and beyond, with windowed double doors at the end. I could hear Kennedy say ""Here, let me fast-forward,"" and the grainy footage sped up, the only movement the pixels, I don’t know, dancing, on the dark hallway and the slightly lighter windows at the end of the hall.

Then I saw it. Kennedy resumed normal playback. A silhouette of a man filled the windows at the end of the hall. Hands and face pressed against the frosty glass, but I couldn’t see nothing, but I couldn't tell if it was the glass or not. 

Two hands shot up from beneath. Charlie was still there beneath the camera, but her hands raised to the ceiling into view. Kennedy cut back to herself and continued:

>I don't know. I really don't.

>This continues until the sun rises nearly six hours later, Charlie's hands still up in, I don’t know, worshiping form. The figure disappears in the sunlight and her arms go down. But here's the thing: she never goes back up the stairs or down the hall, and there are no other ways out. School just resumes like normal the next day. ISS happens down there, so you can see Mr. Telles escorting kids down to the room and some others wandering through for lunch, but nothing more of Charlie.

>I tried to show my family, but they claimed I was smoking too much and wouldn't give me the time of day. Even Peter and Maya laughed. What was I supposed to do? The police would never take it seriously, especially given me as trailer trash and also having a probation officer for possession.

>So I took matters into my own hands. I hid in the bathroom one night, when I knew the janitorial staff was off, with my vape for courage and a can of Monster to stay awake. I cracked the can, took some puffs, and waited in the stalls.

>I tried so hard to stay awake but I couldn't. When I woke up I was slumped over against the stall, but it was more about \*what\* woke me up that freaked me the fuck out. Chanting. I couldn't make out whether it was multiple voices or one very fucked up one, distorted. It was almost like that throat singing thing that I've seen like Mongols do or something. I just know I froze, because it was coming from right outside the door.

>But what freaked me out the most is that there was now a symbol etched into the door - on my side. Someone had entered the bathroom while I was passed out and etched that fucking symbol on the door facing me - without me having heard it or seen it at all. And it's not like I could have missed it. I mean, the etching sound would have been loud. I wasn't that high. I drew that symbol.

She held up the sticky note for the camera. It looked like a cross from a church, but tilted to the left and a long line stretching down from the left beam. Kennedy kept talking.

>I’m scared shitless. My curiosity got the better of me. I followed the sound, and sure enough, it led to that damn basement hallway. I waited at the end like Charlie had done, but nothing happened. I walked down the hall, looking into the ISS room and the weight room and then...

Kennedy looked down and froze; she was so still I had to check the file to see if it was still running. She looked spooked, more terrified than anyone I had ever seen. A tear ran down her face. When she talked again, her voice was shaking.

>I saw movement. A figure darted past the window, and I couldn't help but look into the ISS room. Then I fucking saw it.

>A face emerged from the darkness, and it was smiling. The chanting had stopped and the face looked back at me, its mouth agape as if the funniest joke had just been told and its eyes wider than anything I'd ever seen. 

>It was Charlie. It was definitely Charlie Cruz, but a distorted, possessed version of Charlie. I said her name and she cocked her head like a dog, then she licked her lips. I asked her if she was okay, and I pleaded with her through the door that we were all missing her, but she didn't respond. I'll never forget the way she looked at me. Hungry. Cruel. Empty.

>It got worse. I couldn't stop looking, it was like a train wreck. But then another face emerged next to Charlie's. Same mouth agape, same eyes unnaturally wide, flickering horrifically in the red glow of the basement exit sign.

>It was \*me\* looking back. Me, Kennedy Rose Lavalle. I was looking at my own face, distorted and twisted and disgusting. But not like I felt about myself looking into the mirror on the day Charlie chose Michael instead of me. No, this was darker, so much darker. It was like looking into the pit of hell, like my father's angry fist in a look, like the bottom of mom's bottles as she reached for another. It was violent ambivalence and fatal apathy.

>I ran. I ran as fast as I could. My only consolation was that that was not Charlie, and maybe that wasn't me. But the other part of that is that if it wasn't me then I would disappear like Charlie. I’ve pleaded to whatever god is up there, but I can't help this feeling of all-consuming dread, like I’ve seen too much and there’s a price to pay. I'm doomed. Maybe I'll go to the same place as Charlie, and maybe we'll be together. I don't know.

>This all happened last night, and I need someone to know, so I’m hiding it here. Maybe they'll tear this goddamn building down and release whatever's here, or even better, kill it. So please, take this as a warning. Burn this building to the ground because whatever's here is wrong, so fucking wrong.

>My name is Kennedy Rose Lavalle. I'm seventeen years old and I'm a junior at Caron Hill High School. My vape for DNA if they find my body. The post-it note so you know what to look for. Signing off. 

The video stopped on this girl’s sad smile.

I'm scared. I can’t find anything with Kennedy Lavalle or Charlie Cruz, maybe I didn’t look hard enough. What do I do? How serious is this, and does anyone know anything about it? How do I convince my boss to listen to a random video of a scared teenage girl? Where do I go from here? I’m beginning to see her face out the corner of my eye.

NoSleep,My brother took his pranks too far ,"I'll keep this short and sweet because I just need to get this out of my head. I've already told everyone I know now all my closest friends think im fucking crazy. It's all his fault it's all landons fault he's the crazy one with all his stupid pranks trying to get a rise out of me. But this most recent shit is fucking horrible. 

My brother ever since he stopped seeing me as his cool older brother (he's 4 years younger than me) as loved messing with me making me angry. It started with pouring salt in my drinks or covering my bed in toilet paper and man that shit pissed me off. But I learned to acknowledge it but not let it get to me. You know I figured this was all because I wasn't spending enough time with him. So recently I did im now 19 and hes 14. We started watching all of dragon ball from the beginning it was our thing on fridays. He seemed to love it I'd always find him waiting for me on the couch. We'd have stupid arguments about who would win just normal brotherly conversations. But I guess I must've upset him somehow because he started again. 

A couple weeks ago I walked into the living room and sat down on the couch and called his name to come join me. And then his hand jetted out from under the couch. I cursed and asked him if he was okay under there. He just giggled. I laughed it off and leaned the couch back so he could crawl out. But when I saw him there on the floor this uneasy feeling came over me. He was sprawled out flat on his stomach every part of his body seemed perfectly flat on the floor. His arms and legs were all at 90 degree angles and his chin was perfectly flat on the carpet it looked like it hurt but he still had a stupid grin on his face. So I set the couch all the way down and picked him up by his arms. He let out a deep groan as he stood up not one like a kid his age would make. Then he turned to face me smiled innocently and asked, 
""What episode are we on again?"" In this casual way like he didn't just scare the life out of me. He acted completely normal all week. 

Friday came back around. I was filled with dread when I walked through the kitchen towards the living room with Landon being nowhere in sight. The clicking of the ice maker in the freezer making me jump as I creeper into the living room and looked under the couch both of them but he wasn't there. So I took a deep breath and I figured our mom hadn't brought him home yet. I live with my girlfriend Julie but I come over for the weekends to visit. So I walked to the kitchen and grabbed a glass from the dishwasher and walked to the fridge, the freezer right next to it was still making that awful noise so I banged on it trying to dislodge the ice, it would sometimes get stuck in the ice maker and make a clicking noise. When it didn't stop I frustratedly opened the freezer door only to scream when it swung open and I was met with my brother in the small freezer knees to his chin making a sickening click in his throat as he grinned at me wildly. My brother is not a huge guy but he is 5'10 and 140 lbs but looking at him curled up with bits of ice on him he looked like a five year old. I yelled angrily and yanked him out the fridge. I dragged him to the bathroom while he giggled not even attempting to stand up or stop me from dragging him. I brought him to the bathroom, through a towel around him, got in my car, and drove home. I told my girlfriend Julie about it and she really did feel for me, we'd been together for 4 years and she was well aware how I was trying to fix my relationship with Landon. I stayed in the house with her all weekend.

I went to classes and worked like usual all week and part of me thought I should call Landon but I couldnt bare to hear that fucking giggle again. When next Friday came I got a call from my mom saying Landon broke his arm playing inside the house and that he seemed pretty bummed that I wasn't there. And I'm glad I wasn't cause I didn't want to be the one to find him ""playing"" inside the house. It fucked me up I felt like I was going crazy he had taken this shit to far. The week passed and again I had no plans to see my ""brother"" on Friday. 

Julie has been my best friend for six years and my girlfriend for four and I plan to propose (if you see this babe sorry for spoiling the suprise) She is the best thing that ever happened to me and one of the reasons I stopped spending so much time with Landon. She's always pushed me to spend time with my family and they love her, I just don't get along with them too well they never wanted me to move out until my brother did. My brother has always hated Julie and once he started playing harmless but bothersome pranks on Julie was when I stopped bring her over. I've known I've loved her since our first kiss and I will never let anything happen to her no matter how small. 

Julie could tell that the situation with Landon  was really messing with me so she wanted to cheer me up. We watched a movie together and when it ended we went to our room for some personal time. We had both partially undressed so I leaned over to grap protection from the bedside dresser. As I opened the drawer I heard the last sound I wanted to hear. I heard that fucking giggle I heard that giggle from a three foot tall one foot deep dresser. I fucking lost it I grabbed my girlfriend and ran out to our car and drove for hours. We ended up driving to her parents house where I am now. 

I am writing this because I just got off the phone with my mom who was in hysterics about my father and Landon. I was later informed by the police that my father had been stabbed seven times in the chest and once in the temple. They said he dies instantly but the officers apprehension makes this hard to believe. They believe that Landon has ran away from home taking the murder wepon with him. A younger officer pulled me aside and gave me the actual briefing it makes me sick to just think about it. My father hadnt been stabbed seven times and he certanly didnt die instantly. He had his achilles tendon severed and was forcibly crammed into a fucking ac vent. He then showed me one of the crime scene photos it was of the bloody ac vent cover,l and next to it was a picture of me and julie when we were kids that my parents kept in the living room. On it in read was wrote, ""You 2 will fit in."" I don't know exactly what that means, but i have an idea. I have no fucking clue what happened to the my brother but i promise I'll kill that little shit before I'd let anything happen to Julie. 
We're safe right now but her parents are in Europe so it's just us here. 

Hopefully this won't go any further but if it does you'll be the first to know.

NoSleep,Cold Temptation,"The snow fell silently, a thick, suffocating shroud that blanketed the tiny rural town of Black Springs. My cottage sat at the edge of the village, surrounded by dense, snow-laden forest. The trees formed a natural barrier, their gnarled limbs twisting together and casting shadows even in the brightest daylight. At night, the forest became an endless void, its silence heavy and full of unspoken threats. I’d come here to escape the chaos of my past—a desperate bid for sobriety. But the quiet town harboured its own darkness, one that mirrored my own in ways I never could have imagined.

Earlier that day, a moment of weakness had led me to the liquor store. I bought the bottle, a heavy, shameful reminder of the life I’d tried to leave behind. Back in my small kitchen, the air felt thick with tension as I twisted off the cap. The scent of whiskey hit me, sweet and intoxicating, pulling me back to the haze of late-night parties and the allure of temporary oblivion. My hands trembled as I approached the sink.

Shadow, my black cat, watched me from atop the fridge. His green eyes glinted with an intensity that almost seemed human, as if he understood the gravity of what I was about to do. His tail flicked, and he tilted his head, waiting. With a deep, shaky breath, I tipped the bottle and let the amber liquid pour out. It swirled down the drain, a final goodbye to the life I was trying to leave behind. Shadow let out a soft, approving purr, then jumped down to rub against my leg, his warmth a small comfort.

I thought that would be the end of it. But as night fell, the darkness made itself known.

Later that evening, I curled up in the living room with a cup of herbal tea, trying to calm the storm inside me. The snow continued to fall, blanketing everything in a suffocating hush. Shadow sat by the window, staring out into the woods, his ears twitching at every creak and groan of the old house. The cottage felt too quiet, the kind of silence that presses in on you, amplifying your fears.

Then the old clock radio in the kitchen crackled to life, making me jump. It shouldn’t have turned on by itself, and my heart thudded as I listened to the song that began to play: *“Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)”* by Eurythmics. The opening notes were distorted and warped, but unmistakable. It was the song that had been the soundtrack to so many of my wild nights, playing in clubs thick with smoke and electric energy. Hearing it here, in this isolated place, felt like a cruel joke. A reminder of everything I was trying to escape.

I rushed into the kitchen and yanked the radio’s plug from the wall. The music cut off abruptly, leaving only the echo of my ragged breathing. Shadow had followed me, his back arched and fur bristling. I could feel the fear thickening in the room, an invisible presence pressing in on us.

That’s when I heard it: *Tap. Tap. Tap.*

It came from the living room window, deliberate and patient. The forest pressed up against that side of the house, and I imagined something out there, hidden among the trees, watching and waiting. My mouth went dry. I backed away, whispering to myself, “It’s just the wind.”

But Shadow didn’t believe me. He hissed, his tail puffed up, and bolted under the couch. The tapping moved, louder now, coming from the back of the house. I fumbled for my phone, but the screen stayed black—dead battery. A knock echoed through the house, deep and menacing, as if something was demanding to be let in.

I crept to the front door, every muscle tense. My hand hovered over the knob as another knock came, harder this time. I yanked the door open, hoping for a neighbour or a lost traveller, but the porch was empty. Snow whirled through the air, erasing any sign of footprints. The forest loomed, dark and forbidding, just beyond the edge of the yard.

I closed the door, locking it tight, but dread washed over me. The scent of whiskey curled through the air, and when I turned back to the kitchen, my heart stopped. The bottle of Jameson’s sat on the counter, full and taunting, as though I had never emptied it. A note was stuck to the glass, the words jagged and ominous: *Drink me. Escape your pain.*

My hands shook, panic flooding my veins. How was this possible? The bottle was a physical manifestation of my addiction, a reminder of the darkness that refused to let me go. A voice, cold and insidious, whispered in my ear, “Drink. Escape.”

Shadow emerged from his hiding place, his eyes wide and wild. He knew—he sensed the danger creeping into our sanctuary. Desperation fuelled my resolve. I grabbed the bottle and hurled it at the shadowy figure that had begun to coalesce in the corner of the room. The glass shattered, whiskey spilling across the floor. The figure recoiled, its form flickering and dissolving into the darkness.

Exhausted and terrified, I sank to the floor. Shadow leapt into my lap, purring softly, his small body a source of comfort. But the night was far from over. The tapping grew louder, and I felt a cold draft, as if a window had been opened. I sat up, heart pounding, and there he was—a tall, gaunt figure with hollow eyes, standing in the doorway. His smile was a chilling, toothless grin.

“You can’t escape,” he whispered, his voice a raspy, mocking echo. “We’re always here, waiting.”

I screamed, kicking out with all the force I could muster. My foot connected with his shins, and he stumbled back, cursing. I scrambled to the edge of the bed, but the door was locked, trapping me inside. The man’s laughter was a twisted melody, echoing through the room. “You can’t run,” he taunted. “We’re part of you.”

The room grew darker, the flickering flames in the fireplace casting distorted shadows across the walls. The man advanced, his form warping and twisting. I was paralysed with fear.

Suddenly, Shadow leaped at the figure, biting and clawing with a ferocity I’d never seen. The man howled, swatting at the small, determined cat. But Shadow was relentless, his claws tearing into the darkness. The man stumbled, weakened by the attack. I seized the moment, grabbing a heavy candlestick from the nightstand and swinging it with all my strength. It connected with a sickening crack, and the man’s form shattered, dissolving into the shadows.

Silence descended. The oppressive darkness retreated, and I was alone again. I sank to the floor, clutching Shadow, my protector, who now lay panting but triumphant beside me.

The first rays of dawn pierced through the curtains, casting a soft, ethereal glow over the snow outside. The world seemed peaceful, almost serene, but I knew better. The forest loomed beyond the window, thick and still, but filled with unseen threats. The darkness was still out there, lurking, waiting for its chance to return.

Shadow curled up beside me, purring contentedly. He was more than just a pet—he was my guardian, my companion in this battle. As I sat there, catching my breath, a familiar melody drifted through the air: *“Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This).”* This time, it was coming from somewhere deep in the forest, a haunting echo that promised the fight was far from over.

I knew I had to stay vigilant. The battle with the darkness was never truly over, but for now, I was still standing. And that, I realised, was a victory in itself.",26,0.96,3,ezekiel_h_graves,2024-11-04 22:56:05,1gjz26l,29,High
NoSleep,Bygone,"That’s the thing about getting old, isn’t it? The perspective. When you’re a kid, you think the whole world loves you. You can’t comprehend the idea of someone hurting you, and when someone or something does, it hurts that much more because of that lack of understanding. You can’t comprehend why the mean ants in the anthill began biting you after you stepped on their home. Then you become a teenager and you start thinking the whole world is out to get you, so you lash out at it. You want to make yourself known to the world. You get to adulthood, and you start thinking you can take on the world. It’s not until you realize that everyone else thinks something similar, that everyone else has that same ambition whether they realize it or not, and they’re willing to do whatever it takes even if it means trampling you unless you do the same. You ask yourself why someone would do this to you, and you realize something else. You realize that you’re little more than a blip, a gnat, dirt under someone’s fingernails. It hits you that you’re an ant, and something just destroyed your anthill.

My anthill was destroyed in the year 1968, when I was 27. Back then, I was studying archeology with the intent of uncovering evidence of civilizations people overlooked, nations beyond those born in Mesopotamia and Mesoamerica. I wasn’t some rugged, handsome adventurer type. Between my skinny build, glasses, and my mild-mannered disposition, the folks I spoke to probably thought I was some kind of clerk. I will say for the record, though, that I did carry a snub-nosed .44 with me whenever I traveled. Between the very real possibilities of grave robbers and the Kremlin’s finest, it was always comforting to have that weight on my belt.

The search I conducted took place in an Eastern European nation that I won’t name. For all I know, it lost its name during the collapse of the USSR anyway, as I’ve never found any records of it existing. I went there with a small team funded by an anonymous donor who had expressed interest in uncovering evidence of a lost civilization before the Soviet Union could find it. My team consisted of five others, Mike, Leo, Martin, Charles, and Keith. Mike and Leo were the medic and armed guard respectively, Martin and I were the people who handled the cultural and historical aspects of our journey, Charles was a linguist, and Keith was a quiet man sent by our donor to oversee the expedition, document our findings, conditions among the team, among other things. We often joked that he was also a hatchet man that our donor would use to keep us quiet about the operation. Maybe he was, maybe he wasn’t. If I knew then what I know now, I would have begged him to just shoot all of us there and then. I would have handed him my gun.

The ruins we found were located 120 kilometers outside of a small village beneath a mountain range, the name of which I won’t mention. It was a sad, empty place, to put it lightly. The moment we entered, we could see that the few tired, fearful villagers outside seemed to know what we were after, and they didn’t want us to find it. Even then, I couldn’t help but liken it to Jonathan Harker’s experience with the locals of Transylvania. This comparison persisted when Charles began to ask about the ruins, as he asked a local man about surveys conducted on the mountains. The man grew agitated and began to say things that Charles translated as, “We don’t talk about that place.” Naturally, this piqued our curiosity, so Charles offered to buy the man a drink at the local tavern in exchange for telling us what he knew. This gesture being the universal icebreaker, the gentleman, however reluctantly, took him up on it. He and Charles went into the tavern, and the rest of us waited, feeling the oppressive gloom of the town weighing on us. 

We tried to keep things casual, but that sensation persisted up until Charles emerged about an hour later. He said that he had used up half of the money in his wallet that he brought just to get the man to tell him anything, and what he said had been equal parts fascinating and eerie. According to the man, nobody who ventured into those mountains ever came back. At least, they never came back as themselves. There was always something odd about them. This oddness had resulted in no less than fifty people dying in his lifetime alone. He never discussed the exact circumstances, but Charles had enough empathy to not push him further, especially not when the man said own brother had been a casualty. He had told him that he didn’t know what lay in those mountains, but whatever it was, we would be entering at our own risk. At the time, we dismissed it as local superstition, as anyone would, and reasoned that anyone who came from the mountain and died had been affected by isolation, changes in air pressure, pre-existing mental and medical conditions, virtually anything that wasn’t supernatural. This village was old, and saw very few modern commodities, so it would make sense that they would rely on such things to see them through. Perhaps we were trying to reassure ourselves.

At any rate, the man had told Charles where to mark the location on his map, and with that, we soon departed from the village to begin the trek up into the mountains. As we left, I looked back and was unnerved to see that everyone in the village had turned out as if to bid us farewell. They said nothing, but the somber expressions on their sallow faces said that they genuinely thought we were headed to our dooms.

We hiked through the forest that grew along the mountain and by the fifth hour, we had thoroughly convinced ourselves that there was nothing to be afraid of. We took occasional breaks for meals and rest, but we were all quite eager to see what had our client so interested in these ruins. Martin and I engaged in frequent conversations over what civilization the structures belonged to, or if it was possible that people might even live there. This possibility in particular intrigued Martin, who postulated that we might happen upon a tribe or race of humans more cut off from the civilized world than the village. He regaled us with fantastical possibilities of our respective civilizations learning from each other. None of us had the heart to remind him that if there had been people still there, the mountains wouldn’t be as wild as they still were, lacking footpaths and markers among other man-made things that would keep them from getting lost. About two days passed, and we continued hiking deeper into the mountains. The further we climbed, the mistier the air became. It wasn’t until noon of the second day that we stumbled upon it, literally. Martin’s foot connected with a loose rock and he almost tumbled off the side of the mountain. Luckily we caught him and hoisted him back up. He was shaken, but no worse for wear. However, it was when we looked in the direction in which he almost fell that we saw it.

What we had previously mistaken for a mountain range was a circular formation of smaller “mountains”, something that shouldn’t have been geologically possible. It was as if a colossal mountain had previously existed, but something large, a meteor perhaps, had struck the pinnacle. The resulting impact had changed the mountain into something resembling an enormous “crown” of rock and trees. Between the mist and the illusory mountains on all sides, one would need to have traveled in the direction we had to understand the nature of it. But what struck us more than that was the inside of that “crown.” We all saw it clearly, even with the fog tenaciously blocking out the sun. We said nothing, but I know we all believed the same thing: what lay before us was impossible.

It was an edifice of immaculate and bizarre construction. It was constructed of a material like obsidian and possessing an almost pyramid-esque shape. The dread and confusion that had gripped us broke when Leo gruffly asked what we were waiting for. Pushing the dread to the side for now, we began to descend the other side of the mountain, which was far smoother than the outside. We were able to reach the bottom with ease, and, given Leo’s military background, he estimated that we could make a quick and easy escape. As he said that, I felt the dread that already permeated the air around us slither down my spine. Why would we need to escape? If these ruins were mere ruins, then the only thing to fear would be hostile locals, which should have been little issue to a man accustomed to warfare. But the tone of his voice told me that it wasn’t men he was afraid of. No, he didn’t know what he was afraid of, and that in turn frightened us. 

Trying to put brave faces on it, we began walking towards the structure, and the closer we got, the more it seemed unlike anything made on Earth. What I had initially mistaken for a pyramid had eight sides, and at the top of it was a strange, cube-like object that rotated slowly, letting out odd pulsing sounds as it glowed. Had I not known better, I might have thought that this thing was acting as a kind of artificial sun. Something I also noticed was that it seemed smaller in scale than it appeared from a distance, like some kind of optical illusion. What I had taken to be a twenty-foot-tall behemoth was in truth no bigger than an average suburban home. Before us stood a narrow entrance that was lit up perfectly by the cube. Without warning, the cube ceased its motions, and the structure shifted. All of us had, until that point, basked in awe at the impossibility of this thing that we didn’t notice the opening changing to a gaping maw. Once we noticed it, though, the implications were clear.

Whatever this thing was, it was alive, and it was inviting us in.

I don’t know why we went in. Maybe we had been taken by some hypnotic effect of the cube’s light. Maybe we were exercising our natural human curiosity. Maybe it was what we found inside. In any case, we did, though Leo insisted on taking point, aiming his rifle ahead of us. The hall that we strode down had changed to accommodate our numbers, allowing for easy access and traversal of it. The distance to the central chamber was only about fifteen feet or so. Beside me walked Martin, who had grown silent in comparison to his optimistic, chatty self. Until that moment, I had never truly noticed just how young he was. He was only twenty-two, but the look in his eyes seemed to be that of a boy of six. They were open wide as he looked back at me, his gaze conveying raw, childlike terror. They told me he didn’t want to go a step further. His feet, however, told a different story, and with each step he grew increasingly afraid. I tried to reassure him, but I knew we all felt it: the instinct to continue despite all reason telling us to flee, the voice in our heads coaxing us deeper into the structure. And so, unwittingly, we trailed behind Leo as he aimed the gun. It felt like an eternity before we finally reached the chamber. But what a chamber it was. The walls were decorated with markings reminiscent of hieroglyphics, all of which glowed with the same light as the cube. But what drew our attention, what changed the entire situation for us was the thing in the center of the chamber.

My fingers shake as I write this, even as I’ve had years to ponder its appearance. That thing had only the vaguest impression of a human being. It seemed to have the appearance of some ghastly hybrid between a man, an insect, and some great, soft amoeba. At first, none of us made a move to approach it. We just watched as the light pulsed from it, realizing that it was the source of the ethereal glow. For a moment, we thought it was either dead or a bizarre statue of some kind. Then it happened. From the chair it was seated in, it rose, and within a billionth of a second, it crossed the distance between itself and us. Reaching out some mix between an arm and a pseudopod, it dashed poor Martin’s skull against the wall, then turned to the rest of us. It stood at ten feet tall, gazing at us with eyes that were barely visible behind its jelly-like head. 

When we regained our wits, Leo began firing at it wildly. He had only gotten a few shots off before it casually swatted a hand through the air. His gun fell to the ground in neatly cut pieces, and he slowly turned to us with a look of befuddlement in his eyes. Thin lines of red began forming on his body before he fell to the ground, his entire form surgically sliced before it went to work on Mike, Charles, and Keith. They tried to make a run for it, but it just swatted them, giving them the same fate as our other teammates. I collapsed to the ground, too shocked to register anything at first. Then I fully understood what had happened and I retrieved my revolver. I fired all the chambers but one, screaming like a lunatic. When the bullets passed through it with no effect, it lowered its head to where the projectiles had connected, then looked at me. Realizing what it was about to do, I placed the gun beneath my chin, intending to deny it the satisfaction of killing me. Then the creature knelt quickly and took my arm, which flopped limply and dropped the gun. It extended one of its limbs and touched my forehead. Instantly I felt a surge run through my head, probing my mind, filling it with pictures, words, questions, and memories that weren’t my own. Somehow, I knew what it was doing. It was trying to communicate with me. I felt its emotions. It gazed at me, curiosity radiating from its mind. Then a new feeling emitted from it. It was excitement, rapture, joy. This creature, after effortlessly murdering my friends, was excited. It must have sensed my shock and confusion because I instantly felt it sending another series of words and pictures to my brain.

This creature wasn’t a “little green man” that I’d watched on B-movies. It wasn’t from outer space. It was from a completely different plane of existence, and it was dedicated to exploring other worlds and universes beyond its own. We were standing in its mobile laboratory.

It was a researcher similarly to me, and by its people’s standards, it was around my age. The creature—which I came to call the Explorer—had come to this universe to study its energy and that of the living beings in it. What got to me the most, though, was the enthusiasm with which it probed my mind. It viewed me the way I might view an animal, an insect, but it was overjoyed to find a “lower” life form that possessed similar goals. It thought of me as a kindred spirit, a refreshing change from the “lower” intelligences it had encountered, i.e., the villagers and my friends.

Tears ran from my eyes as my overwhelmed mind was made to process this information. The Explorer sensed my distress but it didn’t understand. I felt confusion from it. It pulled away, then looked at the bodies of my companions. It seemed to think that was the reason for my emotional state, but while that was one reason, its means of “apologizing” only made me scream. The Explorer’s hands passed over the bodies of Mike, Leo, Martin, Charles, and Keith. They were seamlessly repaired and in a moment they were standing there, staring ahead vacantly. Their bodies were alive, but they were gone, and their reanimator didn’t understand why I was wailing in pure horror. They were like butterflies pinned on picture frames. I stood up shakily, and began running. I sprinted up to the mountainside, then as I began to retrace our steps, my sprint slowed to a jog, then a slow, plodding walk. I knew it was following me, eyes as inquisitive as ever. Somehow the Explorer went with me, traveling beyond its laboratory, possibly by astral projection or some other bizarre means. I walked non-stop, eventually reaching the village. Initially the people assumed defensive positions, but as they saw my vacant expression, their stony expressions faded to confusion then fear and pity. I think they knew the Explorer was following me. I kept walking, past the village and to the nearest civilized area kilometers away.

When I got home, of course my benefactor had questions, as did the families of my partners. The best explanation I could give was that there had been a deadly rockslide, that there were no ruins, and the mountain was unstable. I received my pay, and the families received large settlements. Whether it was hush money or a genuine attempt to make up for what they had lost, my benefactor never said. I quit archeology in the field, taking up a teaching position instead. I was always certain to tell my class to be careful when studying ancient folklore, and to take the word of the locals if something seems off.

Time passed. The USSR fell, technology advanced, and I gradually aged. The Explorer continued to follow me and watch me, like I was bacteria beneath a microscope. I would always see it somewhere, standing in an alley, watching from a window, and every night since, it’s stood at the foot of my bed. I’ve experienced things that should have killed other people. I’ve been in car wrecks that totaled my vehicle, but left me without a scratch. I’ve fallen from heights that should have crippled me at best and walked away with no damage from shocked civilians. I’ve seen armed muggers seized by an unknown force, crumpled like paper, and dashed against walls. In all circumstances and more, the Explorer was there, its influence obvious. It wouldn’t let me die. And why would it? I was its prized subject, its worthy counterpart. I resented it once, but as time went on, I couldn’t find it in me to feel that way. It was too emotionally taxing to curse something that didn’t even understand human emotion. The Explorer isn’t malicious, but it's no friend either; it’s a young, excited researcher like I was, maybe like Martin.

The thing is, as powerful as it is, it can’t reverse or stop aging or illness. Now that I’ve reached my twilight years, one might think I’d be relieved, knowing that my torment is near an end, and what’s more, thyroid cancer has me dead to rights. I only have about a year left. I’m not eager or relieved, though. I’m terrified, almost as terrified as the first time I saw the Explorer. This is because once it realized I was at the end of my rope, the Explorer began to grow frantic. It knew its best subject was near death, and after witnessing my reaction to my friends being brought back, it seemed to understand that after death, humans can’t simply return, not completely. That seemed to give it an epiphany. For the first time since I met it, the Explorer vanished. I had become so used to seeing it that for the three days it was gone, I was afraid of what it would do. Then it returned, and it had brought with it a “gift” for me. After seeing these gifts, I broke down greater than I had before, to the point of absolute despair.

As I said at the beginning, the thing about getting old is that your perspective changes. When you think of what monsters are, you think of boogeymen, hostile aliens, and even fellow humans. Sometimes, though, the most terrifying monsters are creatures that don’t even know they’re hurting you, that are confused by your trauma and consider your mind to be worthy to their own. Sometimes, your anthill isn’t destroyed by sadistic kids, but by someone who thinks they’re helping you. Sometimes in the intent to help a hapless bug, you’re forcing it into a far worse situation. The Explorer realized that it hadn’t been able to return humans to their fully human states post-mortem, and the idea of losing me after such a short time—by its standards—was unacceptable. So it decided to give me a second chance. Standing perfectly still in front of my bed, with the Explorer in the background, were Mike, Leo, Martin, Charles, and Keith. Their bodies hadn’t aged, and they were smiling affably at me. From the Explorer, one single word was projected into my mind.

*Choose.*

NoSleep,Never Watch Old Home Movies,"Back over the 4^(th) of July my family all got together at my parent’s house, and while I was over there my mom told me that she and my dad were remodeling their basement and asked me to get the rest of my stuff out. And as a quick side note, I’m going to change or omit my kids’ names for privacy, but didn’t think it much mattered with everyone else for reasons you’ll understand later.

I’m 39, and haven’t lived there in years, but had a handful of old belongings that I’d never bothered to take with me – mostly old things from my childhood that I didn’t have much need for, but held sentimental value, like a few favorite dolls and stuffed animals, old art projects and the like. Thankfully, my mom had had it all in storage containers for years, making it easy to grab a few and take home with me.

My sister, Nat, and her family live out of state and were staying at my parents through the weekend, and my kids had their cousin, Nat’s daughter, Biggsie (it’s a nickname) stay at our house the following night since it was Friday. Looking for something to keep the kids busy that night, and feeling nostalgic, I went digging through the storage bins I’d taken home with me and found some old VHS tapes with haphazardly made labels reading things like “The News with Lizzy at 5”, and “Primetime Update”.

When we were kids, my sisters Nat (the youngest), Stefi (middle) and I (oldest) used to have a blast making home videos, and our favorite subject by a mile was to create news shows with an anchor and then cut to different reporters on scene, covering stories consisting of either sensational events acted with our toys, human interest stories of us showing off our childish talents and hobbies, or ambush interviews and coverage of our parents and their friends. And one time the pizza man, who in hindsight was a pretty good sport about it.

The subject matter, more often than not, was not only ridiculous but also rather morbid, or at least grotesque, since vampire Cabbage Patch kids attacking pet rabbits was much more fun and imaginative than more realistic news.

This seemed like a perfect opportunity to show my kids and my niece what their moms got up to when we their age, while I took a walk down memory lane at the expense of my husband cracking jokes and never letting me live it down.

I randomly grabbed one of the tapes, and gathered everyone in the basement where we still have an old DVD/VHS combo player hooked up for the kids to watch old DVDs on occasion. After a minute or two of messing with the tracking and making sure the component cables where in the right ports, I got the tape playing to see my 8-or-so year old self sitting at a little blue and yellow plastic table with a notebook and pencil in hand, and giant glasses from the ‘70’s on, trying my darndest to look like a serious and sober news anchor. 

8-year old me had hardly gotten through saying “Welcome to Lizzy’s News Tonight…” when my husband, oozing sarcasm, said “SOOOO exciting, I better go make popcorn,” and got up to head upstairs before adding, “see kids, mom looked like a lollipop with her giant head on a tiny body too!”

The kids and I watched through the first segment, featuring me reporting on The Amazing Stefi, a magician who was going to saw Nat in half inside a carboard refrigerator box using a plastic toy saw. Nat, wearing her favorite Discovery Channel tee that she would never grow into, climbed inside the box, sticking her head out one end, while what were supposed to be her legs emerged out the other side.

As I watched, it crossed my mind that I had no idea whose legs those were. I know we occasionally would make these movies with friends and other neighborhood kids, but couldn’t remember who would’ve been with us by themselves, since all of our friends would come with their siblings, or whose legs would’ve been close enough to match tiny Nat’s. Looking closely, I also noticed something that initially seemed curious, but came to feel deeply disturbing.

 That pair of legs also didn’t seem to look quite right. It was hard to tell since they were only visible below the knee, but they seemed to bend the wrong way, were a bit too greyish for healthy skin tone, and the overall shape and curvature just wasn’t quite right. For the time being, I shrugged it off, chalking it up to poor VHS image fidelity, and made a mental note to go back and show my husband when the kids weren’t watching.

By the time the segment was over, the kids had already began to get distracted with other things, and grown board of the 4 minutes of old video, so I turned it off and we went on with our night.

Later, after the kids were asleep, and my husband was upstairs entranced with his video games and giving me that “do not disturb” on penalty of death vibe, I got the urge to go watch some more.

After another few news segments, of which the only real value is in sentiment to me and my sisters so I won’t bore you by recounting them, my 8-yr old self cut into her own report with “Breaking News” about a tragic accident that had taken place.

The hair on my neck raised a bit as the tone of this segment took a turn, like a dark pall had come over us, and even though we appeared as though we were outwardly having fun making a video, we were emptily going through the motions. Something just felt off.

I was playing the reporter again, on the scene in our room, covering the tragic story of a little girl gone missing. Stefi played the distressed sister, who explained that they missed her so much, and that after everyone and the police had searched for days, they were alerted by a “really, really gross smell” to discover that the girl, played by Nat, had fallen backwards off the top bunk, breaking her neck and getting lodged between the wall and the lower bunk. And while Stefi sat up on the bed holding her nose from the stench, I brought the camera over to show Nat curled up awkwardly upside down between the bed and the wall, pretending to be dead.

This shocked me, to say the least. I certainly don’t remember every little video we made, but I have a vague recollection of a lot of them, and even though we often enacted macabre stories, even involving someone dying, this felt outside our realm.

Having had enough at this point, I turned the TV off and called it a night.

 The next morning I heard the kids awake much earlier than I’d have liked, but wasn’t too surprised given the sleepover, and reminded myself to be thankful that at least it was Saturday, and popped my head in to say good morning and see what they wanted me to make for breakfast, since it was a special morning with their cousin here.

I opened the door and said, “Good Morning! Rise and shine!” with my biggest, kid-patronizing, smile, to find my kids horsing around together on the bed, but then immediately noticed something odd.

“Where’s Biggsie?”

“Right here!” my youngest daughter exclaimed, grabbing her pink dinosaur stuffed animal and proudly holding it up.

I played along, “Ohhh, my, you look quite unwell this morning Biggsie, maybe you need some breakfast!” but while the youngest laughed, the older two gave me a confused look.

I closed the door and let them be for a few minutes, figuring it was better to let their game run its course, but when I came back they still seemed to be at it.

“Okay, enough fun, but we need to have some breakfast and get Biggsie back over to Nonna and Nonno’s, and Auntie Nat.”

My youngest laughed again, and said something like “no no, Biggsie lives here,” but the other two seemed suddenly concerned.

“I don’t get it,” said my oldest.

“Get what?” I said, now confused myself.

“Who’s Auntie Nat?”

The whole room went cold, like the curtains had suddenly been drawn, and I immediately switched to serious mom mode.

“Ok, it’s not funny anymore. Where is Biggsie hiding.”

“Right there!” said my oldest, pointing to the stuffed dinosaur, and looking alarmingly earnest.

“Stop it now, or no fireworks tonight.”

“But that’s Biggsie!”

“I’m serious. I will go get your dad,” I said sternly, but was more frightened than angry.

The youngest had started crying, and tears were welling up in the other two.

“That IS, Mom, I swear. I don’t know what you want me to say. What did we do?”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
Everyone swore they had no idea who Biggsie was, and I turned the house inside out trying to find her. At first I thought maybe my husband got the kids to play a very unfunny prank on me – because that is totally something he would do – but after angrily arguing with he and the kids for a half our about it, I called Nat, but got no answer, so I tried my mom and dad. They claimed not to remember Biggsie either, and when I got frustrated and asked how on Earth they couldn’t remember Nat’s kid, they hung up on me.

I called Stefi, who I knew wouldn’t ever have participated in this obnoxious joke, and was momentarily relieved to hear her say “of course, I know Biggsie.”

“Oh thank God, I thought I was losing my mind, and then when Nat wouldn’t answer her phone I thought I was going to fall to pieces!”

“Ok, that’s not funny, Liz,” Stefi said, suddenly very serious.

“What?” I responded, confused.

“Don’t ever say something like that again.”

“Like WHAT?” I said, incredulously.

“Yeah, I’m done with this conversation,” Stefi said and hung up.

Ignoring her for the moment, and more than a little annoyed, I walked into the other room to triumphantly gloat to my husband that Stefi confirmed Biggsie, and I’d had enough of the stupid joke, so she could come out from wherever she’s been hiding now.

“Stefi remembers Biggsie, and is on my side and doesn’t think the joke was funny, you’re such a dick.”

“Well of course she is.”

“Whatever.  Seriously now though, we need to get Biggsie back to my parents or Nat will be pissed, since they have to drive home today. We don’t have time for this anymore.”

“Wow, who’s the one making unfunny jokes now?” he said with added condescension.

“I don’t get it. What do you mean?”

“What do YOU mean?! Bringing your sister that died when you were little into this. That’s not something even I would joke about.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It has been months now. No one remembers Biggsie as anyone other than my daughter’s pink dinosaur, I can't find any evidence of my sister Nat, and everyone swears that she died horribly as a child in a story that made the news after she fell behind the bunk bed and we unknowingly slept next to her dead body for days.",192,0.99,11,two-hip,2024-11-04 10:15:26,1gji38p,203,High

ExplainLikeImFive,"ELI5: If someone stayed in a calorie deficit but ate every hour, would they still lose weight?","Let's take the hypothetical Joe Schmo as an example:

Joe is 23 years old, male human. He works a mostly sedentary office job (cybersecurity bLala, jk love u), and struggles with insomnia, usually getting just 4–5 fragmented hours of sleep each night. He’s 5'11"" (1.8m) and weighs 77.1 kg (170 lbs). According to [chatgpt.com](http://chatgpt.com) his maintenance calories is \~2500. Though he’s largely inactive, he manages to run once or twice a week. 

Now, recently Joe Schmo saw Chris Hemsworth eat a Corn Thin and assumed that's all Chris eats. Inspired by his bodily idol, Joe switched to an all-Corn-Thin diet, consuming 1 or 2 corn thins every hour, including brief wakes during his sleep (about every 90 minutes). Each corn thin has 23 calories, so Joe ends up eating around 20–40 corn thins daily, for a total intake of about 460–920 calories—far below his maintenance needs.

However, corn thins have a high glycemic index (GI), meaning they’re quickly converted into glucose, causing a rapid blood sugar spike. This, in turn, triggers a large insulin response. Since insulin promotes glucose uptake in tissues and suppresses lipolysis (the process of breaking down stored fat for energy), Joe’s insulin levels would remain elevated throughout the day, theoretically inhibiting fat burning.

  
So, here’s the question: **Would Joe lose weight despite consistently high insulin levels, given that he’s in such a significant calorie deficit?**

Edit: my question is more like how would Joe’s body overcome his hormone response to sustain the energy needs of his body? 

Also, I’m not asking about whether corn thins diet will result in fat loss. I just chose a random high-GI, low calorie food. Ie. high glucose = big insulin spike. ",0,0.48,101,Typical_Basil342,2024-11-13 17:05:21,1gqqbuc,101,High

But that doesn’t square with the fact that the resistor is limiting the current being drawn from the gpio pin itself.

With apologies, I know the core concept has been explained many times. But there's something major missing. I think I understand the basic idea:

Neural network tries random 'noise', compares it to desired outcome, repeats, feedback loop that mathematically narrows it down to the outcome with best results.

So, that appears to be what's happening if you repeatedly tap the middle option on predictive text. Each word statistically likely most likely to follow the preceding word(s). I understand that, but it's nonsense.

But what are the extra parameters being used on say, chatgpt, which aim for context, an overall sentiment, etc? How do neural networks determine what to look for?

IAmA," I'm a brain damaged man who wrote some music - Ask me anything!
","TLDR; Got brain damage and made some music to cope. Link to music at the bottom of post.

Hello Reddit.

Six months after becoming a father, I had an accident which resulted in PCS (Post Commotio Syndrome), which is classified as a mild traumatic brain injury.

I was quite reduced and had to quit my work. My vision was damaged and I had severe mental fatigue. No longer able to plan, do logistics, or even think very well, I mostly acted on instinct, and had to rest in a dark room for 30 minutes for every hour that passed.

Things were pretty difficult for the entire family. But we managed as best we could. Thankfully, my son, being six months old, was to young to understand what was happening.

In the early morning hours, when I was looking after my son I started playing some simple chord progressions on my guitar. It felt good to play, and it seemed like he didn't mind at all, singing along in his blabbering way. I could only play about five minutes a day due to my sound sensitivity and mental fatigue, but those five minutes meant a lot to me. It made me feel peaceful and a bit productive I think.

I started to record the riffs and vocals on my phone, and when I had the energy I wrote down some lyrics.

I think it became a way of therapy for me. Writing down feelings which I did not have the energy or courage to express to anyone.

Anyway, all this resulted in six songs, which I recorded over a time span of two years.

The result is quite unpolished and raw, but I might as well share it.

So, if you want to hear how songs written, sung and played by a brain damaged man sounds like, be my guest and take a listen in the link below.

IAmA,"I am a broker for business brokers, possibly the only person in the world doing this full time. Ask me anything ","My name is [Clinton](https://postimg.cc/PvHkgZhc). For the last (almost) ten years, I've been doing a full time job in the UK that is something I haven't come across anyone else doing (whether in the UK or elsewhere).

When business owners want to sell a business, they tend to go to a business broker / M&A firm / investment bank. In the UK, there are about 1,000 firms who handle the sale of businesses. Choosing the right one is difficult.

I have an extensive database of who does what, the geographical area they cover, the fees they charge, their sector expertise and all kinds of other information.

If the business is small, they are often better off doing a DIY sale and I have [plenty of free info](https://ukbusinessbrokers.com/gallery/) on my site to assist them do a DIY sale without having to pay any fees.

If they business is larger, say 5 million in revenue or 500K in profit, I charge them a fee to assist them find the broker (or, more accurately, ""advisory firm"") best suited to that particular business and the owners' exit goals.

It's a strange job, sure, but I've come across a lot of interesting stuff in my time. Ask Me Anything. :)

IAmA,I am one of the first women to sue Texas over the abortion bans after being denied a medically necessary abortion - AMA,"https://preview.redd.it/2j3rjvsbdryd1.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1db280610d31247b42164b40bf091d7ca3343832

Howdy,

I am Lauren Miller. In March 2023, I (alongside four other patients and two doctors) [sued Texas](https://reproductiverights.org/case/zurawski-v-texas-abortion-emergency-exceptions/zurawski-v-texas/) over the abortion bans after being denied an abortion of an unviable twin, which would have protected me and our viable twin.

I was one of the women featured in the Diane Sawyer and Rachel Scott documentary, [On the Brink](https://www.hulu.com/series/impact-x-nightline-on-the-brink-6908932d-1ba7-46ec-84d9-499cfcdf8e28?dl=false), and a more in-depth look at our case was the subject of the recently-released documentary, Zurawski v Texas [(watch free here)](https://watch.eventive.org/togetherfilms/play/670db1d13a247100e803df13). I kept a journal logging my experience in real time, a small selection of which was published in [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/19/diary-woman-fled-texas-for-abortion).

In short: I was severely ill with hyperemesis gravidarum (heading towards kidney failure) due to a twin pregnancy. At 13 weeks, we found out that one of our twins would not survive. Despite additional ultrasounds, testing, and ending up in the ER for a second time, I was not dead enough for an abortion in Texas to preserve my health and the life of our healthy twin (that is even what the State of Texas said in response to our lawsuit). My husband and I had to go to Colorado so I could get a single fetal abortion. Thanks to my abortion, I delivered our healthy twin in March 2023, two weeks after we filed our case.

I have submitted and/or told my story under oath multiple times. I have also testified before the [House Ways and Means](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DACQf3uyflJ/?igsh=MXF2cnlrcG1wc2w4MA==) Committee and the [Senate Judiciary](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/crossing-the-line-abortion-bans-and-interstate-travel-for-care-after-dobbs) Committee.

Hey Reddit, Charles Blow, Lydia Polgreen and Michelle Cottle here. We've been closely watching the presidential election play out and written extensively about the Trump and Harris campaigns. Today, we’ll dive into Trump's victory and what to expect next. Ask us anything!

From Charles: I write about national politics, public opinion and social justice, with a focus on racial equality and L.G.B.T.Q. rights. I’ve been a columnist at Opinion since 2008. I am a political analyst for MSNBC, and I live in Atlanta. Recently, I explained how [Trump has embraced vulgarity](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/opinion/donald-trump-arnold-palmer.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Uk4.vKwf.QXHqrtsji93e&smid=re-nytopinion) to exploit the gender gap among particularly young voters.

From Lydia Polgreen: I write about the world, culture and politics, with an emphasis on human rights, migration, queer lives and democracy. I spent a decade as an international correspondent for The Times in West Africa, South Asia and South Africa. “Whether Harris wins or loses, it is hard to escape the feeling that the past year has produced a tragic victory for Trump’s scapegoating of Muslims, leaving many Arab and Muslim Americans feeling expendable,” [I argue in a recent column](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/opinion/trump-harris-gaza-arab-americans.html?unlocked_article_code=1.XU4.6GoJ.GObL5CZTdjyB&smid=re-nytopinion).

From Michelle Cottle: I recently reflected on some of the most [defining moments of this campaign season](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/opinion/election-trump-harris-campaign-review.html?unlocked_article_code=1.XU4.gPP2.LHaWyXCgbtne&smid=re-nytopinion), from Donald Trump’s indictments to Project 2025. I have covered Washington since the Clinton administration and am a host of “Matter of Opinion,” a weekly podcast where I discuss a singular topic with my colleagues.

We’ll start answering questions at 12 p.m. E.T. on Wednesday, November 6th.

IAmA,[Crosspost] AUA! OCCRP - We're some of the investigative journalists behind The Crime Messenger project. Ask Us Anything!,"Hi! We are OCCRP,  an international network of investigative journalists who expose organized crime and corruption around the world.

We’re here to talk about our recent investigation, The Crime Messenger, revealing how Sky ECC encrypted phones became a go-to tool used by criminals to coordinate logistics for drug trafficking, murders, and more.

Alongside 12 media partners across Europe and Canada, we learned that Sky Global didn’t just end up in the hands of criminals — criminals themselves were selling the phones.

We’re joined today by three colleagues who investigated Sky Global in their own countries: **Stevan Dojcinović**, an OCCRP editor who also leads the investigative newsroom KRIK in Serbia, where horrifically brutal gangs were some of Sky’s biggest fans; **Hakan Tanriverdi**, a German journalist with Paper Trail Media, which is releasing a multi-part podcast on Sky; and **Frédéric Zalac**, a Canadian reporter who dug into the roots of the Vancouver-based company and its distributors. **We welcome your questions — Ask Us Anything!**

Thank you to for hosting this live event, scheduled for Wednesday, November 6 at 1:30 p.m. Toronto + NYC + Washington D.C.  / 7:30 p.m. Amsterdam + Berlin + Belgrade.

**You may also submit questions in advance.**

The Crime Messenger is built on leaked investigative files from a Paris court case involving Sky Global’s founder and others. With help from 12 media partners across Europe and North America, we found evidence that executives looked the other way as convicted criminals became trusted distributors of their tech. (The company has denied any wrongdoing, and its founder has maintained his innocence.)

Check out the project here: [https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-crime-messenger](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-crime-messenger).

You’ll find an interactive map showing cases where decrypted messages exposed the inner workings of criminal schemes, leading to charges and convictions.

Plus, don’t miss our 20-minute documentary, which shows how Serbia’s notorious Principi gang used encrypted Sky phones to plan murders, share gory photos, and taunt rivals.

With phones considered uncrackable and the backing of Serbian officials, they killed like no one was watching.

Looking forward to your questions!

IAmA,AMA about experience as a litigant suing Government officials in India. I have successfully sued government officials in High Court and received favorable orders,"[https://imgur.com/a/2FwclVv](https://imgur.com/a/2FwclVv)

While refusing to pay a bribe for updating land records, I have successfully sued local officials in High Court in India four times. Despite orders from the High court, officials drag their feet but I refuse to cave in.

AMA about experience as a litigant in India, where corruption is still rampant.


----

TLDR; I have been pursuing the update our land records at the office of Bangalore Urban Deputy Commissioner ***[Details of #mystory in the Change petition](https://www.change.org/RevenueKarnataka)***


Last year, an agent working with the revenue department officials approached me and asked for a HUGE fee - amount ranging from ₹10-15 lakhs!

As the officials dragged their feet, I took the matter to Karnataka High Court. The honorable court passed an order in my favor on 28 March 2023

When officials still refused to act per the order on time, my lawyer filed a contempt of court against the Bangalore Urban Deputy Commissioner (DC). The Karnataka High Court had issued a Contempt of Court Notice to Bengaluru Urban Deputy Commissioner & Revenue Department on 14 Aug 2023

Some might argue that I could/should simply have paid the damn bribe and moved on, but it is not easy to navigate the web of corruption where touts also cheat favor seekers.

IAmA,"We are researchers studying ageism, end of life care and digital exclusion based on age. We work at the Centre for Death and Society at the University of Bath. Please Ask us Anything! ","Hi Reddit, we are researchers interested in ageing and society.

Dr Bethany Simmonds is a [Senior Lecturer and Programme Lead for Sociology at the University of Aberystwyth](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/dges/staff-profiles/listing/profile/bes88/) and a Visiting Fellow at the Centre of Death and Society with nearly twenty years’ experience and expertise in researching age and ageism, particularly in health and social care settings.

[In her recent research](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sociology/articles/10.3389/fsoc.2024.1372926/full), she discusses how some health care decisions on whether to give treatment, particularly during the first wave of the pandemic, were based on age rather than whether someone was healthy, or likely to survive. But a lack of dignity and care for older people has been a problem for decades in the UK. Because of the changes to the health and social care system and austerity measures, decisions for older people’s care are often based on cost rather than need. So if you have any questions about how we can improve the care of older people, please ask Bethany.

Bethany is also interested in answering any questions on digital exclusion in later life, which again have been highlighted since COVID-19. She would like to hear how digitally accessing art and creative activities, volunteering, paid work, banking services, benefits, pensions and other everyday services could be made more accessible for older people?  Please get in touch with any suggestions or questions for Bethany, please Ask Her Anything!

Dr Chao Fang is a [Lecturer in Sociology at the University of Liverpoo](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/sociology-social-policy-and-criminology/staff/chao-fang/)l and a Visiting Research Fellow at the Centre for Death and Society, University of Bath. He is also the Deputy Director of the Centre for Ageing and the Life Course.

Chao has extensive experience in researching death, dying, and ageing. By focusing on loss as a fundamental life experience, he has conducted numerous research projects to examine what loss means to people in different contexts, including ageing, grief, and illness. He has conducted numerous projects exploring the meaning of loss in contexts like ageing, grief, and illness. Initially, he studied bereavement in later life and expanded to include terminal and chronic illness, where loss disrupts identity. Recently, Chao has explored resilience, viewing it as a double-edged sword that provides meaning but also heightens awareness of vulnerability and that life will end.

If you have any questions about loss in general, death, dying, grief, ageing, and illness-related loss, he would like to hear from you. Chao has an academic background in comparing different countries, so if you are interested in how loss is perceived and coped with in different societies and cultures, please feel free to get in touch as well!

We’re Vickie Robinson, General Manager and Ryan Palmer Director of Microsoft’s Airband Initiative, working to bring internet access to 250 million people globally by 2025. Ask us anything about how we’re working with governments, nonprofits and internet providers to make this happen. : r/technology](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1gdfgpb/hi_everyone_were_vickie_robinson_general_manager/)

The Internet is a critical part of our daily lives, almost taken for granted thanks to its wide availability. But there are 2.6 BILLION people in the world who remain offline today. Without internet access, we see exacerbated economic inequalities and inhibited access to social services, civic activities, and online learning resources.

Internet access isn’t a luxury, it’s a fundamental right. We lead the work behind Microsoft’s[ Airband Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/airband-initiative?msockid=31d122b3ddc26cf134ae336cdc246dde) to bring together a global network of internet and energy providers, government agencies, nonprofits, and private sector companies to close the digital divide.

We’re aiming to connect 250 million people globally by 2025, focusing particularly on rural areas where internet access is limited -- and that requires big investments in infrastructure. In the United States, for example, our internet service provider partners have received more than $725 million in government infrastructure funding awards to expand networks and drive broadband adoption, with approximately 80% going to rural communities.

We also recently refreshed our [Digital Equity Dashboard](https://msit.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMmUyMzY2YjUtNDdmMS00ZTYyLThhMDAtMTUxMmZmNTcxMGE0IiwidCI6IjcyZjk4OGJmLTg2ZjEtNDFhZi05MWFiLTJkN2NkMDExZGI0NyIsImMiOjV9), which combines government and private sector data to help understand where there are broadband gaps in the United States – right down to the census block level. We want to provide transparent data to everyone and help policymakers make & maximize investments in areas of highest need. If you’re curious about how your town compares to your neighbor’s, take a look!  

A little bit about us! Before I (Vickie) began working at Microsoft, I spent nearly 20 years at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). I was most recently the acting CEO of the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), the organization designated by the FCC to administer the Universal Service Fund (USF), which subsidizes broadband network expansions and provides discounts to low-income consumers.  

I (Ryan) also came from the FCC where I led the Telecommunications Access Policy Division, the division at the FCC responsible for developing policies for administration and oversight of the Universal Service Fund programs.

IAmA,"Hi, I’m Shanice, a PhD student at the University of Bristol researching how age and ethnicity affect type 1 diabetes. Ask Me Anything!"," I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who viewed my post and asked me about type 1 diabetes, why I decided to do my PhD project and shared their experience with diabetes.  I hope you all have a lovely weekend. Best wishes, Shanice 

I’m a third-year health sciences PhD student at the University of Bristol. I am looking at how age and ethnicity may influence type 1 diabetes. I’m particularly interested in how people from diverse ethnicities have been excluded from diabetes research. 

Our bodies need insulin to help to change the glucose (sugar) in our food to energy. People living with type 1 diabetes do not make enough insulin, which makes them feel unwell and exhausted. Today we treat Type 1 Diabetes with insulin injections to help people have more energy. About 1 in 200 people in the UK are living with type 1 diabetes, that’s over 300,000 people! 

Most research on type 1 diabetes has focused on White Northern European Children and our knowledge of type 1 diabetes in adults and people from other cultures is limited despite the increasing number of adults and people from other cultures living with it. Type 1 was previously known as a childhood disease. However, over 50% of new cases are identified in adults. Many adults are misdiagnosed with type 2 diabetes as ageing is a known risk for the condition.  

Studies suggest that children have a more severe form of type 1 diabetes and adults might have a milder form that develops slowly. Few studies have focused on adults with type 1 diabetes, so we do not know much about the development of type 1 diabetes in adults.  

Ethnically diverse people with type 1 diabetes have a more significant risk of developing severe complications. Also, there is a little understanding of the genetic factors that are associated with type 1 diabetes and people from other cultures. Unfortunately, multiple studies have revealed that people from ethnic backgrounds feel excluded, as their cultural beliefs, religion and lived experiences are not considered in research studies. Several studies have reported that their research participants’ experience with diabetes was influenced by their gender and ethnicity. Type 1 diabetes can affect anyone at any age and from any cultural and social background, so it is crucial that research reflects people from all walks of life.  

I am dedicated to ensuring that our research represents all people with type 1 diabetes, no matter their age or ethnicity.  

I am happy to answer any questions you have about type 1 diabetes, ethnicity and research or general questions about studying a PhD. Please feel free to ask me anything!

Thank you again for talking with me!*

Hi everyone, my name is Shoshana Walter and [I’m an investigative reporter](https://www.themarshallproject.org/staff/shoshana-walter?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tmp-reddit) for The Marshall Project. My recent investigation (co-published with Reveal, Mother Jones and USA Today) found that hospitals across the U.S. are reporting pregnant patients to child protective services [based on false positive drug tests](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/09/09/drug-test-pregnancy-pennsylvania-california?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tmp-reddit).

I found 50 mothers in 22 states who faced reports and investigations over positive drug tests that were likely wrong. Women tested positive after eating common foods or taking over-the-counter medications. For example ⬇️

[A short list of how common foods & products can show up as false positives on these drug tests](https://preview.redd.it/kf0nlzrd8qwd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=073b78f5dfd36b338258e4c13c642b343347c919)

One woman in California had her newborn removed for two weeks after testing positive for opiates from a Costco salad. A married couple in Pennsylvania was escorted out of the hospital by police, and threatened with arrest, after she tested positive for meth due to her prescription medication. Another woman was told to “buck up, get a backbone, and stop crying,” by a hearing officer after her newborn was removed due to a false positive result. It took three months to get her newborn back from foster care. (You can hear from the women in [my audio episode with Reveal](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/09/07/drug-test-hospital-pregnancy?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tmp-reddit), or r[ead more in my print story](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/09/09/drug-test-pregnancy-pennsylvania-california?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tmp-reddit).)

This is happening because hospitals typically use pee-in-a-cup tests that are fast and cheap, but have false positive rates as **high as 50 percent**. Hospitals are then reporting these results to child welfare agencies to comply with state and federal laws. But after reviewing laws and policies in every state, I found that **not a single state requires hospitals to actually confirm test results before reporting them**. These policies are funneling thousands of families every year into the child welfare system — forcing them to go through the pain and heartache of a child welfare investigation — even when they have not used any illicit drugs.

That lack of protections is striking in comparison to workplace drug testing regulations, which give many workers confirmation tests and a review from a specially trained doctor who knows how to interpret the results. For workers, these safeguards have existed for decades. In the ‘90s, a federal committee actually recommended that these same protections be put in place for pregnant patients. But that advice was ignored. 

Many of these hospitals have blanket policies of drug testing every patient who comes in to give birth, often without patients' consent — [a policy that has been called discriminatory](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/10/05/pregnancy-drug-test-new-jersey?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tmp-reddit) and a [violation of civil rights](https://www.njspotlightnews.org/2024/09/nj-attorney-general-sues-virtua-hospital-system-drug-testing-pregnant-patients-without-consent/) by civil rights groups and the attorneys general of New York and New Jersey. Attorneys are now looking to file lawsuits against hospitals to change their practices, and some groups are lobbying Congress to change federal law to eliminate the requirement that hospitals notify child welfare authorities anytime a baby is born substance-exposed. But even if federal law changes, little is likely to happen unless states follow suit.

Are you pregnant, know someone who is, has been or will be? Did you think this problem only existed in [a Seinfeld episode](https://youtu.be/mYzuQr7YVYg?si=HTfBB7E9Jp4ZHz5z&t=30)? What would you like to know about these tests, policies and what I found?

Ask me anything!

I'm Lewis Sage-Passant; a researcher in the field of intelligence and espionage with a PhD from Loughborough University in intelligence studies. As well as being an adjunct professor in intelligence at Sciences Po Paris, I'm the Global Head of Intelligence at one of the world's largest companies. In this role, I look at how security threats ranging from macro geopolitical risks, conflict derived supply chain disruptions, and economic espionage activities impact the company.

I've spent my career in a variety of geopolitical analysis and intelligence roles, supporting the energy industry, the financial sector, leading technology firms, and the pharmaceuticals sector, living and working in the Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Europe. I occasionally make talking head appearances in various media outlets, including the BBC, France24, CNBC, Harvard Business Review, The New Arab, El Mundo, and GQ (the coolest one by far!), discussing intelligence, geopolitics, and security topics.

I also founded the geopolitics blog [Encyclopedia Geopolitica](https://encyclopediageopolitica.com/), which this subreddit has been so fantastic in supporting over the years! I host the site's ""[How to get on a Watchlist](https://encyclopediageopolitica.com/how-to-get-on-a-watchlist/)"" podcast, which interviews various experts about dangerous activities. Season 3 will be launching in the coming weeks!

Most recently, I wrote “[Beyond States and Spies: The Security Intelligence Services of the Private Sector](https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/book-beyond-states-and-spies.html)“, which comes out from Edinburgh University Press next week and explores how corporations use intelligence to navigate geopolitics, counter security threats, and shape the world around them.

Thank you to the mods for inviting me to do this AMA. I would be delighted to answer your questions on intelligence, geopolitics, careers in the field, and in particular, how corporations approach geopolitical risk!

IAmA,I’m Mara Hvistendahl at The New York Times. My colleague Joy Dong and I investigated how China’s panda program with U.S. zoos has faltered in its goal of saving a threatened species. We found that pandas have been aggressively bred and removed from the wild for their genes.  AMA!,"Proof: [https://imgur.com/a/FVjVU27](https://imgur.com/a/FVjVU27) 

Hi everybody!  

Two pandas arrived at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington last week, in a new round of panda diplomacy from China. American panda exchanges are overseen by federal regulators and aimed at protecting a threatened species. But our [investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/15/world/asia/pandas-zoo-breeding-death-captivity.html?unlocked_article_code=1.SU4.4yFW.9AJ9u6nLlm_E&smid=re-nytimes), which is based on more than 10,000 pages of documents, photos, and videos, shows how the program has failed to meet many of its goals. Zoos see pandas, and particularly panda cubs, as ways to boost visitor numbers and merchandise sales, while pushing artificial breeding techniques that have hurt and even killed animals.

Zoos pay around $1.1 million a year to rent pairs of pandas. Their Chinese partners are  supposed to use the money to protect pandas’ habitat, with the eventual goal of releasing pandas in the wild. In fact, we found, more pandas have been removed from the wild in western China over the past few decades than have been released. 

In a second story, we explained how the count of pandas in the wild is [a mystery](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/world/asia/panda-census-china-national-zoo-data.html?unlocked_article_code=1.TE4.1aEq.npJV3uewz9QG&smid=re-nytimes). The Chinese government counts pandas using a methodology that is widely seen as flawed, then keeps the data shrouded in secrecy. And in a third story, we looked at [increasingly restrictive panda contracts](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/world/asia/panda-rental-contracts.html?unlocked_article_code=1.TU4.oBF0.s3u73_kY_Jwt&smid=url-share&smid=re-nytimes). Even panda cams are now strictly controlled.

I am an investigative reporter with The Times focused on Asia and the author of two books, *Unnatural Selection* and *The Scientist and the Spy*. Before joining The Times, I was a science reporter based in China, where I occasionally covered pandas. Years ago, I heard about abuses and tried to confirm them. Only recently did I realize that I could get detailed documents on the panda program from the United States.

I typically spend months working on stories, amassing documents and interviewing dozens of sources. Here are links to other projects I’ve worked on:

I am a dues-paying union member, a child of immigrants, and a civil servant. I have spent the last five years at the State Housing Department, where I planned for over a quarter million homes across California, and had the pleasure of reviewing Oakland’s housing element, the 8-year housing plan where they would outline their plan to accommodate nearly 30,000 new homes. As part of this work, I :

* Founded a $100 million grant program to finance affordable backyard homes
* Got the Rockridge neighborhood desegregated to accommodate an additional 5,000 mixed-income homes
* Launched the Prohousing Designation program, where I advocated to include menu items that rewarded Cities for advancing Vision Zero, protecting bike lanes, and planning Bus Rapid Transit Routes

I care deeply about building affordable infill housing, as well as planning more mobility lanes for bikes, scooters and wheelchairs. I have concrete plans to streamline the approval of these mobility lanes, target tree canopy and other capital improvement programs to areas of disinvestment, and legalize neighborhood markets on Day One so that Oaklanders have more commercial options that do not require a car trip.

IAmA,I’m an Independent Candidate Running for U.S. Congress from Indiana’s 5th District. I’ve Been a Redditor for Over 18 Years. AMA!,"Hey Reddit!

**EDIT: I've been on for six hours and have made 150+ comments, so I'm taking a break.**

**Lessons learned so far:**

* Just because people snark to me doesn't mean I should snark back. So I'll try being more respectful for future answers.
* I need to answer more concisely.

I’m Robby Slaughter, an independent candidate running for the U.S. House of Representatives from Indiana’s 5th district (Hamilton, Tipton, Howard, Madison, Grant, and Delaware counties). I’ve been a part of the Reddit community for over 18 years, and now I’m stepping up to represent my community in Congress.

After gathering over 6,000 signatures, I’ve secured a spot on the ballot as an independent—no party affiliations, just a commitment to working for the people of Indiana. I believe in accountability, transparency, and putting the needs of constituents above partisan politics. I am also not taking any corporate donations.

I have an extensive website at [https://robbyslaughter.com](https://robbyslaughter.com) with tons of articles, blog posts, and videos.

Feel free to ask me anything—about this campaign, my platform, my experience as an independent candidate, or what it's like to run for office without the backing of a major party. I’m excited to have a conversation about what you think is important for our district and our country.

That’s also a main reason for why I do it, to teach people about the war, the uniforms, the equipment etc of different nations.

IAmA,I’ve been hand-delivering aid directly to civilians and soldiers on the front lines in Ukraine. AMA!,"

Edit: Thank you all very much for your kind words, interesting questions, and incredibly generous donations! 

I’m currently packing up an SUV and trailer, to take on another trip to Ukraine in the next few days, with 15 boxes of aid. [Thank you all for your generous contributions and for helping to make this possible!](https://gofund.me/a48633da)

I will continue to try and answer all of your brilliant questions as they keep coming in (although for safety reasons I use a dumb-phone in Ukraine, so there will be periods time where I don’t have access to Reddit)



Hi Reddit!

My name is David. Since March 2022, I’ve made multiple trips from England into Ukraine, driving into some of the hardest-hit areas to deliver aid directly to the people who need it most.

From small frontline villages to towns that larger aid organisations can’t always reach, I’ve been taking supplies like food, medical kits, and warm clothing straight into the hands of those enduring the worst of this conflict.

I’ve traveled to places like Chasiv Yar near Bakhmut, where civilians are living without electricity, running water, or basic medical care, and where the shelling never really stops.

I’ve met people who have lost everything but still find a way to carry on, and soldiers who are holding the line with whatever they can get.

My next trip includes an SUV generously donated by a local farmer, which I’ve filling with comfort boxes, first aid kits, and other essentials to help both civilians and soldiers face another bitter winter. Once the supplies are delivered, I plan to pass the vehicle on to the Ukrainian army to contribute to their ongoing operations.

Every trip is funded by donations, which go directly into purchasing these supplies and keeping them moving. I’m not part of any official organisation, just someone who believes that when people are in desperate need, you do what you can to help.

I’m here to share my experiences from the front lines, answer any questions about delivering aid in conflict zones, and talk about the people who, despite everything, haven’t given up hope.

IAmA,IamA self-taught user of a few languages that makes a living where I live in Korea creating content to learn them. AMA!,"Proof: https://imgur.com/a/bBvEZCR

I'm a Canadian who has lived in Korea for about two decades. I've always enjoyed teaching myself new things (languages in particular) and then once I get good enough I always  find myself fired up to create content to make the process easier for others. I eventually got around to learning [how to program in a language called Rust](https://github.com/Dhghomon/programming_at_40) and that's what led to a new career path a few years ago at the age of 40. Before that I was mostly a Korean-English translator and copywriter. Since then I have worked as a Rust developer for a fintech firm, then a database company called EdgeDB (uses a bit of Rust), and now I work at a database company called SurrealDB (built entirely in Rust).

Some recent examples:

* [Aeon's Surreal Renaissance](https://surrealdb.com/learn/book): a book that follows a futuristic/medieval story in which you use the database SurrealDB to (try to?) rebuild civilization. (Released yesterday!)
* [Learn Rust in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-rust-in-a-month-of-lunches): a book for absolute beginners to learn the Rust programming language. Released in January this year.
* [Easy EdgeDB](https://docs.edgedb.com/easy-edgedb): a book that follows the story of Bram Stoker's Dracula to learn the database EdgeDB. Released in 2021, I think it was.
* [Salute, Jonathan!](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Salute,_Jonathan!): a book written entirely in the auxiliary language [Occidental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingue) (AKA Interlingue) that ends up as a full translation of Bram Stoker's Dracula. This was the first Dracula-themed book I made. Released in 2019, I think
* Interlinear translations of Hermann Hesse's [Demian](https://www.lulu.com/shop/hermann-hesse-and-david-macleod/demian-an-interlinear-translation/paperback/product-20351542.html) and [Kinderseele](https://www.lulu.com/shop/hermann-hesse-and-david-macleod/kinderseele-an-interlinear-translation/paperback/product-21280558.html), released in the 2010s. An interlinear translation is one that shows the original text along with a direct-as-possible translation on the line above or below. You see them a lot [in religious texts](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/1-33.htm) but they were popular around the early 20th century as well for language learning and IMO are an invaluable resource.

I'm still bad at design so the nicely designed books (the database ones) are entirely thanks to others - I only wrote the content. The badly designed books are all thanks to me.

I'm most excited about Aeon's Surreal Renaissance that was released just yesterday, but feel free to ask about anything else! Life in Korea, how best to learn a language or anything else. I also have [a post here](http://mithridates.blogspot.com/2013/02/how-i-learned-korean.html) from a while back on how I learned Korean back in 2001.",0,0.43,13,Dhghomon,2024-10-16 01:15:39,1g4ssku,13,High

Over nine years ago I left my home in New Jersey to embark on a twenty-eight thousand-mile, seven-year, walk around the world. After four months of walking, I adopted a dog, [Savannah](https://www.instagram.com/p/CREGmyQLXcI/), and together we covered 25,000 miles across thirty-five countries.

Two years ago [we finished](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/this-man-and-his-dog-spent-seven-years-walking-around-the-world/index.html) our adventure. I’m now the tenth person to walk around the world and Savannah is the first dog. Transitioning from the walk into a more sedentary life has been a challenge. I felt my days shift from packed with experiences to utterly empty, I fell into a depression, then lost Savannah to kidney failure. (CNN recently wrote [an article](https://www.cnn.com/travel/seven-years-walking-around-world-dog-tom-turcich/index.html) about all this.)

Though these past two years haven’t been easy, what’s given order to my days has been working on my memoir. [This book](https://www.amazon.com/World-Walk-Seven-Search-Meaning/dp/1510779019/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2GTX65425MI6A&keywords=The+world+Walk+Tom+Turcich&qid=1707346807&sprefix=the+world+walk+tom+turcich,aps,116&sr=8-1), which should be available at your local bookstore, was released a few days ago. *The World Walk* explores the breadth of my development from naive suburbanite to world traveler. It dives into my profound relationship with Savannah. And it hopefully gives the reader a good adventure story and a greater understanding of the world.

My motivation to walk around the world was to make the most of my time here. When my friend AnnMarie died at sixteen, her passing impressed on me the brevity of life. After that, I discovered [Karl Bushby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Bushby), and the idea of walking around the world latched onto me. Over the next eight years, I went to school, lived at home, worked, saved, and paid off loans until I could begin the walk the day before I turned twenty-six.

During the first two years of my adventure, I walked from New Jersey to Uruguay. I was held up at knifepoint in Panama, did ayahuasca in the Amazon, and climbed 15,000 feet over the Chilean Andes. Those were incredibly clarifying years. The endless hours of walking allowed me to reach a profound acceptance of my life, my choices, and my idiosyncrasies. You can read or listen to an excerpt about that section on [AFAR](https://www.afar.com/podcasts/travel-tales/s5-e12-benefits-of-walking).

During the three years after The Americas, I was [almost taken out](https://www.facebook.com/TheWorldWalk/photos/a.382245018625792/870555439794745/?type=3&theater) by a bacterial infection, needed months to recover, then walked Europe, North Africa, across Turkey, and into Azerbaijan.

I peregrinated The Camino in Spain, had a twenty-four-hour police escort through Algeria, visited the village of my family name (Turčić) in Croatia (you can read an excerpt from the book about this section [here](https://sjmagazine.net/people/a-few-stories-to-tell)), and became the first private citizen granted permission to cross the Bosphorus Bridge on foot. These years nurtured an appreciation for how history, geography, and circumstance affect people far more than willpower.

After getting caught in a covid lockdown in Azerbaijan, my walking became more bureaucratic. My planned route from Kazakhstan to Mongolia, then down the coast of Australia, became impossible due to border closures. I made due by walking more of Turkey while waiting for the world to reopen, then crossing Uzbekistan and the [mountains of Kyrgyzstan](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRJvzx1rlT7/). By the time I finished walking Kyrgyzstan, much of the world remained closed, so Savannah and I flew to Seattle and began the last leg of our journey; a thirty-five hundred-mile walk back home to New Jersey. Strangely enough, the walk across my home country proved to be one of the most difficult sections of my journey. With the end in sight, I needed every ounce of effort to finish (also, I [walked Wyoming](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWRwRCvL4Jc/?img_index=1) in November…not something I would recommend).

So there it is - a summary of my life. Whether you’ve read [the book](https://www.amazon.com/World-Walk-Seven-Search-Meaning/dp/1510779019/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2GTX65425MI6A&keywords=The+world+Walk+Tom+Turcich&qid=1707346807&sprefix=the+world+walk+tom+turcich,aps,116&sr=8-1) already and have specific questions about it, or whether this is the first hearing my story and you’re curious about the logistics, I’ll do my best to answer every question as thoroughly as I can!

Hey Reddit! I post on here really often and I know a lot of you who frequent the comedy subs have at least seen my face!

I’m doing my first national tour with my brother u/wyatt1710 (Wyatt Feegrado) and a lot of people ask me how I got into standup, why we have different last names, what it is like doing standup at my age, and more, so I thought I’d make this AMA!

10/19 SAN FRANCISCO, CA
11/2 LAS VEGAS, CA
11/9 SEATTLE, WA
11/10 PORTLAND, OR

IAmA,I've been blind since birth. I test software and documents to make sure other blind people can use them successfully. I live alone and have traveled to other countries and continents solo. AMA!,"EDIT: I'm having a lot of fun answering questions. I'm taking breaks but will be actively monitoring this AMA indefinitely, and hopefully responding quickly. Please feel free to keep commenting.

Hi, I'm u/SLJ7. \([proof](https://reddit.com/r/u_SLJ7/comments/1fz7h1r/i_am_the_op_on_this_blindness_ama/)\)

I know this has been done before, but I haven't seen one for a while, and with October being blindness awareness month, I thought I'd do my own version of this.

Before anyone asks, yes I'm writing this (on an ordinary keyboard, which surprises people for some reason), and reading all comments that come in using text-to-speech. I run it many times faster than human speech and have keyboard commands and screen gestures to quickly navigate between comments and threads, so it’s not anywhere near as inefficient as it sounds.

I attended a training centre that helps blind people learn how to travel, cook, and generally live life independently. Here’s a [Denver Post article](https://www.denverpost.com/2011/10/17/rtds-planned-changes-affect-blind-students-who-use-system-for-transit-training/) from then which mentions me (Simon) by name.

I use technology A LOT to help me, and am also just a technology enthusiast with lots of gadgets lying around. My phone can read my mail, scan barcodes, and give me real time walking directions. I recently bought the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses, which allow me to ask Meta AI to describe what I’m (not) seeing, or video call with someone and show them my surroundings hands-free.

I take the phrase “AMA” literally. If I’m not comfortable answering something for some reason, I’ll still reply.

To those who don’t necessarily have a question but would like to know more about the lives of blind people on Reddit: r/blind is alive and well. I believe they have rules against posting questions, but you will find lots of existing and ongoing discussions there.

To other blind people reading this: If you’d like to add something in the comments, feel free; but please specify that you are not OP, just to avoid confusion.",817,0.93,252,blindama,2024-10-08 13:51:20,1fz7fkv,1069,High
IAmA,"We’re Marcus Carter and Ben Egliston, authors of “Fantasies of Virtual Reality”, an open-access book about the promises and pitfalls of Virtual Reality. AMA! ","Hello! We’re Marcus Carter and Ben Egliston, academics at The University of Sydney. We’ve just published [Fantasies of Virtual Reality: Untangling Fiction, Fact, and Threat](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262549165/fantasies-of-virtual-reality/) with The MIT Press, a critical account of Virtual Reality; its overhyped expectations; its harmful configurations in the present; and how VR could be built better for all.

VR is one of the most data-hungry digital sensors we’re likely to invite into our lives in the next decade, with enormous potential for exclusion, manipulation, and harm. Our book is organized around the most pervasive and central fantasies that developers and investors have for VR: in [gaming](https://spectrum.ieee.org/vr-games) and filmmaking, for surveillance, for violence, and for data collection.

In comparison to other widely analyzed and critiqued emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) or crypto, VR is rarely discussed. Our aim is to help others understand VR’s promises and pitfalls, and to offer a path for anticipating, addressing, and preventing the challenges of this technology before it becomes entrenched.

Thanks to MIT Press’ Direct to Open program, the whole book is available to read for free [here](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/5824/Fantasies-of-Virtual-RealityUntangling-Fiction). You can also buy a paperback or eBook from any good bookstore!

We’ve also written about a wide range of topics at the intersection of game studies, media studies and human-computer interaction. Ben’s PhD was on Dota 2 eSports; Marcus’s was on EVE Online. Our next VR project focuses on Disability and Virtual Reality. You can find links to all our research on our staff profiles ([Ben](https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/about/our-people/academic-staff/benjamin-egliston.html) & [Marcus](https://www.sydney.edu.au/architecture/about/our-people/academic-staff/marcus-carter.html)), including Marcus’ other MIT Press books [Treacherous Play](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046312/treacherous-play/) and [Fifty Years of Dungeons and Dragons](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262547604/fifty-years-of-idungeons-and-dragonsi/).

IAmA,I am a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University who teaches software engineers to communicate more effectively… ask me anything!,"Nick Frollini is a member of the **Software and Societal Systems Department** faculty in the School of Computer Science at **Carnegie Mellon University**.  He teaches courses that cover communications, negotiation, and leadership at the graduate level for the [Master of Software Engineering program.](https://mse.s3d.cmu.edu/)

A reformed (and generally lousy) programmer, Nick spent the dotcom era as a corporate banker and venture capitalist, before moving into higher education where he held a number of operational leadership roles prior to joining the CMU faculty full-time in 2021. Throughout his career, he has witnessed countless presentations, most of which were terrible (and that's being kind). As a result, he’s dedicated his professional life to training a new generation of technical leaders who can communicate (and present) far more effectively than the one which preceded it.

Outside of teaching, Nick mentors early-stage companies and occasionally dabbles in film production and political activism. Ask him anything about tech, communication, leadership, or what it's like teaching in the Master of Software Engineering program at CMU. Nick will be using this account created by MSE programming staff to answer questions during the AMA.

**EDIT:** Nick will be going **LIVE** with answering questions **this Wednesday, October 9th at 2pm EST.** Hit the reminder button below the post to be notified. Thank you for the early questions!

***EDIT 2:*** *Nick here. I'm looking forward to answering questions in about an hour... This is our first time hosting an AMA as a program and it's definitely my first time as a participant. It does, indeed, seem that we didn't set this up correctly in terms of timing or voice with the OP, and for that I apologize. We'll take it as a learning experience and aim to have smoother sailing next time. For the avoidance of doubt, I'll end all of my responses with my initials (""NRF"") since I'm participating in this AMA via the program's account. If it doesn't have my initials, it wasn't from me. Thanks for the early questions -- and for those that will come in while this is live -- I'll do my best to answer as many of them as I can... Please note that my responses are my own and don't necessarily represent the views of the university, the department, or the program. Thanks! -NRF*

***EDIT 3:*** *This has been a great deal of fun. I have to go and prep for my evening class, so I'm going to end the live portion of the AMA, but will try to find time to respond to some of the questions I didn't get to. Please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn if I can provide any additional insights into the area or, in particular, our graduate programs. Thanks again! -NRF*

IAmA,Don't Fear the umlaut! Ask us anything about 'German-speaking' wines ,"\[UPDATE: Yawn! Time for bed, I'll try to hit a few more tomorrow! Thanks for all the fantastic questions! (PRS)\]

Hi Reddit! 

We are Paula and Valerie of TRINK MAGAZINE (https://trinkmag.com). We do English-language news and deep dives into ‘umlaut wine’ from the German-speaking world (Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Alto-Adige in Italy). We’ve seen a lot of curiosity on reddit about these wines and producers but not enough clear answers.

Paula recently attended both the German and Austrian previews for the upcoming vintage release. After 8 days of tasting at industry-only events in Wiesbaden and Grafenegg, she’s got a notebook full of tea to spill. Trends, regions, big personalities, frost and floods, it’s all in there.

Got questions about umlaut wines in general? Or about the state of wine journalism and starting up a (woman-led) wine magazine? Or TRINK’s unusual origin story -- because of COVID, the two founders ran the magazine together for almost 2 years before actually meeting in person for the first time? Fire away and AUA!

Quick bios: Paula is an American-born writer who has been living in Germany for over two decades. She is a certified sommelière (IHK and COMS) with an MFA in Creative Writing as well. She also serves as the Germany correspondent for [jancisrobinson.com](http://jancisrobinson.com), with bylines in a wide variety of German and English-language publications.

Valerie is based in the US and has been writing about wine for the better part of the past decade. Her work appears in the pages of Noble Rot, Full Pour, SevenFifty Daily, Meininger’s Wine Business International, Pipette, Glug, Pellicle, among other publications.

Post your questions and we'll start answering around 4 pm Eastern.

I’m [Erin Quinn-Kong](https://www.erinquinnkong.com/), and I’ve been a magazine editor at *Allure*, *Us Weekly*, *Austin Monthly*, and now *Texas Highways*. My debut novel [Hate Follow](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/hate-follow-erin-quinn-kong?variant=41390410072098), about an influencer who is sued by her teen daughter for invasion, comes out TODAY!

Some fun facts about me: 

-I first wrote about bloggers/influencers in 2009 for *Self* and have followed them ever since. 

-I edited the Beyoncé/Jay Z wedding cover story at *Us Weekly*, and I was at *Us* during Britney’s breakdown. (I have thoughts). 

-I live in Austin, TX, with my husband and our two children. 

-I’m well versed in the new legislation that has recently been passed in Illinois, Minnesota, and California to protect influencer kids—and I would not be surprised if a kid sues their influencer or vlogger parent one day over their intrusive social media posts.

I’ve been doing AMAs for these “off the street” hiring announcements since 2018, and they always receive a lot of interest.

** The current application window will open from ***October 11 - November 4*** for all eligible U.S. citizens.**

Eligibility requirements are as follows:

- Must be a U.S. citizen

- Must be registered for Selective Service, if applicable (Required for males born after 12/31/1959) 

- Must be age 30 or under on the closing date of the application period (with limited exceptions)

- Must have either **one** year of general work experience or four years of education leading to a bachelor’s degree, or a combination of both

- Must speak English clearly enough to be understood over communications equipment

**- Be willing to relocate to an FAA facility based on agency staffing needs**

[START HERE](https://www.faa.gov/be-atc) to visit the FAA website and read up on the application process and timeline, training, pay, and more. Here you will also find detailed instructions on *how to apply*.

[MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS](https://www.aviationmedicine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Medical-Standards-for-Terminal-and-En-Route-Centers-for-ATC-Positions%C2%A0FAA-Brochure.pdf)

Let’s start with the difficult stuff: 

The hiring process is *incredibly* arduous. After applying, you will have to wait for the FAA to process all applications, determine eligibility, and then reach out to you to schedule the AT-SA. This process typically takes a couple months. The AT-SA is essentially an air traffic aptitude test. The testing window usually lasts another couple months until everyone is tested. Your score will place you into one of several “bands”, the top of which being “Best Qualified.” I don’t have stats, but from my understanding the vast majority of offer letters go to those whose scores fall into that category. 

If you receive and accept an offer letter (called a Tentative Offer Letter, or TOL) you will then have to pass medical and security clearance, including:

- Drug testing

- Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI2)

- Class II medical exam

- Fingerprinting

- Federal background check

Once you clear the medical and security phase you will receive a Final Offer Letter (FOL) with instructions on when/where to attend the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City, OK.

Depending on which track you are assigned (Terminal or En Route), you will be at the academy for 3-4 months (paid). You will have to pass your evaluations at the end in order to continue on to your facility. **There is a 99% chance you will have to relocate.** Your class will get a list of available facilities to choose from based solely on national staffing needs. If you fail your evaluations, your position will be terminated. Once at your facility, on the job training typically lasts anywhere from 1-3 years. You will receive substantial raises as you progress through training. 

**All that being said:**

This is an *incredibly* rewarding career. The median pay for air traffic controllers in 2021 was **$138,556**. We receive extremely competitive benefits and leave, and won’t work a day past 56 (mandatory retirement, **with a pension**). We also get **3 months of paid parental leave**. Most controllers would tell you they can’t imagine doing anything else. Enjoying yourself at work is actively encouraged, as taking down time in between working traffic is paramount for safety.

IAmA,"Hi, I'm Ben and I research how we could give robots a human-like sense of touch. I’m particularly interested in applying this idea to prosthetic hands to make them more for intuitive to users. Ask Me Anything!","Hi Reddit, I'm Ben from the University of Bristol.

 I research how we can develop man-made touch sensors that mimic our human sense of touch.

 The touch sensors I research are neuromorphic, which means they mimic the way our brain processes and stores information. This has advantages for robotics in terms of speed and power efficiency and could also give us clues to understand how our own human sense of touch works.

 Ultimately, I believe that a human-like sense of touch in robots is a step towards the merging of technology with biology and will lead to safer and more intuitive prosthetic devices. These could help prosthesis users to manipulate objects more effectively and rely less on vision when using their prosthetic limb. The development of such devices also opens up interesting ethical questions, such as whether an artificial sense of pain should be included if we’re attempting to fully recreate human sensation.

 I'd love to answer questions on touch, neuromorphic technology or prosthetics. Ask Me Anything!

IAmA,I wrote a book on the death penalty and report on executions for The Marshall Project. Ask me anything.,"Hey everyone, I’m Maurice Chammah, [a staff writer](https://www.themarshallproject.org/staff/maurice-chammah?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tmp-reddit) for The Marshall Project and author of “Let the Lord Sort Them: The Rise and Fall of the Death Penalty.” 

This feels like a major moment for executions in America. You’ve probably seen the innocence claims of [Marcellus “Khaliifah” Williams](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/24/missouri-executes-marcellus-williams) and [Robert Roberson](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/09/18/texas-autism-death-penalty-roberson?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tmp-reddit). 

But that’s the tip of the iceberg: Alabama is starting to [execute people with nitrogen gas](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2024/02/19/alabama-execution-nitrogen-gas-witness-cruel-torture/72616304007/), and South Carolina may soon schedule a [firing squad execution](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/04/08/the-return-of-the-firing-squad?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tmp-reddit), the first since 2010 (and the first in a century outside of Utah). Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump is talking about his [desire to execute drug dealers](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/04/22/florida-trump-desantis-death-penalty-politics?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tmp-reddit) and ""Haul out the Guillotine!” in a recent fundraising email. The authors of Project 2025 — the policy plan that Trump disavows but was written by his supporters — plots out a potentially [huge expansion for the American death penalty](https://theintercept.com/2024/06/21/project-2025-death-penalty-supreme-court-kennedy/). 

President Joe Biden used to talk about working to end the death penalty at both the state and federal level, but the topic disappeared from the Democratic party platform this year, even as more [Americans than ever express discomfort with executions in polls](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1606/death-penalty.aspx). There are some things Biden could do before he leaves office in order to make it harder for Trump to carry out another execution spree, as he did before leaving office in 2020. 

I’ve been covering all of these political dynamics, Supreme Court developments and individual cases for more than a decade. I’ve watched trials and interviewed men in their final hours. I’ve studied the history of the death penalty going [back to the 1970s, when it nearly disappeared but then came back with a vengeance](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/01/26/the-case-that-made-texas-the-death-penalty-capital?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tmp-reddit).

I’m Silas, the Innovation Manager at SWK Novartec, part of the Stadtwerke Karlsruhe, and I wanted to share my experience with volunteering and hear your thoughts on it!

It all started with a post in our company intranet seeking interview partners for volunteer work. Admittedly, I initially didn't feel the call to action, as the image depicted was of elderly care, a field I don't engage with. However, I took a moment to reflect and realized I have been volunteering since 2014 with a nonprofit called www.ArbeiterKind.de, which supports young people pursuing higher education without familial guidance. Coming from a similar background, I find it fulfilling to guide those in need of someone who understands their struggles.

Additionally, during a challenging year of unemployment in 2019, I volunteered at the Beiertheimer Tafel. There, I learned about the importance of community and support, while helping distribute food to those in need. It was a meaningful experience that connected me with incredible people.

Currently, I also serve as a mentor for startups through Cyberforum and the Axel Accelerator. It’s rewarding to share my experiences and provide guidance to emerging entrepreneurs.

I’d love to know what you think about my volunteer work! Does it count? Am I doing enough? What are your volunteering experiences? I’m eager to hear your opinions and stories!

Looking forward to your responses!

Best,

Hi, Reddit. About a year ago, we found out that a key group of January 6 supporters were living in a house in our neighborhood. One was Micki Witthoeft, the mother of Ashli Babbitt, who was killed in the Capitol building on January 6. Another is the wife of the first person sentenced after standing trial for crimes related to January 6. We could have kept our distance. But instead we got to know them and ended up deep inside their alternate world, one where January 6 was a day when martyrs were made and people wound up unfairly imprisoned. We also got to know their grief, their love for one another, their hobbies, their pets. 

We figured that if January 6 is not over for some, we should talk with those people who are still living it. In our new podcast series [We Live Here Now](https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2024/08/introducing-we-live-here-now/679632/), we report on our neighbors and the experience of getting to know them.

* keynoted dating industry conferences in which I've been propositioned by escorts, shady CEOs, and offshore tax haven sales reps
* written white papers about topics like AI, content moderation, and communication tools
* interviewed OkCupid's former CTO about their matching algorithm on my podcast (fun fact: he's presently CTO at Grindr!) 
* designed intimate, meaningful dates that helped people develop deeper relationships, and hosted hundreds of events tied to friendship, intimacy, and lifelong learning, my favorite of which was a 12-hour love language themed choose-your-own-adventure gathering in Manhattan
* advised dating sites, including OkCupid, Coffee Meets Bagel, and Farmers Only
* coached individuals of all ages, orientations, and relationship preferences through navigating online and offline dating, and matched several people to their future lovers, spouses, friends, cofounders, employees, and roommates

I am a PhD student in the Department of Engineering Mathematics & Technology and the Centre for Ethics in Medicine. I am exploring the ethical and policy side of future cancer nanomedicines. Picture this: tiny, super-smart nanoparticles teaming up with artificial intelligence to take down cancer cells, drawing inspiration from swarm robotics. I am focused on what is good and bad about this technology and how it should be regulated.

Good regulation ensures that emerging health technologies are safe, effective, and accessible, while bad regulation can lead to safety risks, inequality, and ethical issues. My background includes experience in the clinical trials sector, working with decentralized models, that allow participants to engage in clinical trial activities at their chosen location, including at home, using digital tools to enable research without direct contact between researchers and participants. Examples of digital tools include interactive mobile applications, telemedicine to conduct virtual visits and consultations or devices and sensors that monitor patients’ health metrics remotely, such as blood pressure monitors, glucose monitors, and wearable activity trackers. 

The development of digital health technologies such as, online platforms containing patient data, raises ethical dilemmas around privacy, data, security, bias and more. Considering these issues, how should we approach the design of AI-based cancer treatments, and what should clinical trials of these treatments involve? I believe collaborating with affected groups, such as patients and healthcare professionals, in designing health treatments ensures relevance, effectiveness, and patient-centred care. This approach fosters trust, promotes ethical practices, and results in improved health outcomes and satisfaction among patients, families, and healthcare providers. 

I would love to discuss topics on ethics, clinical trials, digital health, and future cancer nanomedicines.

In 2023, we partnered with [The New York Times](https://www.reddit.com/user/thenewyorktimes/) to report a year-long investigation revealing that people in Baltimore have been dying of overdoses [at a rate never before seen](https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/public-health/baltimore-opioid-overdose-capital-ZWBYWMCJ45CGNPCGAMFOE6YDGI/) in a major American city. 

After fighting the city for data (and failing to get it), The Banner [successfully sued the state](https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/politics-power/state-government/judge-orders-state-to-turn-over-autopsy-records-in-banner-lawsuit-DIFLDK2KKRALXDX3M6CQVCQMV4/) of Maryland for autopsy data that showed the true scale of the tragedy. 

The data show that in the past six years, nearly 6,000 lives have been lost. The death rate from 2018 to 2022 was nearly double that of any other large city, and higher than nearly all of Appalachia during the prescription pill crisis, the Midwest during the height of rural meth labs or New York during the crack epidemic.

The fact that the city’s status was so much worse than others was not known to the mayor, the deputy mayor overseeing health or multiple City Council members until we showed them the data we had compiled. [Click here to read that story](https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/public-health/baltimore-opioid-overdose-capital-ZWBYWMCJ45CGNPCGAMFOE6YDGI/) and see what they said.

Our reporting also showed that a generation of older Black men, now in their 50s to 70s, have especially suffered from overdoses, dying at a rate 20x higher than the rest of the country. Nick worked closely with the NY Times' Graphics staff to create charts showing the profound impact on that generation, [which you can see here](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/us/baltimore-opioid-epidemic-seniors-takeaways.html).

We started working with The Times after Alissa applied for a [local investigations fellowship](https://www.nytco.com/careers/local-investigations-fellowship/) run by former NYT Executive Editor Dean Baquet. All three of us worked closely with Times to report this story.

Baltimore recently [won hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/politics-power/local-government/baltimore-gets-80m-in-latest-win-against-opioid-manufacturers-J3ERAHRFFZARTLONNGBMT6OYVM/) in opioid settlement funds as part of an ongoing lawsuit [against large pharmaceutical companie](https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/politics-power/local-government/baltimore-opioid-trial-opening-statements-6V2JBLFB4BC67LBLWUOAIX5RNM/)s, accused of pushing extremely addictive painkillers.

ESPEN:

Hi, I'm Espen Fadnes. For the last 24 years I've been a skydiver, basejumper and wingsuiter. Partly this means I've worked a lot on educating others in how to fly their body, fly their parachute and in general help them be safer. But it also means I've travelled the world flying wingsuits on every continent including Antarctica. Many of these adventures are self driven, through the dream of being a human bird, but, they are also part of larger cooperations with film productions and competitions. 

 Ultimately I'm on a never ending project where the dream is to become the most bird-like human being I can possibly be. Will I ever land without a parachute, can I use the winds to fly forever and where on the planet is the highest place to launch? Adventures starts in our own creativity, and human flight is an area of many unknowns. Do you want to fly?",14,0.65,2,nationalgeographic,2024-09-27 10:10:45,1fqq0hr,16,High

I was an associate for Jones Day in D.C., before joining the [UC Davis law faculty](https://law.ucdavis.edu/people/aaron-tang) where I currently teach about constitutional law, federal courts, and education law. I write frequently about the Supreme Court and published my first book, [*Supreme Hubris: How Overconfidence is Destroying the Court—and How We Can Fix It*—*and How We Can Fix It*](https://www.amazon.com/Supreme-Hubris-Overconfidence-Destroying-Court_and/dp/0300264038), last summer. 

Most recently, I joined PBS as a moderator for the new special, “[DEADLOCK: an election story](https://www.pbs.org/show/deadlock/),” produced by GBH in Boston. I guide a panel of thought leaders (all with very different perspectives) to debate a complex ethical scenario about a very messy election day. SPOILER: I think we can still have nuanced and thoughtful discussions with people we disagree with in 2024.

We've worked at companies in big tech (Meta, Microsoft), climate tech (EnergySavvy/Uplight, Osmo Systems), and startup unicorns (Convoy).

Software engineering has a crucial role to play in climate tech innovation – that's why we created and teach an 8-week course on the topic called Software for Climate, run a climate hackathon, and co-founded Option Zero, our software consultancy for climate companies and initiatives.

At a company called EnergySavvy (now Uplight) we helped ship and measure energy-efficiency retrofits (heat pumps, air sealing, etc etc) on thousands of homes across the US.

At Osmo Systems, we worked on a deep-learning-based water quality sensor for shrimp farming, preventing overnight die-offs that can kill a farmer's entire crop.

With Carbon Yield, we're helping farmers and supply chains adopt regenerative agriculture, keeping more carbon in the ground and using fewer pesticides.

IAmA,"Hi, I’m Alice and I’m an animal behaviour researcher at the University of Bristol. I research how dolphins interact and form relationships with each other. Ask Me Anything!","Hi Reddit, I’m Dr. Alice Bouchard, a researcher at the University of Bristol.

I study animal behaviour, and I am particularly interested in how mammals form long-term social relationships. I am currently looking into relationships between female and male bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia. To do this, I work with a team of researchers to conduct boat-based observations and playback experiments. We use an underwater speaker to play specific sounds to dolphins and record their reactions with a drone. In this population, which has been studied for the past 40 years (https://www.sharkbaydolphins.org/), males form alliances to compete for mates, while females must navigate their relationships with males carefully to balance their need to reproduce and avoid unwanted attention. While we know a lot about how male dolphins cooperate, we know less about how females interact with males.   My research explores whether females prefer to associate with certain males and what drives these preferences. This work will help us better understand the evolution of the social dynamics in this species and how dolphin ‘societies’ work.  

Before joining this project, I completed a PhD on long-term social relationships between wild male chimpanzees, where I studied how they use vocal communication to maintain these bonds. I would be happy to answer any questions about social relationships and social cognition in mammals, as well as the various aspects of fieldwork involved in studies like mine.

IAmA,"I am Or Graur, astrophysicist and author of “Galaxies,” an easy-to-read introduction to the last 2,000 years of galaxy studies. AMA!","Hi, I’m Dr. Or Graur, associate professor of astrophysics at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. [**Photo proof**](https://postimg.cc/2q6g9vjJ). I use telescopes around the world and in space to study supernovae (the explosions of stars) and tidal disruption events (bright flares that erupt when stars are torn apart by supermassive black holes). Two years ago, I published an easy-to-read introduction to supernovae, which you can find through MIT Press [**here**](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262548755/galaxies/).

I had so much fun writing that book that I came back to write a second one, this time on galaxies. This book was also published by MIT Press, and you can find it [**here**](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262548755/galaxies/)**.**

I chose to write a book about galaxies because, to my surprise, there aren’t that many books out there on these fascinating objects. Which is weird, when you consider that galaxies are where most of astrophysics takes place. This is where gas is converted into stars that go on to explode as supernovae, where supermassive black holes launch jets of blinding light, and where at least one planet gave rise to life. Galaxies are not just fascinating in and of themselves; they’re also a tool that we use to study the Universe. Without galaxies in our toolbox, we wouldn’t have discovered dark matter or that the Universe is expanding.

I’d love to answer your questions about:

* The history of galaxy studies and the multicultural mythology of the Milky Way.
* The different types of galaxies we observe: spirals, ellipticals, and irregulars, oh my!
* The intricate relationships between galaxies and their supermassive black holes.
* The formation and evolution of galaxies, from inflation to the cosmic web.
* The Milky Way’s galactic neighborhood and violent interactions with our neighbors.
* Whatever you’d like to know about supernovae and tidal disruption events.
* What it’s like to be an astrophysicist (and what you need to do to become one).
* Any other astrophysics question.

Hey everyone, I’m Shannon Heffernan and [I’m a staff writer](https://www.themarshallproject.org/staff/shannon-heffernan?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tmp-reddit) for [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/about?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tmp-reddit). My recent reporting shows how even if a person doesn’t directly commit a crime, [they can still be sent to prison.](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/06/13/abuse-domestic-violence-survivors-liability-prison?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tmp-reddit) That’s because of some surprising laws that many people don’t know about. 

“Accomplice liability”  laws — which every state has — allow someone to be punished for assisting or supporting another person who commits a crime, in some cases, even if that participation is under the threat of violence. Failure-to-protect laws punish someone if they put their child in a dangerous situation, for example. 

My reporting shows that survivors of domestic and sexualized violence are vulnerable to prosecution because of the control their abusers hold over them. (Here are [my 5 takeaways for a tl;dr](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/08/28/accomplice-liability-laws-what-to-know?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tmp-reddit).)

I reviewed court documents to find where prosecutors charged a person (mostly women) for supporting, taking part in or failing to stop a crime by their alleged abuser. [I found nearly 100 cases, but there are likely many more](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/06/13/abuse-domestic-violence-survivors-liability-prison?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tmp-reddit). For example, I found:

* A woman is in an Oklahoma prison because her boyfriend severely beat her child when she wasn’t at home. Like in other cases, evidence that the woman was herself being abused was used *against* her. Prosecutors argued that because he had previously choked her, she should have known better than to have her child with him.  
* A woman was convicted in federal court for conspiracy to sex traffic a minor in Alaska, despite being 19 and being trafficked by her co-defendant. Court documents said he had recently shot her in the stomach while she was pregnant with his child. She had to register as a sex offender, and her home address was made public, which she said makes her vulnerable to further harassment and threats.

I heard from lawmakers and survivors’ advocates that there are at least two possible ways to tackle this problem. First, change failure-to-protect laws and accomplice liability laws, so there are fewer prosecutions of people who have survived intimate partner violence. Second, pass laws that make it easier for survivors to have their history of abuse considered at sentencing or in resentencing hearings.

For over 15 years, I've reported on abuse and the criminal justice system. Ask me anything.

Government secrecy is a problem — and it’s getting worse. The government has no idea how many secrets it creates every year, if those secrets really need protecting, or how much it costs to protect them.

I have spent over a decade researching and fighting excessive government secrecy. I’ve filed Freedom of Information Act requests with every single federal agency that accepts them, I’ve helped staff on Capitol Hill get information from the agencies they oversee, and I’ve lobbied for changes to how the government handles classified information.

I’m interested in presidential records and libraries, unauthorized destruction of federal agency records, and basically everything that the National Archives and Records Administration does.

I also — briefly — ran a FOIA office for the federal government, so I know what it looks like from the inside.

What do you want to know about government secrets? AMA. I'll begin answering questions at 2 pm EDT.

So my HOA states that holiday decorations can only be up 30 days before and after a holiday. Houses here (including my own) decorate heavily from Halloween onward. This year, many Halloween decorations came down surprisingly quick, but a good chunk still have Halloween stuff up. Some house put up Thanksgiving decor. Think wreaths, fall leaf garland and lawn flags with cute little turkeys. Some houses, are defying HOA rules and put up Christmas decorations inflatable snow men and all. What I am really getting a kick out of though are the houses that have left up Halloween decorations but have added Christmas lights.

CasualConversation,"How's the college experience in your country, culturall?","(I mean culturally in the sense that it might not have been your personal experience but it's a common thing maybe specific to your country, the way not all american students join Greek houses but it's a distinctive trait of their uni experience)

I'm from Portugal! The social aspect is quite mundane, just a lot of drinking beer and smoking an ungodly amount of cigs. The fact that the uni has bars inside with happy hour (all afternoon, every day) is a personal favorite of mine lol! And staying in the library till three am when the first weeks are over (sad lol)

The hazing experience is rather traditional and maybe intense? I don't know how it compares to other countries.

You're assigned randomly to a group of seniors depending on your correspondant degree, and they take you to a bunch of different hazing activities. You can go volunteering, get flour and eggs thrown at you, make to chant rather embarrassing songs in the most touristy street of the city, etc etera. While you're being hazed you choose a godmother or godparent, or both, a senior that you connected with and feel like they can hello you throughout your degree. At the end you're christened by your godparents in a typically filthy lake while they pour beer on you. Different unis have different sets of rules but this is a common retelling. The intensity of the hazing depends on sheer luck (some seniors don't let you look them in the eyes for days and make you do burpees for being late; mine grew tired of pretending to be mean after about two hours). 

Parties are organized by the student body, and are done inside the university. You almost always need to buy a ticket to attend. The bigger unis have festival like organization, different stages, mainstream national artists, etc. Smaller parties that aren't either in the begging or end of the semester are usually attended only by the students of said uni and it's done inside the building itself or on the patios, but there's always security 

The most distinct thing would have to be the academic robes, think harry potter capes, and underneath office attire (tie, white button up, black trousers for guys and knee length pencil skirts and black collants for girls). The seniors have to use them during hazing activities and can wear them everyday but it's frankly tiredsome lol (along with rules like you can't wear makeup while wearing your robes and they come with equally traditional uncomfortable shoes).

The hazing is pretty divisive here. A lot of people share the opinion that it's hierarchical bullshit made for people who need to humiliate others, others think it's a detrimental part of your college life. A few years ago students dled in a hazing activity in the beach at night and it rightfully angered a lot of people

This curiosity came from a post I saw where OP said that their college experience was purely academic; you went to classes and went back home, and that piqued my curiosity in how people from other places experience this part of their lives!",5,0.86,3,strawberryc0w_,2024-11-13 20:05:53,1gqu3yz,8,High
CasualConversation,I’m lost and confused ,"So I (M27) have been moved away from my hometown for almost five years to the day. 

I took a job in news in a small town and have since bounced around to a couple of bigger markets to get more exposure and grow my craft - the usual thing that happens in media.

My job right now is good and I’m overall content with it, but I’m not satisfied as I want to move home soon and work for a station so that I’m close to my family and friends. 

There’s one problem though….. the jobs in the industry have dried up. Multiple companies have made major cuts over the past five years. It’s gotten to the point where I’m too scared to apply for a job back home because I fear I’m going to be laid off within months of potentially being hired. All of the talent that was there has pretty much left and gone to communications jobs. 

The company I work for now has stable work and will likely be around for a while - but like I said I want to do bigger and better things and where I am is not that. 

I feel like I’m stuck. If it’s not for news than what do I do? I don’t have a degree in anything else and I want to do something I like and not hate. 

Where do I go from here? I’m scared to think what could come next and am horrified to take a risk.

Hasn't been below 65 since March and now suddenly it's in the 40s. All that dust burning off of heaters all at once all over town. It smells wonderful. Putting me in a Christmas sort of mood.

One of my other favorites is that smell when you snap a ripe tomato off the vine. I wish it wasn't so fleeting.

Rain on hot pavement is up there too. As is pool water on hot pavement, which is very very different from rain.

The mall used to be one of my favorite smells, but malls don't smell like they used to. It was an odd combination of fragrances and cosmetics and leather and fast food and salon chemicals and candle stores and candy makers and everything all at once. The smell would shift around in character and intensity as you moved about the mall, but the core of it was always there.

Movie theatre lobby is a great smell. They should bottle it.

First day of school was a wonderful smell, and there's nothing in the adult world to replicate it. Sometimes office buildings sort of come close, but it's just not the same smell. Wes Anderson does a good job of turning that smell into a visual aesthetic. I just wish you could smell movies.

CasualConversation,Have you ever read in your dreams?,"Ok this might just be a me thing I’m not sure.

So I love reading I have many books but some days I really get obsessed and I have found that if I read 300+ pages in a day that it will lead into my dreams. Not the story itself well sometimes that you know but no dream me will be reading but it’s complete gibberish.

I’ll be reading out loud and I’ll be looking at myself sitting there holding a book I can’t identify and it will go something like “The one zebra thou shall not zoo zoo zoo liberty and ketchup chrysanthemums forgive me for I have Pokémon shampoo of thy heart” just I mean partial actually stuff with random words and it just goes on and on and on. 

It actually usually wakes me up because it’s so confusing because I have fallen asleep reading then gone into a dream like this and then been confused on if I’m awake or not because in my sleep brain it doesn’t seem like gibberish so I wake up when I realize it’s gibberish then I go back to sleep into the same dream.

If you’re someone who reads a lot you’ll know that rare feeling that were always chasing where it doesn’t feel like you’re reading anymore it feels like you’re somewhere else like you’re in that story and the words come to life and you no longer see the individual words. The dreams feel like that too so it’s extra confusing. 

This is usually a sign that I need to not trap myself in my room as much because reading is good for you but maybe not when you spend an entire day only reading. Like who finishes The Testaments by Margaret Atwood in a single day?! That’s an over 400 paged book yep I need to actually go somewhere today…to the book store it is!

CasualConversation,Has anyone else noticed more cameras being installed at your job? ,"I've worked at my current employer for 4-5 years, and it's been known that there are a handful of cameras on site, primarily near employee entrances. I understand the need to monitor who is entering and exiting the building, for safety reasons. But once we're in the building, why does every single move need to be tracked? At this point, I'm pretty sure the only blind spots are in the bathrooms. 

I'm sure the higher-ups will say ""it's for safety"" but I can't help but think this is the start of, for lack of a better wording, ensuring that I'm being 99.9 percent productive, not 99.8 percent. Think like Amazon etc. I work in manufacturing, a bit more specifically my company remanufactures old parts. So it's not like we can say with 100% certainty that ""product X will take exactly Y:YY amount of time to build, because of all new parts.""

I don't know... this just really bothers me. I live in a single-party consent state, and it's been suggested that existing cameras could record audio. These new ones though, I'm thinking they're just always recording both audio and video. If you've been in a newly constructed school, and see the cameras with like 6 lenses pointed everywhere, that's the type they just installed. I really don't like it.

CasualConversation,Corporate Culture has changed...,"This is more of a musing than anything else.  I work for a large firm, and in my job, I am responsible to make sure 16 offices in 3 states keep talking to one another.  Sounds more glamorous.

In 2020, like so many other companies, we sent everyone home.  Well, except for the few of us who had to remain in the office, like me and my team.  If everyone came into the office in 2019, it would have been over 1100 people in just my office, with another 500 or so in the others (combined).  

Two years ago, my office did a downsizing of real estate and went from 5 floors to 2 in our building.  A good number of employees were converted to a WFH (Work From Home) status full time, meaning they lost their desk/office.  No mandate to work in the office was given at that time.

Last year, there was a reshuffle (for some reason, dont get me started on the office leader here, she's nuts) and then a mandate (company wide, not just our offices) to have a 3/week showing in the office.  Now, we did lose people over the previous 4 years, and if everyone came in it would be closer to 800, but there are seats only for 300 in the office.  Only a percentage (I do not know exactly) are full time WFH and not required to come in.  They do a badge scan count to determin people are following the mandate.

And just today, passed one woman on the way in as I was heading upstairs who said (as I held the door for her) ""Oh, thanks, just here to get credit"" and she scanned her badge and went right back to the elevator...  I would like to say that was an anomaly, but it isnt.  There are 30, 40, 50 year olds literally driving (in some cases) over an hour to just scan a badge and go home.

CasualConversation,I had lice for three years,"When I was a kid, I somehow always managed to get lice. Usually from sleepovers with cousins, occasionally would get it from school. It just happened so often, maybe because I had so much hair for them to hide in too. 

At one point, I had lice for three years straight, from 5th grade to 8th grade. My mom had tried everything. Multiple rounds of lice shampoo and combing through every bit of my hair, washing every service and fabric in the apartment, and even going as far as to put straight up raid in my hair. It felt like nothing worked. I’d wash my hair, brush it, wait for it to dry, braid it to sleep. We’d spray raid in my hair completely, covered it with a plastic bag for an hour to suffocate them. The amount of hair I lost. Nothing was working. My mom was tempted to just shave my head at so many points because it seemed like no matter what it just wouldn’t go away.

Until one day in 8th grade I had my best friend sleepover. I was nervous, but I had multiple sleepovers with family and friends and had only given it to one of my cousins within those three years. It wasn’t until about a week later she called my house phone to tell me she has lice and I should check if I do. I was too embarrassed to admit it, so I just acted surprised, and then called her later to tell her my mom did end up finding lice in my hair. For some reason, after that encounter, they finally went away. 

I’m still best friends with this person, she’ll jokingly remind me of the time I gave her lice when we were kids. But to this day she doesn’t know that I knew I had lice and had known for years. Was it dumb of me ? Yes, but I was also just a kid. Anyways, I always thought it was interesting how none of it ever worked to get rid of them. It was torture. My hair was so fried. I guess I just wonder if anyone else also struggled with lice this much lol",456,0.95,183,nocomment413,2024-11-12 11:40:57,1gpqgm2,639,High

But as she went for higher studies, her interest in reverting to me got lost, she wont revert for days, never initiate from her side, and now we don’t talk at all.

CasualConversation,How do I go about making friends with someone *deliberately*?,"I'm not a very social person (friendly but quiet), always felt uncomfortable in groups, but really enjoy 1-on-1 conversations. So far the friends I've made have all come about kinda ""by circumstance"". Happen to sit together in class, share a work area long enough, etc. Things develop slowly over time, and usually because of enough time spent with the person, we'd become ""friends"" or good acquaintances. Nothing really came about deliberately.

I'm in the ""late-20s/early 30s"" range and over the past several years there have been several occasions where I'd meet new people at work from our seasonal hires (usually college age; I work at a university). But because these positions are short-term, it's hard to build any sort of friendship with these folks, especially as an ""older"" person with ""adult responsibilities"".

This school term I've managed to exchange numbers with someone after only talking a few times (though they probably gave their number out of pressure/obligation because they are ""too nice""). I'm super grateful to have their contact but I know they are getting super busy now with exams etc so I don't want to become a bother to them. I have plans to reach out again in the new year/new term (before exams kick in again), but I'm kinda worried I'd screw it up and scared them off (which I've done in the past, regretfully).

How are folks like me supposed to make friends in a situation like this? Do I ask them to grab a coffee? Or is that kinda weird (or reserved for dates / close friends)??

How do I know if they care about this ""friendship"" if I'm obviously the only one initiating? How can I show that I can be a good friend without appearing desperate?

It feels especially hard because they are mostly making friends with classmates etc and it just seems weird for them to care about a friendship with ""some dude from work"".

CasualConversation,The One Where Me and Aiyana Went From Friends to Enemies,"There’s this girl Aiyana that I met in sixth grade. She seemed nice and friendly at first. Then she slowly started to reveal her true colors as a manipulative, self centered bitch and monster, as she started taking advantage of me for favors.   


She was at worst when she tried to manipulate and trick me into giving her my mom’s credit card under the blatantly false guise that “she is going to use the money to buy decorations and throw me a birthday party.”



 I remember when she was pretending to be nice, she told me to never listen to anyone that says she’s mean under the guise that “they’re just jealous because you and I are best friends.” Eventually, I have had enough of her bullshit, called her out, called the friendship over, and I told my parents. 



They got tired of her bullcrap as well and decided to tell the principal, leading to Aiyana getting suspended from school as punishment (in case you're wondering, my middle school actually had the courage to punish students when they were wrong, and didn’t put up with any misbehavior, unlike most other middle schools, so I was lucky, because then I could come to the principals whenever I had a problem with another student or I was being bullied (but back to the story). 



Thankfully, I didn’t have to deal with her in 7th grade, as she was not on my team that year. I was also kind of unlucky (in some areas, anyway) back then, so you’d think after this, I ***finally*** am rid of Aiyana for good and have caught a break, right? 



**Wrong.** 



A year later, that good turn is undone as I am paired up with Aiyana on team 8-2. She caused a **LOT** of issues in math class in 8th grade. In one instance, we were doing a math competition outside, and my nice teammates were nice enough to say I don’t have to help them and I can just hang out if I want. So I did. I found 2 pieces of chalk in the process, and I just decided to use the chalks. You’d think I was finally catching a break…until Aiyana comes along and bullies and terrorizes me into giving her a piece of chalk. I initially refused until she kept begging and whining like a little bitch (she even yelled in my face), so I gave her it, albeit just to shut her up. And when she was finished with it in 2 minutes, instead of giving it to me, she threw the piece of chalk in the trash just to spite me. 



We never had any problems from then on. Then came summer, and my mom signed me up for Connections so I can make new friends, and I absolutely enjoyed it and was thankful that my mom signed me up (which, with how lazy kids are these days, you don’t exactly see that every day), and I was having the time of my life and it seems like I had finally caught a break this time….until Aiyana came along for the third time. When we were at lunch, she sat next to me just to spite me. When I was in the theater room, she did the same thing and sat next to me (though I DID move at all times she did so).   


She kept on bullying and bullying me increasingly until on the second day of Connections, I had enough to the point I cried and broke down in tears. Thankfully, this nice mentor who was 16 at the time, comforted me and I called my mom and she comforted me and she contacted the teacher and they made sure I wasn‘t in ANY classes with her. 



On the third day, she tried to sit next to me, and I asked her to move, she wouldn’t move, so I said “Wow. Screw you.”. My mom got tired of her, and she talked to her parents and sister to get to the bottom of this. As usual, Aiyana tries to play the victim. 



She gets offended, and tries to play the victim and paint me as the bully in front of my mom. Naturally, my mom has had enough of Aiyana’s bullshit, and tells her off and rants on her. It’s not a good reason, but the reason she is why the way she is is because (don’t get me wrong, she was like this BEFORE the whole suspension thing) she wants revenge because she thinks I’m a snitch for telling on her in sixth grade and even now as a 15 year old, she says it is all my fault that she got suspended, and she says “Thanks a lot” in a sarcastic manner a lot too. I don’t have ANY classes with her now. None. Zero. And I had finally caught a break with Aiyana for real after it being cruelly yanked away 3 times, and I now have a good high school experience happily ever after.

CasualConversation,Do you guys remember the lamp guy?,"I experienced something similar. Once while I was going through one of my roughest depressive episodes, I slept for a week straight. I mean that almost literally. I only got out of bed when I needed to use the bathroom. Even if I was in bed but not actively sleeping I would lay there as if I were sleeping and have immersive daydreams with my eyes closed until I fell asleep again. My dreams have always been super realistic. Plus I’m sure my mental illness has something to do with this. I have confused dreams for memories and would have to investigate whether this event that I remember happened in real life or in a dream. This is why I whole heartedly believe that if I live to see old age, my mind will go long before my body does. Anyways, during that episode I dreamt that my mom died. 

The dream was so realistic that I woke up with a drenched face that was a mixture of sweat and tears. Then I couldn’t stop thinking about the fact that my super sweet mother will actually die someday. I cried myself back to sleep and the dream picked up right where it left off from before, which has never happened to me! This cycle repeated it’s self for a full eight days until my mom threatened (with love) to take me to the hospital. I was so freaked out that I was talking to someone that I was actively mourning that I made myself get out of bed and go lie in the grass. 

Then I was afraid to go to sleep again so I stayed out all night. I did this for a few days until the depression wore off which it always does. My mom remained convinced for years until she actually died, that depression was a mind over matter thing since I was able to pull myself out of it to avoid the hospital. Which wasn’t true lol I just went else where to be depressed. It absolutely is true that sunlight, fresh air, a change of scenery and exercise does wonders for mental, physical and emotional health for most creatures though. Also no I absolutely did not want to go to the hospital. Sooo my mom was actually onto something. Just not exactly what she thought.

Of course I talked to all of my doctors about it. After therapy, a sleep study and obviously reading Reddit, I now know that this phenomenon is actually pretty common and I’ve never had an original experience in my life…

The confrontation with these other humans could have caused early Homo sapiens to develop an instinct for recognizing differences between the species and could have triggered an evolutionary fear or distrust of Homo sapiens-like but not fully Homo sapiens creatures.

TrueAskReddit,Earning the Right to Vote: A Fresh Look at Democracy,"For a while now, I’ve been mulling over a pretty controversial question: **Should everyone really have the right to vote?** From a young age, we’ve been taught that democracy is the best system, a fair process where everyone’s voice counts equally. But the more I think about it, the more I wonder: what if not everyone is actually equipped to make such important decisions? What if some people, despite having the right, are simply **not capable** of voting in a way that benefits society as a whole?

Let me explain where I’m coming from. I live in a country where the majority of the population is manipulated by the government, driven by deep-seated biases—sexism, racism, religious intolerance, and misogyny. The education system is in shambles, leaving people uninformed about critical political issues. Every election, this majority chooses leaders who mirror their own prejudices, and those leaders, in turn, reinforce these biases, keep the population uneducated, and use fear tactics to scapegoat minority groups and neighboring countries. It’s a vicious cycle where the majority elects leaders who cater to their worst impulses, and as a result, **real progress is held back**.

This leads me to my controversial thought: **What if we restricted the right to vote to those who are truly informed and unbiased?** Imagine a system where only individuals who pass a ""citizen exam"" are allowed to vote. This exam wouldn’t measure intelligence, but rather values, awareness, and tolerance. It would assess whether someone harbors prejudice, whether they’re informed about key issues in their country and the world, and how they stand on topics like equality and education.

Those who pass would be granted the status of “good citizens” and earn the right to vote. This “good citizen” title wouldn’t just be about voting rights—it would become a symbol of honor, something people aspire to, inspiring others to become more informed and open-minded. The idea is that **if only the informed, tolerant, and morally responsible citizens could vote**, we’d elect governments that prioritize equality, education, and real societal progress. Policies would be driven by rational thinking, not prejudice or fear.

But here’s the **biggest flaw** in this idea—and it’s one I can’t ignore. **The majority—those who wouldn’t pass such an exam—would never allow this system to happen.** People don’t like being told they’re unfit or incapable, especially when it comes to something as personal and fundamental as their right to vote. The majority will **never admit** that they’re not qualified to make decisions that impact an entire nation. They’ll fight tooth and nail to protect the current system because it validates their voice, even if that voice leads to the election of corrupt, oppressive leaders who harm the country in the long run.

It’s a painful reality. Most people don’t want to face the possibility that they’re part of the problem. It’s much easier to blame others—to point fingers at minority groups, immigrants, or neighboring countries—than to accept that perhaps their own biases and lack of awareness are holding society back. **This is why such a system would be nearly impossible to implement**, because the very people who would lose their voting rights are the ones who have the most power in a democracy.

Even if, hypothetically, we could implement this system, there’s another huge risk: **corruption**. If a corrupt government were to manipulate the ""good citizen"" exam, they could rig the process to favor their own supporters. Imagine if the exam questions were designed to only pass those who share the ruling party’s ideology. Or worse, the criteria for being a “good citizen” could be manipulated, allowing the government to redefine what it means to be a qualified voter in a way that only benefits them. In this scenario, the exam would no longer serve as a tool for fairness, but rather as a way for corrupt leaders to stay in power.

That’s why it’s crucial that the **citizen exam board**—the body responsible for overseeing this process—remains completely independent and unbiased. They would need real power to resist political pressure and ensure the system stays transparent. Without these safeguards, the exam system could become just as flawed and corrupt as the current state of democracy, where leaders pander to the uninformed masses to win votes.

In the end, while I believe this theoretical system could lead to more responsible governance and a more informed electorate, **I also know that it’s highly unlikely to happen in reality**. The majority will never admit they are unqualified, and even if we could somehow implement this, the system could still be hijacked by those in power to serve their own interests.

So, here’s the question: **Is democracy truly fair** when everyone has the right to vote, regardless of their knowledge or biases? Should voting rights be something that’s earned, based on a person’s understanding and moral responsibility? Or does such a system pose too many risks of corruption and power abuse?

I know this idea is provocative, but I think it’s worth discussing. What do you think? Is democracy, in its current form, really as fair as we’ve been led to believe? Should we rethink who gets to vote, and if so, how can we protect such a system from being exploited? Let’s talk about it!",0,0.33,33,AC1D-TITAN,2024-10-16 09:05:17,1g506o3,33,High

TrueAskReddit,"Leaving the world of human relationships, to find solace, connection and purpose elsewhere. Thoughts and experiences?","I (31F)'ve had a very tough five years. I'm still in the process of freeing myself from depression and CPTSD-like symptoms and recovering some sense of well-being and direction.

Looking back to these five years, there are three main causes of my suffering:

1. Life happens
2. Human relationships
3. Human mind and body

The first is obvious, we are in a game we have no control of and that can change the rules any time. It's pre-programmed, and it doesn't care about our well-being or survival. We do.

The second might be obvious, but it still surprises me how people think that the solution to their problem, more often than not caused by their relationships: parents, partners, friends, etc, is more relationships.

The third is a tough lesson to learn: the mind and the body truly have a life and a memory of their own. Thoughts and feelings come into our awareness instead of us being their authors. We, in the seat of The Observateur, observe how things play in our minds and bodies but have very little control of it all. People need a locus of control and so create narratives like 'Let go of everything you can't control, focus on self-control', which are bullshit as demonstrated by neuroscience, physics and philosophy. An example is when you intellectually understand something as natural. Still, it emotionally breaks you and even takes you to look at life differently, in some cases, to end it all.

Lately, I've realised that I'm much happier and stable when I focus on my relationship with the world - as an anonymous system with many human faces but without too much attachment and profoundness to avoid unnecessary damage - and my relationship with my dog.

I no longer believe in love and friendship, beyond a romanticisation that has little to do with reality.

There are rare exceptions that are unlikely to apply to 99% of humanity and under this basis, and being myself in that 99%, I have realized that the above is a better and healthier way forward.

I came here to hear about the experiences of people who also arrived at this logical conclusion and actually took it to its limits, which is to say, they actually lived it.",9,0.77,23,paradoxical_embrace,2024-10-07 08:06:36,1fy75s2,32,High
TrueAskReddit,"Does technology serve people, or do people serve technology?","This is a thought I’ve been forming thanks to my studies in computer science.

Our professors also discuss this topic from time to time during lessons. One of our professors gave an example: suppose a Moroccan woman (don’t ask me why he was so specific) needs to make requests at an embassy to get some documents approved.

With the transition from paper to digital, she cannot easily access this embassy service, but must necessarily go through IT interfaces to upload the documents.

If she doesn’t know how to use the technology, how can she upload the documents? She must necessarily rely on an expert.

So what has technology solved in this example? Nothing, it has only created problems and hasn’t sped anything up.

Technology should be inclusive, but in reality, it excludes those who use it, because it’s designed for people who already understand and use it.

Let me give another example, one that might clarify the situation, especially for those working in this industry.

Take a web programmer. Today, a web programmer doesn’t need significant prerequisites to get hired by a company. This is because the industry has “frameworks.”

For those who don’t know what frameworks are, imagine them as gigantic libraries. In these libraries, you can find “common operations” (imagine them as books) that are useful for executing web applications.

So, to become a web developer, you just need to learn these standard operations without understanding what’s actually happening inside them. In short, they use the “book” without knowing what’s written inside.

How does this connect to the case of the Moroccan woman? Well, a web programmer has the illusion of creating something, but in reality, they’re just taking something pre-built and reconfiguring it to create a specific web application.

This also creates the illusion of technological progress, but that’s a topic for another day.

A web programmer is more of a user than a creator of technology, just like the Moroccan woman trying to request documents from her embassy.

What happens when something in the framework breaks? Framework users can only wait for the bug to be fixed, blocking all infrastructures that depend on the framework.

What’s the moral? No one really knows how technology works anymore, not even those who work directly with it.

In this way, people become slaves to technology because they are dependent on it. Without it, they can’t work.

You might ask: “But who develops the frameworks? Do they control the technology, or do they also depend on other technologies and only know how to use those?”

The answer is the latter. Frameworks themselves depend on hundreds of thousands of dependencies, each solving a specific problem.

What’s the result of this? In this web of software depending on other software, it’s like a domino effect. If one piece falls, everything falls.

Here’s an example: a package called “left-pad” consisted of just 11 lines of code.

The author, in protest, removed the package from the web, and suddenly, a wide range of applications stopped working.

Essentially, technology now exists to support itself, and no one really knows what it’s built on anymore.

New programmers don’t care about learning how things really work because “there’s no need to reinvent the wheel.”

But in reality, the wheel must be reinvented as many times as possible because there isn’t a universal version of the wheel. There’s one for snow, one for the city, one for off-road, etc.

Each context needs an optimized version.

If the “general-purpose” wheel stops working, you can rest easy because your version, optimized for your personal purpose, can only break within your specific use case.

And since the use case is controlled and circumscribed, a problem can be easily solved.

This argument might seem delirious today, but in 10, 20, 30, or even 100 years, it will become more true.

Fewer and fewer people (especially newcomers to this industry) will understand how things work at a foundational level, and everything will seem random or even “magical.”

One day, something fundamental will stop working, and everything will collapse.

As fewer people understand the basic elements, these problems will become harder to solve.

In summary, to avoid becoming slaves to technology, it’s essential to understand how it works at the deepest level possible.

But one question remains: how do we help the Moroccan woman access technology? We need to design simpler and more accessible solutions.

This also applies to those working in technology. Frameworks are too complex; we need something simpler, and end users will benefit from this as well.

If an actual study or paper was linked, the author misquoted a lot of them, drew parallels that didn't exist, or just used completely irrelevant studies to ""prove"" their point. Of course there were also a bunch of just bad ""sources"" (like other articles written by the same author, or other conspiracy theorists). If you're just scrolling through, it has all sorts of graphs and links and could vaguely appear credible, but when you actually try to follow the logic, it doesn't add up. 

Anyway, my colleague shared a link to this article (which I'm reluctant to share but I can if it helps). The whole antivax thing really kicked off for him during covid, and now he's convinced they all have like metals and poison or some shit, and he's afraid to have his daughter vaccinated.

TrueAskReddit,Would artists be able to earn a living through crowdsourcing if copyright was abolished?,"I’ve heard some people advocating for the abolishment of copyright and all the benefits that could have, but obviously the biggest concern is whether people would be getting paid for their art, coming up with the new inventions, developing software, etc. The most common response I’ve heard is that artists would first have to develop some free stuff to make a name for themselves, and then afterwards would be able to just switch the order of how they monetise their content. Just put a target of how much money they’d like to make before they’d release their content.

This has some benefits, as artists get their money before developing their product, so it’s safer as they’ll never spend resources developing a product that isn’t successful. But this also creates an upper limit to profit.

Furthermore, on the consumer side, this could create cashgrabs, but also could incentivise creators to take some risks, which is beneficial in the long term.

I have definitely found great information on Reddit and some Facebook groups., However, I've also found lots of spammers and useless content. Some people do not set out to mislead - it's just that they may have had wildly differing experiences.

Generally, I look over the forum in question. If the general tone is ok - respectful and helpful - it's a good sign. If not, well...it takes about 5 to 10 minutes of intensive reading to get the ""Feel""

Already, to master a subject requires many years of advanced learning. I'm thinking of learning linearly, where you build on previous information to expand, like a pyramid hierarchy of learning.

If we look at coding for websites, original internet sites (were not only awful but) required knowledge of C++, etc. to be able to code. Nowadays this process is streamlined through UX services that allow for basic website creation, bypassing the need for some people to know how to code. I get that coding is still important but bear with me here.

Let's say astrophysics advances to the point that we now have the methods available to travel at the speed of light. The sheer amount of new science one must learn must be staggering; I wonder if a single human being would be able to learn all of this information in a single lifetime. I would assume they would.

TrueAskReddit,"Are there connections between form, materia, temperature and function, and deontic terms like good, bad, right and wrong?","Somethings function is dependent on the form and materia of the entity. 

Possibly there are no other elements that will affect function. 

A. But what is heat or energy, and how does it come to be? 

B. How can heat or cold influence the potential for movement or even make movement necessary or impossible for the thing, organism or entity in any form it can come in?  

Let's say that to fully understand a thing, we need to understand it’s purpose. (Or purposes, for complex things.) 

A plant's purpose is to get nutrition, to grow, and to reproduce. Whether a plant is ""good"" or ""bad"" depends on the various levels of functioning of those purposes of the plant. 

Or whether a tool is ""good"" or ""bad"" depends on the level of function it has to fullfill it's purpose, or the meaning of it. 

For an animal it’s not only about those three (get nutrition, grow and to reproduce) but also depending on what type of animal it is, about locomotion, and perception. 

So the perfect animal will be having perfect function of those purposes.

C. But can we correctly define “good” in this way, and as something that can be fully explained in a way that “good” will merely be reduced to being a objective fact in the world? (A very difficult fact to get knowledge of, but non the less an objective fact.)

Humans are said to have the purposes of the plant, and of the animal, but also keep reason or an ability to deliberate.  

D. Can a person be a good person, but not with that logically following that she will be a moral person? 

Allthough Kant would claim that what is moral duty is something that can be understood with the ability of reason or by a rational ability.

TrueAskReddit,"Is Human Technology Just a Rudimentary Attempt to Mimic Nature, or Does It Surpass It?","I've been reflecting on how much of our technology seems to lag behind the efficiency and complexity found in the natural world. Even in areas where there isn’t a clear natural counterpart, we struggle to match what nature has accomplished through millions of years of evolution.

Consider these examples:

* **Mobility:** Animals have evolved remarkable ways to move that we still haven’t fully replicated in our transportation systems. The agility of a cheetah, the precise flight of insects, or the way dolphins navigate the ocean are feats of natural mobility that far surpass our vehicles and robotics.
* **Collective Efficiency:** Fungal networks, ant colonies, and termite mounds operate with an efficiency that outperforms many of our human systems. These natural collectives excel in resource distribution, communication, and energy management in ways we’re still trying to fully understand and emulate.
* **Energy Utilization:** Nature's ability to generate, store, and utilize energy is far superior to what we've achieved with our current technology. Processes like photosynthesis, cellular energy conversion, and the efficient storage of energy in fat reserves are examples where natural efficiency greatly exceeds our own capabilities.

And when we look at the human body itself, the comparison becomes even more striking:

* **Processing Power:** The human brain processes information at a level that makes even the most advanced supercomputers look rudimentary. From processing vast amounts of sensory data in real time to executing complex motor functions, the brain's efficiency and capacity are unparalleled.
* **Regenerative Abilities:** The body’s ability to heal, adapt, and maintain homeostasis is something we’ve only scratched the surface of replicating with medical technology.
* **Biochemical Processing:** The liver, kidneys, and other organs manage detoxification, nutrient processing, and waste elimination with an efficiency and reliability that outpaces any artificial system we've developed.

Given all this, I’m curious to hear what others think:

* **To what extent can we consider human technology as merely mimicking nature, and how rudimentary is it in comparison?**
* **Where do we see examples of natural processes, especially within the human body, that still outperform our best technologies?**
* **Does this perspective help us identify where our technology needs to improve, or does it limit our view of what technological progress should be?**

TrueAskReddit,Are things actively getting worse or is this just part of getting older?,"I've been noticing things recently that are making me question whether things are getting worse or maybe I'm just getting older and its a changing part of life.

For background I'm in my mid 30s' in NYC.

Things I feel have changed?

* I remember very well growing up hanging out with lots of friends going out to movies, music shows, festivals, skating, etc.
* Restaurants having decent service, food was good and portions were right and things were open earlier/later.
* The internet was better too IMO, it felt like there were tons of curated unique websites that had their own style (granted some of that ""style"" was terrible font/color/layout) But not everything was on the same 10 webpages.
* The news seemed more positive and uplifting, and people seemed to be happier, less stressed,

Nowadays I feel like none of this is true anymore. I still go to festivals, music shows, etc and don't see many people in their teens-20s out socializing. Its not that I'm only going to older things either, I've been to EDM festivals and there are more of that demographic there but still overwhelmingly older groups.

Restaurants all seem to suck now too. You no longer get a side with your entree, the entree is small and very basic if not microwaved, a drink costs the same as a side. Food is very meh quality even in fancier places. I feel like the food I get at the bodega is just as good as a nice 70/80$ meal.

The internet seems extremely homogenized. Every site has the same exact layout, same font, same color scheme. And everything seems to be put into ""Walmart supercenter"" like sites that have everything in them (looking at you as well reddit) I feel like this takes away the uniqueness of the communities, the different styles they have, the conversations are much more regulated and controlled. And community forums are all but dead, I have a few niche hobbies and interests but despite knowing there is a large collective of us all the communities around it are basically archived forums that get maybe one or two posts a month.

I also feel like friend groups have gotten so depressed lately and drifted apart. Not just mine but I hear the same thing from other people I talk to in various age ranges. It seems like so many people are going the path of the hikikomori and just hermiting it up in their houses scrolling their life away on tiktok or instagram.

This might be an American observation as I have not traveled the world but I feel like so many people are drifting away from socialization and the social bonds and communities that help us out as humans with a social desire/need are being starved leading to more people feeling alone and isolated.

TrueAskReddit,Does altruism exist? (Psychology),"Does altruism exist? 

There is a claim by Feinberg that the only thing anyone is capable of desiring or pursuing ultimately or fundamentally (opposed to instrumentally or non-fundamentally) is what's (at least believed to be) in his own self-interest and/or the interests of his genepool. (His children or parents, etc.)

That is simply how people are psychologically wired to be. 

Is that false? Will (normal) humans sometimes desire or pursue something that is not for promoting their own self-interest, and altruism is true, so they desire or pursue what is (at least believed to be) in someone else's self-interest and that for itself? 

There are defenders of psychological egoism who offer explanations for behaviors that may seem altruistic. 

For example, if you see someone suffering, you want to elevate that suffering because (1) it makes you feel bad, and you wish to give yourself relief or take away your own bad feelings. 

Or (2) you want to elevate the suffering because you believe you will be rewarded socially, economically, and/or get benefits from other people, like the person you’ll save. 

Or (3) you want to elevate the suffering because you believe that you will eventually feel guilt if you do not help the person. Maybe you want to avoid social sanctions. 

In nature, it doesn’t happen that a non-human animal ""intentionally"" acts to promote another's well-being, at least so without some ultimate motive of self-gain. (?) 

If this psychological egoism is true, what consequences does it have for how we ought to act? We can’t reasonably be asked to do things that are impossible, so because of our psychology.  Nor can we reasonably be blamed for not doing what's impossible to do.

TrueAskReddit,Do you think Joe is responsible for fact checking everything he says in his podcast?,"Since I don't meet the requirements to ask that question on r/JoeRogan I do it here.

I noticed that negative opinions about Joe and his podcast are the suprising majority on this subreddit. As a someone who enjoys the podcast, I tend to disagree with some of them. I would like to understand those negative opinions.

I don't want to change anyone's opinions, but here is my point of view for the context:

I don't think the podcast is advertised or gives an impression of a valid source of information. Joe comes from a position of a comedian and a speaker. His job is to make people entertained. He often says that people shouldn't take any serious advice from him. Yes, it doesn't stop him from talking about many topics with a lot of confidence. But isn't it just a part of his character? He's a very curious person and a pro speaker. Big part of why his podcast is so popular.

Yes, there are people that suffered because they believed the things he said. Yet, why do we put the responsibility on Joe instead of the people? If Joe's says he's just a dude and not an expert, every chance he has, yet some people forget about it and take medical advice from him (vaccines etc.), then can't they only blame themselves?

The most interesting aspect of the podcast is the relaxed, authentic, unfiltered long-form conversation. Like the one you'd have with a friend in private. I believe that people look for that when they listen to this podcast. Not for science, facts and life advice. It would be very hard for Joe to ditch the free form conversation format and do a 180 turn into the eduction field, with fact checking, giving source for every information and trying to be unbiased with his topics. Not only hard, but disappointing for most of his fanbase, that listens to him for who he is.

Great power comes with great responsibility. I agree with that statement. That's why I believe that Joe has some moral obligations that come with his kind of success. Where do we draw the line though? 

Do you believe Joe is in the wrong here? What would be a valid solution to this problem in your opinion?

Edit: just to be clear. People answer as if Joe literally gave statements like ""You shouldn't get vaccinated."", ""Government is run by aliens and it's absolute truth"". When it's more like ""I personally am suspicious about those new vaccines."" ""What I'm about to say is very likely to be false, but it's fun to talk about."" I'm not trying to defend him, it's just what I've noticed after watching about a dozen episodes.

TrueAskReddit,Why society does not produces prodigies like von Neumann anymore?,"In general, more people are graduating from schools and colleges than ever before. We have better technology and access to education, but it seems like there hasn't been a corresponding increase in ""prodigies"" compared to the number of graduating students.

There could be several reasons for this. Perhaps the bar for what is considered a genius has risen. Additionally, what works for the masses does not necessarily work for prodigies. These prodigies often had aristocratic tutors, family dynamics, and hereditary propensities contributing to their tremendous intellectual greatness. The institutions created for the masses may not be effective in nurturing genius. It might also be related to resources outside the formal education systems. For example, great tutors have become really expensive or have shifted their focus to the corporate world of Silicon Valley. Having an aristocratic and extremely inspiring individual could actually be an essential component of producing prodigies.

Furthermore, a hundred years ago, there were fewer options for highly intelligent individuals; they would probably go into teaching. Now, there are many lucrative options available, leading to competition for the same highly intelligent people.

However, I am not convinced that highly intelligent individuals would necessarily make good teachers. Being a good teacher often requires empathy, effective communication, and care. It's very personal and intimate. Yes, understanding the subject is important, but to teach a 15-year-old, for example, you don't need postgraduate-level knowledge. Those who are going to be good particle physicists might not make good teachers anyway.

TrueAskReddit,"Humes law is not compatible with utilitarianism, so with which theory of value does Humes law work?","Humes law states that we can not derive an ""ought to"" proposition from an ""is"" proposition. Purely neutral statements is different from statements about how things should be. Lets say that tigers are an endangered species, the deciders within the government does not want to have a wall built between Mexico and Texas, or Amanda is unhappy about her current boss. From sentences like these, it's not logically possible to deduce or derive any ""ought to"" proposition, or propositions stating how things should and shouldn't be, according to Humes Law. 

For example ""If the government doesn't want/like to do something, then it should be done."" Or ""If if the government doesn't want to do something then it should not be done."" Will not be logically valid.

One could say that to derive a value or ""ought to"" statement, from a thesis, then that thesis must also be about value or not purely a factual statement. 

But according to utilitarianism a neutral factual state will be equal to a moral state or a moral proposition, although it's complex. (Moral) P is right (replace P with any neutral factual statement) means that P has better consequences than any other alternative. So, here, right and wrong is entirely dependent on consequences for happiness and suffering. Right is defined and equal to some specific natural ""is"" state in the world. 

Although, likely very complicated to know what right or wrong may be, it's derivable from facts in the world.

After all morality is not trivial, and it's not up to individuals to decide, so they are correct, whatever they believe. There are horrific attitudes, for example ""It's right to starve & torture my child because I think he's homosexual"", or ""it's suitable to throw acid in the face of a woman who doesn't want to marry me."" Also, people can be mistaken about whats right, and people or cultures can progress or regress morally.

TrueAskReddit,Are forced labor prisons considered slavery or indentured servitude?,"
My friends and I are having a debate on this question. I believe these prisoners are slaves as they are being forced to serve without wanting to. Therefore, it is against their will and I would say is considered slavery. On the other hand, my friends say it is indentured servitude because they made the decision to commit the crime in the first place. Therefore the decision to serve was made when they committed the crime. Please let me know what you think.

TrueAskReddit,Can something ever be truly known and with nothing left to discover?,"I mean, according to scientists and philosophers, we can never know something thoroughly, because the nature of the universe is infinite. 

Take a single Atom for example, we thought it's the smallest, then we discovered particles, then we discovered quantum mechanics, then we discovered more stuff, then it's just one discovery after another and we just can't have a complete picture of its features. 

Does this mean we can never know something completely or is it possible to discover its limits?

Confession,"Girl best friend slapped my butt, and now i am a dumbass","So my girl best friend slapped my butt when i was going up the stairs, and i didnt mind it, and told her that i dont mind as long as i can do the same since she said it was a joke, and she has a boyfriend, so as long as he knows too. she said no, because girls are more sensitive to this thing. And i said that its not okay to do this and not expect the same. As i believe girls and boys should be treated the same no matter what. And she said it would be cheating if i did it, because she has a boyfriend, but if she has one then why slap mine? even in a joke, and now my best best friend who is a boy says she is right and i should just laugh it off.

Confession,Fat Acceptance Movement Made Being Fat Easier and I Regret Accepting It. ,"
I want to share my journey with the Fat Acceptance (FA) and Health at Every Size (HAES) movements and how they helped me come to terms with my obesity. I’m also going to talk about why I’m now working toward losing weight, not because of societal pressure, but because I’ve realized that my health, both mental and physical, would be significantly better if I were in a healthier weight range.

For a long time, I felt like there was a battle between what I wanted to believe about my body and what I knew to be true about my health. On one hand, I’d spent years being shamed for my weight, constantly being told I wasn’t healthy enough, not attractive enough, or just plain “wrong” because of my size. But on the other hand, the messages in the Fat Acceptance and HAES movements made me feel like I was allowed to love my body and that health didn’t have to be tied to size. They made me feel like it was okay to be obese, that I could still live a full and meaningful life regardless of my weight.

However, while those movements gave me a sense of relief in terms of body positivity, they didn’t change the reality of what my obesity was doing to my health. I had convinced myself for years that being obese didn’t have to negatively impact my health, but as time passed, I couldn’t ignore the fact that I was struggling with several issues that were only getting worse.

Here are some of the health issues I faced as my weight increased:
	•	Increased Appetite: I was constantly hungry. No matter how much I ate, my appetite never seemed to be satisfied, leading to overeating and constant cravings that I couldn’t shake off.
	•	Trouble Sleeping: I developed sleep apnea and had a hard time getting a full night’s rest. It wasn’t just the snoring—it was the constant waking up in the middle of the night, struggling to breathe. I woke up feeling exhausted, even after a full night’s sleep.
	•	Depression: I struggled with feelings of isolation, guilt, and shame. Despite the body positivity movement, the weight and the toll it was taking on my mental health were undeniable. I would sometimes feel like I wasn’t really accepted, like I was kidding myself by pretending everything was fine.
	•	Joint Pain and Stiffness: The more weight I gained, the more pain I experienced, especially in my knees and back. It was getting harder to move, and simple tasks became increasingly painful.
	•	Lack of Energy and Fatigue: I felt sluggish all the time. It was hard to get out of bed in the morning, and I’d often find myself feeling drained by midday. Doing anything active felt exhausting, even just walking or climbing stairs.
	•	Alcoholism: To cope with the emotional weight of my situation (no pun intended), I found myself drinking more. It was a way to numb the discomfort, but it only exacerbated my issues with weight, sleep, and overall mental health.

After years of struggling with all of this, I realized that my health wasn’t just about my size—it was about the toll obesity was taking on my life. Yes, the Fat Acceptance and HAES movements helped me feel better about existing in a larger body, but I now see that truly caring for my body means making changes for my long-term health.

I’ve started losing weight, not because of the external pressure or judgment, but because I want to feel better mentally and physically. The benefits I’ve already experienced in just a few months have been incredible. My energy is up, I sleep better, my joint pain has lessened, and I’m feeling much more in control of my life. My mental health has improved too—there’s something about the act of taking charge of my body that’s helped me feel more empowered, confident, and hopeful.

In the end, I don’t think the Fat Acceptance or HAES movements were wrong for encouraging self-love and body acceptance. But I’ve come to realize that self-love also means taking care of yourself, and that sometimes involves making hard choices about your health. It’s not about shaming yourself or anyone else; it’s about prioritizing your well-being and being realistic about the long-term effects of obesity.

Losing weight is a deeply personal choice, and for me, it’s been a necessary step toward a healthier, more fulfilling life. I’m still learning to navigate the balance between accepting my body and taking responsibility for my health, but I feel much better now that I’m making these changes for the right reasons.",444,0.86,67,WuggaWuggaWorm,2024-11-13 09:34:04,1gqfkfl,511,High
Confession,im going to give myself a year for something to change ,"I hate myself, my life, and my body. I’ve had an eating disorder go unchecked for years and I’m slowly dying. I like my job alright but I don’t make much, enough to get kicked off the free healthcare but not enough to afford healthcare, so fixing my health and mental health don’t really seem like options to me. I have an apartment I can barely afford so I’m really just trying to make it to the end of my lease (so a little less than a year).  I really just feel like I have nothing going for me. My health is declining pretty rapidly as of late. My job will never lead anywhere. My relationships are a joke. My family hardly reaches out unless they need something. My boyfriend stays with me out of pity. Any time he’s tried to leave he ends up staying because I cry too much. I feel like he’s getting sick of me though he’s going to leave eventually. Like my lease runs out on Halloween and one time I accidentally almost offed myself with a broiler and a cold small apartment and it felt so good. With the way the world and the economy is headed I don’t even want to be around I want that peace and bliss before I drift off to sleep. But I need like a date in my mind and I want to be pretty fair so I feel like a year is plenty of time I don’t think I’ll be around much longer anyway. I just needed to tell someone I guess I do feel a little guilty because I’m definitely not telling anyone in my life.",23,0.9,22,No_End7899,2024-11-13 19:39:39,1gqtl9x,45,High
Confession,I didn't put away my edibles leading to my mom thinking it was cake,"I haven't made edibles in a long time as they usually taste horrible or they turn out burnt; but with the impact of covid, I wanted to reduce smoking to preserve my lungs.

This time with the help of some friends I managed to make some strong brownies which tasted alright. One night I ate two thirds and left the rest saran wrapped on my desk. . Now that I look back, I should have better hidden the brownie but as I was completely baked that night, I had simply put it on the far corner of my desk. What makes it worse is that the night before, our family celebrated a birthday and we all had chocolate cake.



Everything goes fine the next morning and I noticed that the third of remaining brownie was gone; I thought that it was binned as what remained was a few pieces and a crumbly mess. Two hours later, I get a call from my mom's boss telling me that she is very sick. I rushed over to help and was able to bring mom back home. During the car ride back she said that she felt very dizzy and had a loss of sensation; she even mentioned that her colleagues were about to call the paramedics. Mom mentioned that she thought she was having a stroke and was retracing her morning when she casually let out that she finished off the 'cake' on my desk.



Everything clicks into place and I realise it was all just from the brownie so I gave her reassurance and took care of her. Mom is still freaking out thinking she had a brush with death but after a couple hours, some rest and food she feels back to normal. Now I don't know how or when to explain it all to her; she knows a little about my recreational smoke and hasn't been too happy about it.",120,0.89,56,PsychologicalSky3814,2024-11-13 09:31:29,1gqfiba,176,High

Confession,I lied about needing glasses and now my eyes are wrecked ,"So basically in kindergarten I just wanted to sooo quirky and different (main character energy) so I started subtly saying my vision was blurry and acting clumsy, so that my mum would take me to the eye doctors.

Now (I’m in my teens) I’ve stopped wearing the glasses (much to my mother’s dismay), saying that “I can see fine now they must have worked”.

Confession,Just telling you I found my fire. Time for change. ,"25, black male. I live with my family. I have enough credits to finish my AA in 2 quarters.

We have a bad relationship with his side of the family so reaching out for help for them would be useless. Its been the hardest time ever for me. But I can't complain I'm blessed I even have a dad and a family. Life for me is routine routine routine. I have no social life, and don't care for one I think. Most friends I thought I had stopped caring once they saw I didn't have time to sit in a smoke circle with them. Good riddance I guess but still I miss being apart of something greater than myself. My bestfriend blew up our friendship in 2021 right before I got fired from my job, same time my dad worsened so much that he couldn't get into bed without me lifting him. It hit me like a bus. The realization my foundation of reality shifted. I dream of retirement, yeah I know but I feel old. Having been away from most of my close friends I think my mindset has changed to wanting to correct the chaos of my family. It used to be wanting to move out and waste money in materialism, hedonism, etc. But now I have a fire inside that is brewing. Realizing no one really cares. Like really no one gives a damn.

Confession, Leaving a Toxic Atmosphere and Looking for Real Connections,"Hey everyone,

I want to share a bit about my recent journey. Just a few days ago, I decided to leave Fetlife—a site I originally joined because it seemed like a community for open-minded, kink-friendly people where everyone could just be themselves without judgment. I hoped to find genuine connections, friendships, and maybe even more. But, honestly, it just didn’t turn out that way.

Over time, I began to see just how toxic the environment was, especially for women. So many of the men on that site don’t truly respect women or see them as equals. Their approach was often aggressive and objectifying, leaving little room for meaningful conversation or genuine connection. I felt like I wasn’t being seen as a person, but rather just as something to fulfill their fantasies without consideration for my own boundaries, comfort, or interests.

It was taking a toll on me, more than I initially realized. Every night, as I scrolled through my messages and watched the same patterns play out, I started feeling lonelier and lonelier. I realized that staying in that space was doing more harm than good, draining my mental energy and making me feel like I had to compromise who I was to fit in or get along. So, I finally decided to leave that world behind.

Today, I joined this new site hoping to find something better. I’m hoping for a place where people want to get to know each other realistically and respect boundaries and show empathy and kindness. I’m craving a sense of community and the chance to meet people who value genuine connection over surface-level interactions.

I know this may seem like a lot for an introduction, but I wanted to be open about why I’m here and what I’m looking for. At the end of the day, I’d love to find friends who bring light into each other’s lives and who I can share thoughts and conversations with—something real and human, not transactional.

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to meeting people who feel the same way. 😊",2,1.0,5,Responsible_Help_622,2024-11-13 17:59:55,1gqrink,7,High
Confession,Making men angry before I know we’re about to fuck turns me on,"It’s definitely science related for sure, but for some reason I get extremely turned on when men get angry (mainly men I’m attracted to) but the right guy doesn’t even have to talk dirty to me, just tell me what to do and be commanding. Sometimes I’ll even catch myself trying to see them agitated before sex = instant water flow. Cavewoman brain happy.

Ok lemme just add that it’s not something I do on purpose, it depends on the situation like a play argument or something civil not full on abuse, holy fuck, more like “involuntary brat”

Also i should add: I don’t consider being crazy or insane “cute” after a certain age so this has me questioning damn am I insane??

*hours later update* so basically when I made this post it was just a revelation I had. I didn’t process it as a kink, more like a severe mental problem. Identifying it as a “Kink” seems to make more sense based on the comments.

Confession,"I chose science over arts, but my heart lies in literature ","Hi guys, im in a bit of dilemma here, id like some advice. I chose PCB (Physics, Chemistry, Biology) in 11th grade because of my love for biology and as a backup plan. I have another career path in mind that’s my main goal, but if that doesn’t work out, I want a stable option. Biology felt like a safe second choice, something that could provide stability if my first career doesn’t work out. So, I took science to keep that door open.

My first career choice is a bit of a secret, but it's not literature. That said, the more time I spend studying physics and chemistry—which I honestly can’t stand—the more I feel like I’m just enduring these subjects for the sake of keeping biology as an option. I don’t hate them, but I definitely don’t like them either. It often feels like I’m wasting my time and passion on subjects that don’t really resonate with me. I have written a few stories on certain platforms and they have gotten over thousands of views and a lot of appreciation from my readers. they said I have a big talent for writing.

Biology is my comfort zone, but every time I’m stuck with physics or chemistry, all I can think about is escaping back into my world of books—reading poetry, diving into classics, getting lost in novels, or even writing myself. If I could go back and choose again, I think I’d pick art and literature without a second thought. But I know that a degree in literature or arts doesn’t necessarily lead to a stable, high-paying job, and that's part of why I chose science in the first place.

I’m sticking with biology because it’s practical, but deep down, I know literature, poetry, and art will always hold a bigger place in my heart, maybe even bigger than biology. It’s hard balancing these practical decisions with my real passions. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How do you balance practicality with passion? There's still a chance for me to change my stream in 12th grade...but I really don't know.",4,0.7,7,theioneeee,2024-11-13 11:23:41,1gqi7hw,11,High
Confession,i lied about knowing how to drive and it backfired,"so when i was 18, i was hanging out with this group of friends who all had cars and would take turns driving everywhere. i didn’t have my license yet, but i was too embarrassed to admit it. so when they asked if i could drive, i just casually said “yeah, of course.”

big mistake.

long story short, i stalled the car immediately, and everyone started laughing because they thought i was joking. i tried to play it off like “haha yeah just messing with you guys,” but they quickly figured out i was clueless. it was SO awkward.

I'm not without flaws and I know I did alot wrong but I lost so many people and I didn't deserve it.

I feel so alone, I only really have one close friend now and as I feel my mental health get worse I know ive withdrawn and I'm scared If I loose her it would be the final straw, im at uni so theres distance and we never hang out irl, I want to be social again, I used to have friend groups and go out at least once a week, and now I haven't left the hosue in 2 weeks because i cant bring myself to.

Confession,I have a vivid images of offing myself everyday but I won’t do it.,"I think about killing myself almost everyday. I have this image that plays with me shooting myself and I honestly thinks it keeps me from offing myself. I have made lists of ways to do it and how I wouldn’t, but not a day goes by that I don’t think about it. When I was 15 I tried killing myself by downing ibuprofen pills,NyQuil anything I could get my hands on and genuinely went into kidney failure, I went to the hospital and they gave me fluids not knowing what could have caused such rapid failure. I never told anyone or the doctors at the hospital. I think about what would have went differently at the hospital if I did tell them what I tried to do, what my mother would have thought of me. I’m thankful to be alive but a part of me is so curious about what’s on the other side and lowkey scared if I do off myself   that I have to come back to earth and live again so I’d rather live out this life than live another one.

Confession,"Is my mom toxic or is this normal, I’m not sure what to even do","I live with my sister and a mom. I was really extroverted before when I was in elementary, but I changed because my mom started getting mad at me for how I dress, and how my hair looks. Not just that but she gets mad at me almost every single day almost like she is relieving her stress on me and she gets mad at me at the slightest things like not finishing my lunch or not praying before I eat and it spreads like a wild fire. She starts from why I didn’t finish my lunch to get out of house if you don’t wanna eat my food. This continues like every day and sometimes she even curses at me during I eat so I often just shit all the food out from anxiety after I eat. She doesn’t give me privacy, or let me save any money, she compares me to others, and she shouts at me for every mistake I said or did.

Confession,I had my first period and no one noticed even though I didn’t use sanitary products,"The same month I turned twelve, I had my first period. 

During that whole period (pun intended), there was a conference going on, which my parents and I were attending. My parents were part of the staff, so they were pretty busy. 

I started my period; but I wasn’t sure if it was actually a period, because I thought periods would be white and red, not just blood. The irony is that I had read a book or two talking about puberty, yet they clearly were not explanatory enough. I suspected it was a period, but I also thought the blood might be a pre-puberty type of discharge. I didn’t bleed too much. 

What makes things more interesting is I didn’t use any sanitary products. I did try to wear pads, but I quickly removed them since they were uncomfortable. I didn’t have access to anything else— though I doubt I would have used them. I’d heard that I’d drip all over the place if I used tampons. While at the conference, I’d keep checking to make sure I wasn’t leaking. I didn’t; I wasn’t bleeding enough for that. I put my laundry in the hamper with my parents’ clothes, hiding them a bit; but they were there and yet neither parent noticed.  

I didn’t have my next period for several months after that, but I told mom about that second one. We weren’t at home, so she came with me into the bathroom and checked my underwear and confirmed it was, in fact, my period. 

For years to follow, I felt very guilty for not telling my mom about the first one. I told her I’d started my period the same month as my birthday; but she insisted I’d started it several months later (the time I had my second period), because she only knew about the second time. I didn’t explain the whole truth to her, and I’ve left the matter entirely. 

Looking back, I know I made several bad decisions. But I definitely didn’t leak or spoil anyone else’s belongings. So I guess that’s that.

Confession,Having trouble controlling emotions I’ve had for a long long time,"So I’m 20 years old and my life hasn’t been easy to say the least. I was adopted at around 6 years old so being raised by different people wasn’t easy for neither them or us. I have 5 siblings, I’m the second oldest.

Nothing ever came of it, as far as I know he never told anybody, but as an adult I realize how traumatic and harmful what I did was.

We continued the rest of schooling together like nothing happened and we’re still friends on some social media. Should I reach out to apologize and try to make reparations?

Confession,"My parents inflicted their own traumas on me, now I have a personality disorder","When I was a kid my mom was ultra aggresive, she would find any excuse to demeanor me or be physically aggresive, my dad being the passive one in the relationship  would most of the time take my mother's side. I grew up feeling I couldn't stand up for myself because I it meant ""I was challenging my mom, defying her authority"" and as a man I was unable to touch a woman ""even with the petal od a rose"". I was obligated to apologize and to beg forgivness if necessary to their eyes. My dad is very soft which gave me a role model of 0 masculinity, all masculine traits came from my mother which was being aggresively reactive, toxic to the point that she would be a hardcore Karen.

Whenever I look at myself in the mirror I see the person my parents molded and Im unable to find myy true self, I feel traumatized, I was heavily into drugs, hardcore porn, Gore. I tried to prove my parents I am actually worth It by becoming a Chemical Engineer in one of the top Universities in my country, which wasn't enough so I always forced myself harder to be better faster stronger to the point of madness.

I have gone through heavy meditation, psyyychiatry, Psyychology and manyy more healing techniques. I'm unable to connect with people and I feel miserable.

I just needed to vent because in spite of all of this, myy parents in their own way have tried to give me the best life they could give me, so I feel like I cant feel bad, I'm being a bitch and a trash victim if I think like that, you know? I feel blocked like if I feel like something is wrong im being ungrateful and a piece of shit.

Confession,i lied about being allergic to pineapple for years,"ok so this started when i was like 10 and my mom kept forcing me to eat pineapple even tho i hated it. like, the texture, the taste, everything was just so gross to me. so one day i told her it made my throat itchy and she flipped out, thinking i was allergic. suddenly, no more pineapple. i thought i was a genius.

but here’s the thing: it got out of hand. my whole family started telling restaurants i had this ""severe allergy."" my friends at school knew about it and would avoid anything pineapple-related around me. i felt like i couldn’t backtrack without looking insane. i even started googling real allergy symptoms to keep my story straight.

fast forward to college, my roommate ordered a pizza with pineapple (gross) and was like “oh sorry i forgot about your allergy.” i was too embarrassed to admit the truth so i just sat there like “yeah thanks for the heads-up.” now i’m 24 and still living this lie. my boyfriend avoids pineapple completely and i can’t bring myself to tell him i just don’t like it.

sometimes i wonder how my life got to this point all because i didn’t want to eat pineapple as a kid. i think about coming clean but it feels too late. am i the villain here? idk man.",600,0.95,145,twilightxtide,2024-11-11 19:43:55,1gp9h1k,745,High

Confession,"I live with immense regret, and severe hatred towards my mother. (Trauma dump) ","I am 25(f), turning 26 next month. 
I am just now realizing that I likely have a pretty severe personality disorder. I also feel that I  am likely autistic, or just severely traumatized? I am having immense regret for the way I behaved as a whole as a young human from pre teens up to very early twenties. 

I come from an abhorrent & tremendously broken family, and an extremely traumatic early childhood. In retrospect I’ve been dealt a more fortunate hand than others, but I’m now seeing what a complete mess I was raised in. 

My mother is beyond emotionally immature and displays toxic narcissistic behavior regularly. She chose to have 2 children with an alcoholic, (my older brother and myself.) 
They made many reckless choices as young adults - (having children being one of them, for fucks sake?!) My parents divorced and my brother got killed in an ATV accident shortly after. He had raging adhd and was an impulsive adrenaline seeker, with a need for speed that killed him at age 13. I was 4 at the time, and both my parents became utter shells of humans. When my brother died he took every last ounce of light from my parents with him. This robbed me of so much throughout childhood, and left me completely neglected. 

I then struggled with actually every relationship by proxy, friendships, romantic relationships. I have a shit show of an attachment style, and shit emotional regulation. I find myself completely lacking in identity now that I am nearing 30. 

The worst part is now my parents finally seem to be starting to ‘heal’, (21 years too late may I add.) My body has kept score of all of their chaos - multiple auto immune diseases and now PCOS & infertility. My hormones are a wreck, and I’ve been labeled as having “disordered moods”, “major depressive disorder”, possible bipolar/cyclothymia. 

I can’t get over the fact that I have been the sole surviving child for 21 years now, yet I somehow remain completely invisible. I can’t even begin to imagine how to articulately express this to them, and I’m not sure it’s even worth it at this point. There is irreversible long term damage.

Confession,i used a fake accent for an entire semester        ,"ok so this happened in college when i was trying to “reinvent” myself. i was starting fresh in a new place, and for some reason, i thought it’d be fun to pretend i was from australia. like, full-on aussie accent. i don’t even know why i picked that—it just felt unique.

the first day of classes, i introduced myself in the accent, and people believed me. suddenly, i was the “cool international student,” and everyone kept asking me about kangaroos and if i’d been to sydney. i just rolled with it and googled stuff to keep my story straight.

it got out of hand so fast. i had to keep it up EVERYWHERE: in class, at parties, even on group projects. the worst part was when i ran into someone who actually WAS australian, and they asked where i was from. i panicked and said “melbourne” because that’s the first city i thought of.

eventually, i just stopped talking as much because i was scared i’d slip up. by the end of the semester, i started “losing” the accent and claimed i was picking up an american one from being here so long. i dropped it completely after that, but i still cringe every time i think about it.",86,0.92,16,spunky-sprite,2024-11-12 02:35:40,1gpga0k,102,High

Confession,Embracing the ‘WILL OF D’: My Promise to Rise Above,"I’m a 29M from a middle-class family who went through my share of challenges and setbacks. I studied Mechanical Engineering at a public trade college, earned an on-campus placement at one of India’s leading car manufacturing companies, and worked there for six years. Later, I pursued a Master’s in Business Administration with a focus on Operations Management. I came to Canada on my own, paying my own way, repaying every loan, and taking nothing from my family. I even shifted fields, studied Information Technology, but ended up back in a mechanical job as a CNC machinist, which supports my pathway to Permanent Residency here.

For five years, I’ve been with my girlfriend, who has stood by me back home and here in Canada. She has unwavering confidence in me—she would bet her life on me. But when we approached her family about marriage, they rejected us. They come from a more financially established background and looked down on me, thinking their daughter deserves “better.” To them, I’m just a guy from a humble background with nothing “special” to offer.

I’ve always been a grounded person, no show-offs, just focusing on working hard, respecting others, and staying humble. It hurt to be judged this way, but honestly, it fuels me even more. This isn’t a cry for sympathy or a plea for help—this is a declaration to the world.

One day, I will prove every single person who doubted me wrong. I will rise, succeed, and reach a place so high that they can’t even imagine it. I am driven to embody the “WILL OF D” in this world: I’ll keep working hard, up-skilling, and pushing forward no matter what. I’ll be richer, happier, and more successful than anyone who underestimated me. And I’ll do it without losing the values that got me here.

One day, I’ll come back to this post and tell you all—I did it.",20,0.89,9,Mindless_Edge7877,2024-11-11 20:11:06,1gpa0o9,29,High

Confession,We are not allowed to talk to boys in our jr college (pt1),"Not really a confession but a rant.

College Life and the ""No Talking to Boys"" Rule

So, my college has this unspoken (not really) but strict rule: boys and girls aren’t even allowed to be friends, let alone talk to each other. Just talking is seen as a huge deal.

For example, there was this girl, let’s call her Sam. She was seen talking to a 12th grader outside the college premises. The next day, the teacher publicly yelled at her, saying she’s not allowed to talk to boys—period—no matter who they are. And the worst part is, they actually ""spy"" on the students from the windows after classes to see if anyone is talking to the opposite gender and that's how they saw her.

Then, there’s another girl, let’s call her Mary. She lives in the same area as our class teacher and chemistry teacher. One day, they saw her coming home from extra classes in her college uniform with two boys who were just friends. They dropped her off, and the boys went on their way. But the very next day, the class teacher yelled at her for “hanging out with boys” and even threatened to tell her father. And this didn’t even happen at school—it was near their homes! Apparently, even outside school, it’s forbidden to talk to boys while wearing the uniform.

Another time, Mary was playing a game during recess and held hands with a boy for a second. Remembering the teacher’s reaction, she got nervous and pulled her hand back, telling him they aren’t allowed to do that. The boy was just as surprised and asked, “Can’t boys and girls just be friends?” That’s when our English teacher popped up out of nowhere and said, “No, in this college, boys and girls cannot be friends""

Confession,"I'm not my dad's kid but my siblings don't know, only some extended family","I can't go into much detail since I'm pretty sure one of my siblings do have reddit. Anyway, I was moving out of my parents when my mom sobbing told me that she needed to tell me one last thing before I left. I thought she was going to tell me that she knew I was abused when I was a kid, I braced myself to try to be open to talk to her. 

That's when she told me that my dad wasn't really my dad.

She asked if I knew and repeatedly told me that he does love me and took me as his own.AND TO NOT TELL MY SIBLINGS. I was in shock and confused. I've been told this before. First time being told that my dad wasn't my dad was by my cousin at the age of 5-6. She was also 5-6. ""You know, your dad isn't really your dad."" She told me. Upset at me over something I don't remember what about. I go to my mom crying and she told me she was just angry and to ignore her. I've been judged, picked apart, torn down, laughed at, and treated less than dirt by my dad's family for as long as I remember all while being told to ignore it or stay in the room. ""You don't look like your dad. You look like your mom. So ugly."" By my aunt. My dad's youngest sister. When I was 5-6. Every time I was told or it was insinuated to me that my dad wasn't my dad, I was told it was a lie. My mom told me twice herself. First time when I was 7-9. She told me I had another dad but he died from a scorpion sting. Then at a park we used to go to. She made me hug my dad and told him I loved him. That was maybe 10-13. When bringing it up later, she acted oblivious and adamantly said no. I was convinced I was dreaming.  

Now, she only brings it up when my dad or siblings aren't around. It's a ""big"" secret I can't tell them. My dad knows, he would just rather not know that I know. He cries to me when he's drunk telling me that he loves me. My real dad is dead. His brother was involved in some shady stuff and he was confused for him and was shot. She told me he wanted to see me and care for me. His family, I guess my family, wants so badly to meet me since I'm his only child. They send messages to my mom begging since I was a kid. Now I'm 22. I feel like I'm too old to be able to have a connection. Their is no first time anything to be involved in or to see. My childhood is gone.

Confession,I pretended to be working class during high school and college,"Title says it all. All of you have met a couple of people like me. Some are poor liars and get clocked, some are good liars and don't. I myself believe I flew under everyone's radar.

I'll be using the word ""rich"" very liberally here, as most people outside of reddit do. My family just hits the 95th percentile for household income in  my state, so, please, let's not get too obsessed with the semantics of ""rich"" vs ""upper middle class."" 

Rich people may pretend to be poor for a variety of reasons. Personally, my mom's side of the family is poor, and I always liked them way more than my dad's side of the family (they've been divorced since before I was born, so the distinction was always clear to me). When I watched school movies, the rich people were always assholes to the poor people, and kept making the poor people feel bad through flexing. My father didn't perfectly fit the stereotype, but he definitely saw himself as superior to people poorer than him, which I found to be awful. As I didn't want to be associated with this sort of rich person, I just pretended like I wasn't rich. 

During college, I met a lot of other people pretending to not be rich for different reasons: people who thought a non-rich backstory better described what their life had actually been like, people (all women) fearful that being rich would invalidate whatever they had gone through, people who thought being rich was shameful or immoral, etc. I also met a lot of undisguised rich people who fit the stereotype I had in my had, and a lot who didn't. 

With the exposure to people who also came from wealth but didn't act like complete assholes, my necessity to pretend I didn't come from wealth slowly was eroded. It also helped that I started seeing pretending to not be rich as something embarrassing. I didn't break character in college because the lie was already too big, but, after college, I put an end to the bit. 

Nowadays, I don't feel like there's any chance of me coming off as a boastful asshole, and all of that acting was really, really unnecessary. I could have just not acted as an asshole and I would not be associated with rich assholes. ",0,0.33,9,PlanePuzzleheaded132,2024-11-12 11:04:34,1gppks8,9,High

Confession,Life Of Gambler CEO. Life after Quitting Gambling ,"Hello Reddit Fam. it's my second post. 
Afte Quitting Gambling almost a week ago as I mentioned in last post Life is changing. In my experience of marketing I have learnt alot . Infact to fuel my gambling addiction I used to close clients but the problem was I used to charge very less or very little amount which can just fuel my account hoping to make it big . So most of the time what used to happen I lost but to cover my loss I had to make new client but in that process I used to miss my previous clients work,so sometimes they asked for refund also but luckily I had seen few good days in gambling which helped me to paid off .  Addiction was so bad that sometimes I have sold my laptops to play also bought it back but I did it multiple times. N that period was hell cuz laptop was my tool to make money. 
So now I have decided to do what I am good at. Before gambling I had very successful career,I have travelled multiple countries like digital nomad when it was not that popular also. I have also trained 1000+ students in multiple colleges on digital marketing. Infact from college which I dropped out I took a placement also there. So now I am gonna monetize those skills again.
 I am gonna share my weekly progress with you guys. Hope you guys will support me in this journey.",0,0.44,20,shriddemon,2024-11-12 05:13:08,1gpida2,20,High
Confession,There are no other words for that in the book that are used ,"There was something funny that happened recently!!
So me and my family drove out of state to meet some cousins. We stayed at a hotel.
Early in the morning the 3 of us decided to go eat breakfast somewhere. It was at this small restaurant. It was pretty crowded, lots of tables were taken. When we walked in this was the very first thing I noticed.
Everybody in the restaurant were white.
When I noticed that I started to feel uncomfortable. I felt like I was out of place or I didn't belong. And literally just as I was thinking about this, my dad leaned over to me and told me the same exact thing. We did get our tables and we saw one black guy at a different table. He was sitting with two other people and they were white. After I saw him I felt more comfortable. From where we were standing at the entrance, we didn't see him.

So I thought maybe I got the dates wrong and payment isn’t due yet.

Confession,"Met a girl at a school function, what should be the next steps I must take ","Hi, I am a teenager, Some days before I went to a school annual function, I saw a girl she was pretty cute,when I saw her for the first time we had an eye contact for a few seconds then out of shyness we both turned our face , and after an hour I found her sitting and enjoying the function and then the same eye contact thing happened , and then again after few hours when I thought she might have gone.


I decided to go see her again , She was walking towards the exit( btw she was with her mother) then i just walked really fast putting a fake call on my ears so that she doesn't find me creepy, then I walked passed her and turned back I saw her and We again had an eye contact for 4-5 second with intense smiling at each other.
 

From the past 3 days I have been in literal love at first site, The girl studied in a school just besides mine, but she completed the school 2 years ago. I somehow found her name her Instagram but she didn't accept my request and i again did some stalking and found out she isn't active on Instagram (probably). 


You might think I am exaggerating a simple thing but It was the first time happening to me and probably to her as well, as we both were in a only boys and only girls school respectively.


So what should I do next? Should I find mutual friends? BTW her school got a function too in the end of this month, I am not sure that she will come or not, So should I go there?

Confession,Willy the horse was a good fella and I put him out of his missery,"Willy was 21 when I met him. I worked on a ranch driving cattle and occasionally doing trail rides for tourists. Every morning I'd go catch horses for work and every morning I was told don't get Willy he's too old. Every morning he would come up and bite at the bridles I had, and it broke my heart. I knew I couldn't ride him I weigh 200 lbs and sometimes I had to go fast. However, I'd always put on a bridle and bring him on whatever my job was that day.

I loved Willy, I saw him every goddamn day and I brought him everywhere usually putting my bag on him. One day he stumbled and couldn't get up. I fed him the apple slices in my pack and pulled the trigger. He was tired and old. Making it to 21 is no easy feat for a horse, but ill always feel pain with that memory. 

Since then i served in the Army, I've seen and done things no one should. However, that memory is the only one that haunts. Not the dismembered children or burning bodies. It's his eyes looking at his only human friend pulling the trigger. I couldn't save him and I hate myself for it.

Hey guys, I've been dealing with this issue for a few weeks now and I can't seem to find a solution, so I came here. I (17f) broke up with my boyfriend (16m) back in April. Lets call him ray. There were alot of reasons for our breakup but the main ones were that he was really emotionally draining. He would never accept his fault and start blaming me and in order to manipulate me he'd do sh and send me pictures of it. Any minor argument would result into him saying ""okay I will go look for a knife now"" but somehow my dumbass thought that he'd change. I forgave him many many times but it all came down on me when I was scolling through reels on his ig account when I saw a message from his brother  (let's call him ryan) which was like ""did you seriously do that?"" or smth. I know, I shouldn't go through my bfs chats but I'm glad I did that time, Because apparently, Ray had forced his little cousin (girl) to cuddle with him and touched her, and he didn't just do that once but two or three times and the cousin was so traumatized from his actions that she went to his older brother, Ryan. I was disgusted as I read those chats, further in the chats, Ray kept saying that it was a mistake and he was quote ""blinded by porn"" and Ryan kept telling him that if he did something like this again then he'll tell their parents. But for me, I was done, a few days, I broke up with him, and he insulted me saying I never loved him and that I just wanted attention and not even 3 hours later he started begging me to take him back which I didn't, he stayed quiet for a month and then started texting my friends (after I blocked him) my bff told him too f off and shamed him for what he did to his cousin. He stopped after I also told him to not contact her but then on the 26th October, (which was the day he proposed me) he called me at sharp 12am, I knew it was him, it was obvious, I hung up and blocked his number. Then he called me again with two different numbers on 2 different dates. And send me a video on my number too (which I never opened) and he still keeps calling. I am not in the state to talk to him at all, I'm already stressed with my exams and college and he won't stop. A mutual friend who follows him on ig says that he keeps posting stories about me.

Confession,Regaining custody and breaking out of mental health,"So Ive been getting calls from the county of statements from my own son and he is only 5 stating that his dad hits him let alone hits my daughter who happens to be autistic and is 7 yrs old. But he wants sole custody. Is not gon happen. Read up on articles or on googles. Now these days the court will not favor mothers but the safety of the kids.
 
He don't even have a place of his own he lives w his sister. And he be stating to the court I have some mental status. Which he gave out the wrong diagnosis. So w that being said and thru out his statement against me. He has no proof. And to put out a misdiagnosed where did he get that. Cuz isn't there in violation of HIPAA and the PHI or so. So he ain't got shit on me. And if the court wants to focus on the safety of the kids.

I have proof against him. As well as working and getting my stuff documented. Going to clinics and getting a reevaluation. Being on corrected meds. As well as seek therapy.

His mom pulled up an attempted kidnap back in 2019 when my daughter was only 2 yrs old and my son just about 9 months at the time.

From day 1 of the birth of my daughter (2017) he slacked on dad duties I know because he always brought his mom and sister. But why for something so simple like to pick up and drop off my daughter at school. Why when she rode the school bus that literally her stop was in front of the house. So u mean to tell me the kids mom drove from her town (45min) just to pick my daughter up from school so she can take her to school the next day. Oh but than they had to wake up around 5 am just to get her ready. And second my daughter was losing sleep. For a kindergartner to lose sleep because his mom claimed she was helping when the bus to my daughter was literally at our front door. And than his mom had the audacity to complain she's tired ok than why volunteer when I personally did not ask for the help because my daughter had her bus right in front of the house. And that's just one several events that brought all this for him to request custody. 

I be doing the aba therapies w my daughter whether it be on zoom or in person. But yet he brings his mom and sister to over step me as I'm the mother. As if I don't exist when in reality I was always present. The only thing I was lacking was what a car of my own. So where was the kids dad to assist me in that. Why couldn't he of done that as a dad but yet he kept bringing his mom. As if he was mentally documenting for his mom to have that parental rights. Everything just seems to add up.

Than as my son got older they wanted to separate my kids.

Anyways, if the kids dad didn't want to partake in any of the parental duties as Dad and just fork it over to his mom. Than why even be in there lives.

If the court wants it in favor for the safety of the kids. Than I will fight for my rights as well as fight for custody he can't get sole custody.

The county be calling me numerous times of our son putting on accounts that he hits both kids. Apparently he be doing this behind my back while I'm working. Cuz the dad never showed or raised a hand to the kids when Im present.

But things are starting to show on clear. There have been other course of events that lead up to these. And I will take a stand for my kids. I already am gathering information as well as documenting them.

I've been dealing w mental issues before I even met his ass. Growing up and me myself an adopted child who was brought to america. As well as in that home I experienced domestic violence, mental and verbal abuse. 

And than about a year or two after I graduated highschool my adopted family kicked me out. I had no where to go.. I ended up getting raped. So yeah that added more mental shit in my mind. But years passed and I moved on from that trauma.

But w this shit the kid dad pulling on me as if he mentally fucked me over, whether it be mentally or emotionally. Looking back me and him were just coexisting and no communication. As if we were just putting a facade in front of people we knew. But I knew like I said from day 1 of my daughter arrival from the delivery room back in 2017 as something was going to happen. And now everything is being clear.

So yes I will fight for my kids and get them away from there dad. As well as get the help that he claims I need. And that I'm already handling to get reevaluated and being on corrected meds.

Confession,I once did a number 2 in while inner tubing and it haunts me still,"When I (25f) was 17 I went to visit my sister (21 at the time) out of state for a week during the summer. She had plans to go tubing with a group of friends during the time I was there, so I tagged along. It was a several hour long tubing trip down a long and wide river. We were all drinking, and at one point I realized I really had to take a dump. I kind of panicked a little, and I asked my brother in-law what I should do, because I knew I couldn’t have the whole group pull off and stop to wait for me to poop and I didn’t want to get left behind as I had no idea where the campsite was we were gonna be stopping at. He very nonchalantly (and drunkly) told me to just pull back real quick and go in the river. So I got just far enough behind to pull off to the side so I could inconspicuously pull my swimsuit to the side and drop a couple logs while still kind of floating down the river. It was a clean one and I went about the trip hardly even thinking of it. But now, it kind of haunts me. 

Edit: Certianly did not expect this to garner so much attention!

Confession,He’s 26 I’m 17. I sorta lied about how old I really am! ,Hello! I’m taking to Reddit to confess. I have no where else. Just to get it out of the way I’m 17 years old and my boyfriend is 26. He thinks I’m 18. I lied because right off the bat he told me he was 25 and was trying to make sure I wasn’t a minor or anything like that. I’m a liar by default i immediately told him I was 18 turning 19 soon so he could actually take me seriously and feel better knowing I’m not a minor. Keep in mind i honestly never thought we would be together the way we are I thought he maybe just wanted to fool around and smoke some weed but we’re 6 months in things are getting serious. It’s at the point in relationships where we both want to introduce each other to our families and stuff but I’m scared of what everyone is gonna think when they find out how old he is. My 18 birthday is right around the corner and this lie is weighing on me. I lie about my age very often I graduated early from high school and I’m in my second year of college it’s something I lie about so people don’t think of less of me cause they really do when they find out my real age. I must say i definitely don’t act my age my parents aren’t around and I’ve been what feels like on my own for a while. Besides that I really love this guy and I really fucked up by lying but if I didn’t lie we wouldn’t be together. He turned 26 recently and the longer I’m with him the more and more it dawns on me that he’s just old he’s already graduated from college and trying to pursue bigger things and I just got out here.

Confession,'They' are investigating me and my lies have more or less buried me deep,"I'm currently under investigation and have been more or less for a while.

They've been contacting essentially everyone I know. My employers or potential employers, coworkers, etc.

That isn't bad in itself, however, the bad part is the consequences of this. I've lost at least 3 jobs that I know of directly due to this investigation and it has caused multiple other instances of conflict in my life.

The problem isn't the investigation itself. The problem is they're offering a cash reward for 'any' information regarding me. It's turning people who I've had good relationships with against me for petty cash. I'm talking about coworkers starting drama, bosses trying to have me do illegal things, and friends, family, and partners turning against me.

They're telling people that I'm under investigation for shit I swear I didn't do, but what they've resorted to is aggressively trying to get ""evidence"" basically saying I'm a terrible person. They hope to try to go in front of a jury saying how ""terrible I am"" instead of proving I did what they're telling people (and I mean it's bad). The point that they contact these people, within a couple of weeks to months, a good relationship turns sour. Relationships that have been good and stable for years suddenly turn terrible.

It's ruining my life before I've ever had the chance of standing trial and there isn't anything I can do. It's been going on for so long too. I'm nomadic at this point. I have very short-term friendships or relationships and the stress of having virtually 0 privacy is pushing me to the absolute edge.

How do I know? The following isn't an exhaustive list but it contains some pretty good tells.

1. Informants using bad information. Some of my online presence hasn't been what I would say is accurate. Like Joji vs Filthy Frank kind of personas. Flat-out, I've had people ask and assume questions of me in the vein of Filthy Frank when I'm Joji irl. The assumptions are very specific and stick out like a sore thumb and it's very easy for me to notice when people are dealing with such specific information. ALSO LET THIS BE A WARNING. They're going to try to use that against me so, you know, don't play Filthy Frank online for kicks if you don't want the feds treating you like Filthy Frank even though we can talk about free speech all we want to.
2. Good relationships go sour very quickly. Case in point, a girl I'm seeing. We've been fine for the past 2 years but she recently moved into a new place. The next time I saw her (a few weeks later) wouldn't you know it. We went from okay to her talking some absolute fucking trash the entire time. They have a ground surveillance crew on the look more or less. I'm not a high-value target but they're very interested in seeing what my whereabouts are. Nothing I can do to stop that without having to start acting weird around people. Considering getting a burner though so they're a little less in my life yah know?
3. Therapists trying to collect unusual details of my life. Sort of like guiding the conversation into non-standard places or denying certain issues I have based on information that they either shouldn't have access to or is flat-out wrong. For example, I had my therapist say ""Keep acting intentionally"". There was one moment when I was talking to myself in my bedroom when I was talking about the intentionality of what I was doing. I have a surveillance camera in my room due to some prior bad roommates it's also a way I inject some absolute trash into their ""intelligence"" stream, I'm also a kingpin, hacker, international spy, etc whatever is convenient for them to believe. I likened it to being clumsy or causing a car accident. It was a specific thing with me but, if you don't know the whole story, you can't know the whole story. This BS has more recently been creeping into my life but has been in bits and bobs for a while, lol. Surveillance camera warrants in private places are very hard to get (let alone CCTV warrants) so I'm wondering how they'll try to protect that ""confidential source"", lol.
4. Old family/friends coming out of the woodwork to get statements from me. They got a wiretapping warrant sometime a few years ago so I've gotten some weird calls with people asking me some weird questions. Not a chance in hell they didn't think I wouldn't notice that.
5. Informant roommates: Overly invasive roommates that aren't standard fair for the lot. Easy to pick out and easy to tell them things and watch who else repeats that bullshit. Try to avoid them and they'll make sure they make contact with you.
6. People who can't mind their business. It's more irritating than anything but these guys are ruthless. Any ounce of privacy I have they just continue to degrade.
7. Break-ins and items stolen. I've had my documents stolen. The informant roommates keep shutting off the power in the house and messing with my food (especially bad since the last roommate). It's a mess but basically, my entire space is being tampered with/bugged/etc. Talk about no privacy.

Well, I know who to call and talk to if this ever goes to court. If they're talking some absolute trash they could throw their case away on that alone. They're a little pompous, but it's okay. Their win rate at trial is 60% in practice. State courts are like 50%. I still like those odds, lol.

  


I'm guilty of lying to them about who I am and it's eating me alive. It's so difficult to know this. The harassment they've put me through is ridiculous so I decided that I was going to give them ""everything"" and more. If they had a case, I think they would've pulled the trigger on it right now. Anything within the past 5 years that I could've done wasn't something the feds would want to try and do this bullshit with. My issue is that I've given them and a lot of people around me false information so I could figure it all out. Around 6 years ago I had some very interesting interactions with people that made me think I was under investigation. It kept getting pushed and pushed until the stress was too much for me to deal with. I started lying through my teeth about small things, big things, and all things in between. My personas online were features of toxic features I was fighting to not believe in or they were just to piss people off. I was a bit of a troll but also used it as a way to get the negativity off my chest that even a therapist couldn't handle.

Ultimately my lies online and to others are going to be the death of me even though none of it is true.",0,0.33,61,Budget_Tomatillo_891,2024-11-11 15:56:25,1gp4ex8,61,High
Confession,I don't have friends and can't make any no matter how hard I try,"I am a 21F who struggled with severe social anxiety for 19 years. It was not in the avoiding crowds/social interaction way but struggling with 1:1 contact with people and making friends. I recovered 2 years ago thanks to medication and kinda pushing myself but since then I didn't manage to build any connection with people. I don't stay passive but also try not to be pushy or imposing. I often start conversations, propose plans, try to show people genuine interest and care. I help people a lot (i think sometimes I am too good and being a people pleaser is my big issue). As a person I take care of my hygiene and looks, maybe I am not the prettiest but my appearance is def not something that would make people avoid me etc.

My issue is, that even though I am a non-conflict type of person, don't talk shit about anyone, I am not weird at any sense I am still alone. I am never texted first, never invited (only if i ask if i can join...), never included, people make plans behind my back, respond to my messages after days... in bad times I struggle to find anyone to help me with basic stuff, not mentioning hard times when I need support. I often get stood out or people agree to meet and then tell me like one hour earlier that they can't come and make such stupid excuses which in 99% are not true. When I meet new people and interact with them at like parties/events and feel like we vibe they never reach out again and when I do they never want to maintain the contact.

Any tips what I might be doing wrong? Howcome people from pathological environments, or people who are fake/rude/not interesting or intelligent at all etc. have friends and I can't make even one friend?

Confession,I have an intense hatred of young deer and I don't know why,"

I love animals. I love viewing nature documentaries/programs and I follow a bunch of nature related subreddits But as of recent I have somehow developed an intense animosity towards baby deer (particularly whitetail and mule deer ) and adult does ( females)to a lesser extent .Whenever I see videos of them I just fantasize of killing them in front of its mom. I often feel frustrated watching them being rescued from dire situations (being stuck in a fence or net). I also frequently search for videos of them being attacked and torn apart by predators, preferably bears as they  don’t typically kill their prey before consuming it so I can watch the fawn scream in agony as it’s being eaten alive while the mother watches helplessly. I of course get disappointed when the mother or even human saves them from a smaller predator like a coyote, bobcat, domestic dog or even a skunk(yes a skunk I recall watching a video where a skunk is attacking a fawn until the camera man scared the skunk away, much to my disappointment.) .I really hope I never see one because I'm not sure if I would control my urges. The least I could do to it would be to rub my scent on it to increase the likelihood of it being discovered by a predator(the mothers groom their babies until they're scent free then hide them in tall vegetation for most of the day). I’m truly sorry if this posts disturbs any of you but like I said this feeling just developed out of nowhere within me.",0,0.4,64,Primary_Flower_4308,2024-11-11 18:21:19,1gp7qp2,64,High

Confession,I'm the worst 31yo—disguised as the best. And I'm tired.,"This is my maiden attempt at expressing myself. The anonymity is ofcourse making me feel safe. But I can still feel my chest thumping with fear. I don't know what I'm seeking out of this. Probably an outlet for the guilt I've been sheltering for the past 15 years.

Here goes:

I was introduced to porn when I was 16. I haven't been able to quit ever since. 
With porn came fapping. I continue to do it several times a day for the past 15 years now. 
I've been married for the past three years. But I still consume porn and jerk off to it. 
I've been late to official meetings, gatherings and meetups because an interesting porn video came up and I had to do something about it. 
There have been days where I've jerked off in the office washroom and gone back to my desk.
I've never been a creep to women, as far I can judge, but all the porn and fapping has really messed up my head in the way I look at them.

Then there's a second addiction. I was introduced to smoking and smoking up when I was 22. And the last time I smoked pot was yesterday. I don't remember the last time I didn't smoke a joint in a day. I also finish atleast 3-4 cigarettes in a day. Sometimes my chest hurts and throat itches. My lips have turned dark grey because of the continuous smoking. But I just don't stop. I hate it. But soon my brain justifies the act and I'm back to looking for my lighter.

And ofcourse with such an addictive personality, alcohol couldn't be far behind. On average, I drink thrice a week. Every session is 375ml of whiskey. I feel amazing when I'm drunk. I'm able to talk better, sing better, think better, emote better and eventually crash better. 

But it's not as if I'm completely miserable in life. On the outside, people think I'm an amazing person. I've been doing pretty well in my career of 8 years. I'm far ahead of my college mates in terms of remuneration, respect in the industry and overall work. They think I'm a patient listener, honest and warm. 

But I know I'm a pathetic man, struggling with every addictive habit that he picks up. And the career growth is just a farce to veil the nasty life behind it. I can't remember the number of times that I've tried to quit all three habits in the past. I've only failed and I continue to fail.

That's probably the real me: a grand failure in the disguise of an accomplished man. And trust me, I'm tired as fuck! ",91,0.81,92,Own-Media-3894,2024-11-10 01:56:52,1gnvq0n,183,High
Confession,I used a random man i met for weed and broke his heart,"I was walking home from the gym a few weeks ago and i stopped by some benches outside, this guy who we’ll call Matt was in my usual spot so i sat a bit away from him, smoked a cig and went to walk past to go home where i smelt he was smoking some weed. He called out to me and complimented my looks and asked to sit with him. I thought to myself why not, he’ll probably share some smoke with me and he did. We had a pleasant convo about life and he said he would help me with my business so i gave him my number and I went home.

Now here is the context. I am lesbian so i have no attraction to guys, however at the time i was feeling sexually curious and wanted to know what it was like to be sexual in some way with a man because i had never done that before, also im an avid weed smoker so two birds with one stone.

Eventhough i gave him my number i pretty much ignored him for a week, i ignored his calls and texts, until i felt like having a bit of a smoke and exploring sexually. Exactly a week later, i call him and ask him to meet me at the previous spot. We meet and smoke. 

Here he tells me that he has feelings for me and sees a future with me and he’ll never cheat on me etc. this is my second time meeting the guy and the previous week we spoke for no longer than 45 minutes so I’m not taking him seriously.

After i ask to go back to his and i give him a bj, after he buys me weed and i go home.

The next day i text him that we cant be together because im gay and i just wanted to know what it felt like to give a bj. Honestly it was incredibly underwhelming and I’ll probably never do it again.

Its been 2 weeks since then and yesterday i call him up ask him to meet at the spot and to bring stuff to smoke and the vibe was incredibly awkward.

He then tells me he was thinking about what i texted him and i tell him what i said was true. And i look at him and he just looks so sad, while im talking he goes ‘its okay its okay’ like he’s trying to reassure himself and it looks like he’s trying not to cry. I smoke a little with him but at that point im like its time to go. So i say im going home, he says okay. Im probably going to block him now. I honestly dont feel that bad because he had only really met me three times and doesn’t know me, i think the previous time he met he was telling me how he loves me and stuff but how could he if he doesn’t know me.",0,0.38,45,NeighborhoodWise1410,2024-11-11 12:39:49,1gozjj2,45,High
Confession,I’m the one who crashed the company car and got away with it.,"Many years ago, I worked for a company with random drug tests. Upon hire, I stopped smoking weed which was a bummer but whatever. After a couple years without testing I asked around and found out that the company was cheap and would only test upon hire or if there was a workplace incident (injury or significant equipment damage). Great, that week I smoked my first joint in years and that Friday I was given a company car with a brand new wrap on the sides to see a vendor. Pulling out of the vendors building, I took the turn too tight and scraped the entire right side against it ripping off most of the wrap and causing major dents and scratches. Oh god oh shit. This is a drug test incoming 100%. I drive back to work and park the bad side against the wall. Two weeks later ownership comes asking “WHO FUCKED UP THE NEW CAR?!”. Well between me wrecking it and their discovery, 12-15 people had used it and since it was on the passenger side, no one had seen the damage. They were too cheap to drug test all of us so it went away. Months later, this old guy Tommy who I shared an office with ducks his head in as he’s leaving. “I know you’re the one who fucked up the car”. I asked him what he was talking about. “Jake, (the vendor) me and him are buddies. He’s got cameras and he saw it. We all think it’s pretty funny”. Then he just goes home. I hadn’t smoked again since but it’s still fireable so I’m freaking out. Thankfully Jake and Tommy never said a word and they both passed away recently so I can finally say I’M THE ONE WHO CRASHED THE COMPANY CAR (WHILE SOBER).",226,0.93,31,BookerCatchanSTD,2024-11-09 20:32:25,1gnqjhm,257,High

Confession,I know i am fooling myself and have repressed myself too long.,"Hi
I am 23F, i talk less and don't go out much. I recently started talking to a boy, it's new to me. I have talked to boys before but never as a friend. My family is spritual and so i am groomed similarly. Relationships and all these are taught as wordly pleasures and that i must not indulge in this. This has become my mindset too.
 
So after 20 days i stopped talking to this guy. And for 2 months it was all i was thinking. And so i texted him again and explained him my thoughts he understood me.  He is a good person and extrovert and real passionate. Today we talked and he told me i should not repress myself and live my life normally. He said i wouldn't have texted him back if i didn't want these things and relations too. Although it hurt me but i know this was going in my subconscious when i texted him. 

I have these spritually high morals about my actions and thinking and see all the things from this cloured glasses. 
 
But now when this repressed me is coming out how can i accept this. I am afraid I'll be duped like all the people and become miserable like all the failed relationships I've seen in my life or heard of.

Please help and guide me out of this.

Confession,"i was the middle creme of a mff sandwich, threesome story below~","Tl;dr I was in the middle of a slut sandwich, & I loved every second  
  
Started talking to a couple from Reddit (of all places) about meeting for some play. There was mutual interest and we talked about going out for drinks to meet up and go from there  
  
Well fast forward a couple weeks no contact, last night they said hi. Lately I've been lonely AF too and so I let my desires do the talking, ""Want to come see me?""  
""Yesss, I can host""  
  
Inv two moderately unknown people to my apt, like they now have my address. But I can't resist, finding out what's in store~ and they're driving from an hour away.  
  
They brought alcohol and their cute butts 🥰 the convo flowed and before I knew it pants were off (mine were off when they arrived~) and she was going down on him, enthusiastically at that!  
  
Many kisses and positions later, he was inside me while I was inside her (I am trans!) in a doggy train. His thrusts into me guided my movements, like he was filling both of us up simultaneously.  
  
She collapsed into the couch in front of me. I held onto her soft body for support as he's giving me every inch.  
  
And tbh my brain kinda blanked out here as we all moaned together in a mesh of flesh, heat, and orgasmic pleasure.  
  
I've had previous threesome exp but nothing like this. Afterglow still got me beaming clearly as I wrote this entire piece for your reading pleasure 🤭 hope u enjoyed~",0,0.35,7,Opening-Weekend-8452,2024-11-11 12:59:32,1gp01jc,7,High
Confession,I had my first breakdown after spending the last 2 days vandalizing ,"
18m. I usually suppress my emotions and hate crying cause I was raised to see it as weakness.

Long story short, failed relationships, financial issues, super bad distancing with my parents and my older sister who hates all of us completely. Only the last few days I have been acting out out of nowhere.

At about 9pm my sister came downstairs and mentioned “you look homeless and that shirt you’re wearing used to be mine” because i’ve been sick for a month and was wearing an old shirt she gave me 2 years ago.

Usually I wouldn’t care at all but it angered me so much (i was having a bad day) and left. I went to my old school and threw a bunch of coke bottles on the black top until they exploded, and then I climbed the school and after an hour, slept in my car at a hotel lot. I turned my location off for my family too. 

I can’t explain why I did it. I was so angry at my family, myself, and the world around me. Feel like I’m kinda empty and I can’t fulfill a purpose. All I do when i can is climb buildings at night. It’s like an escape for me

My parents know something is wrong and ask me but I do not tell them. They always argue and I cannot stand to even speak with them. I pretended I was too tired to go to church at 9am today so I could go alone to a different church at 11am.

At 10am, I left my home and went to walmart to buy something. As I was leaving my car, I noticed my new polo I had just bought last week had a small hole in it. I don’t know why, but I immediately just started banging on my steering wheel, sobbing and just shouting “damn it” over and over again. I’ve never done anything like that in years (crying like that) and I keep replaying it in my mind

At church, I was so angry the entire time and I saw someone who pissed me off. To summarize, she is the head who refused to let me back into the young adult group for my church because she doesn’t like my personality. As soon as church ended, I found her car and threw about 5 pieces of chewed gum on it. I drove off and drifted in the church lot tonight. 

I know I shouldn’t do it, and I’m irritated at myself for continuing to vandalize stuff and be in places I shouldn’t be. I don’t have anyone else to tell this and I’m angry with myself and my life. Any response, positive or negative would help loads ",2,0.56,17,DaveLevey78,2024-11-10 21:08:22,1goihlj,19,High
Confession,I have been wearing duct tape bras instead of real ones all week,"I have huge boobs. So if i sleep on my side the wrong way sometimes i wake up and my chest hurts. I slept so badly the ofher day that i think i pulled a muscle in my chest. When i woke up it hurt so bad that i couldn't even move my arm/shoulder to get out of that position.

My chest right over  my sternum had been sore and only getting worse for a few days. Every movement of my arms hurt and especially any movement of my boobs hurt. If my boobs moved or shifted even in my bra, they pulled on my chest and caused some pain. Even though bras support me gravity still works and boobs kind of act like a liquid in a bag, so they moved enough to cause pain. I found that if i held my boobs while bending over/walking my chest didn't hurt. 

Out of desperation i grabbed duct tape and hit my boobs with like 10 layers and i have never been so comfortable. No band digging into my back and no straps cutting into my shoulders and no boobs pulling on my chest uncomfortably. It also looks fine with a shirt on do i have worn this to work. It looks psychotic without a shirt lol. The tape is mildy irritating to the skin but it's still less painful. I either shower the tape off or sweat it off by the end of the day. Obviously this isn't a permanent solution but it is working.
.


Edit: thanks for all the awards and advice! While i appreciate all the offers for boob tape i am no longer in need, I've felt great the last few days and have had no pain! A lot of people recommended reduction which i would love to do but there are numerous reasons why im not considering it at the moment but it is something I've always dreamed of.

Here is an image (not of me) demonstrating how i applied the tape. Hope this clears some things up

Confession,I was mole*ted as a young girl; my reflections on it.,"When I was a 11 I was sex*ually touched by a family member. At the time I didn't think much of it, and truthfully it didn't bother me. 

Only when I turned 14 did I begin to question if this was normal. When I approached my parents to innocently ask them, my mother was quick to warn me to stay quiet about this situation.
Very soon after that the touching stopped.

I continued to see this relative at family gatherings and functions, we didn't have any tension between us. 
Nothing that occured had seemed to negatively affected me.

Today, I am an adult, wife and mother with a family. My reflections on those younger years are actually fond.

Without trivializing those with different experiences in similar situations, I find that my situation helped me grow into a very sexually active and healthy woman.",0,0.39,25,ReallyMarriedWife,2024-11-11 09:14:16,1gougq9,25,High
Confession,I’m gambled away the inheritance my now deceased grandparents left me. ,"When my grandfather (dad’s father) passed away, I received $5,000.00 I was 21 at the time (currently 45), it was a significant amount of money for me at the time. His passing was devastating to me as I was very close to him and had always admired and looked up to him. Rather than using the money for purchasing something or investing it, I spent on VLTs. Then in 2015 my grandmother (dad’s mom) passed and I received just over $21,000.00 when her house was sold, my siblings received an equivalent amount. I used a portion of the money to pay off a debt and then went to a casino and in two days had blown the remainder of it which was about $18,000.00 I felt absolutely terrible, disgusted and ashamed of myself for what I did. My grandparents were extremely hard working people, sacrificing to give their children and family grandkids a better life. In return I was selfish and didn’t fully appreciate what I had received. 

I have never told my dad or mom about either instance, although I am sure they know I spent or blew the money as I had borrowed from them numerous times. 

My gambling addiction has been the cause of so many problems in my life and many days I feel like taking my life. I made an attempt once but thankfully a Good Samaritan called an ambulance and I was rushed to an ER. I don’t want to die but living with this shame and guilt is awful 😞

relationships,"UPDATE: I've [F23] been in love with my best friend [M21] since I first met him. It's not going away, and I don't know how to deal with it because I have no idea if he likes me, and it's stopping me from meeting someone else. (Now F28, M27)","Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b4ivgs/ive\_f23\_been\_in\_love\_with\_my\_best\_friend\_m21/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b4ivgs/ive_f23_been_in_love_with_my_best_friend_m21/)

So, hello. A little over five years ago I made a post on this subreddit looking for advice on how to handle my incredibly painful unrequited love for my best friend. I'd honestly forgotten about this until making a password reset on another account, and saw ""tobz13"" among my email search results. But as I read through the post, I remember how very comforting and terrifying the responses to my post was, being a more or less unanimous ""ask him out"" that scared my ass to death. Sorry that this isn't really a happy update, but... I don't know. It felt weird seeing something I wrote in what feels like a different life, and the people who responded seemed so genuinely kind and trying to help, I feel like I weirdly owe some kind of update?

Especially for that one, dear, sweet commenter whose account is now deleted. I so wish I'd have a way to reach out to them, because that was one of the most thoughtful comments I think I've ever gotten.

And just to recap, with hindsight: I really, really was in love with this man and I had been for about two years. Like, full nine yards in love. Struggling to breathe when he talked about someone else but still cheering him on because he deserved happiness-levels of in love. If that sounds a bit like obsession to you, then that's because it probably was.

The thing about unrequited love, the thing that really sucks about it, is that it's incredibly hard to move on from, but until you do move on, your brain keeps obsessing about it to the point where it can be impossible to get anything done. It had been two years of that when I made that post, two years of pining and pain and an ever-growing pile of crushed hopes, and I think I was going a little bit insane, constantly swinging between butterflies and love highs when I was with my friend and the crushing feeling of rejection every time he'd say goodbye. And the obsession over things like how long he'd look at me, how long he'd let a hug last, how fast he'd respond to my texts, things which could either make or break my entire day depending on what the answer was.

Onto the actual update, after that primer. About a month and a half or so after I made that post, still trying to hype myself up to actually ask this man out, I accidentally became a head organiser for an event at the university I was studying at for the moment. Long story short, the person managing me was Not Kind, I was extremely overworked from the event on top of writing a thesis, I was equally stressed out in my private life due to the whole situation with my best friend, and I ended up going through a pretty severe case of burnout. 

Add onto everything that I'd developed an addiction to alcohol to try to handle everything, and was also experiencing what was most likely a drug-induced paranoid psychosis, and I was a mess.

I ended up moving back in with my dad in September, and spent about a year doing nothing but sleeping, crying, playing Skyrim and going to rehab and therapy. Start of 2021, I went back to school, and slowly recovered. I've been sober since 2020, the paranoia hasn't completely gone away but it's more manageable (I used to think my landlord listened to me through a radon measurement device, and at least that's over), and I think I've got a work-life balance figured out that helps me not overwork myself or go into freetime lethargy because I've got too much time off. It was long, and painful, but I did it.

If you're wondering where my best friend was in all of this, I... Honestly don't know. I went back to look at our text messages, and from what I can see he tried to call me a few times in early September, I didn't respond, and then nothing until around Christmas when he wondered if I wanted to meet up sometime. I said yes, and then never followed through. He hasn't texted me since january 4th, 2020.

Now, to be clear, I don't blame him for not reaching out more. My non-responding is what killed that friendship. I know, because it also killed every other friendship I had at the time. I don't know, ""alcohol addiction, deep depression and crippling paranoia"" may be a fair *explanation* to one day stop responding to any of your friends, but I still deeply regret those choices. If I were to make a relationships post today, it would be on how the fuck you word an apology after behaviour like that, five years down the road.

Sorry. I feel like this is starting to become a journal. I'm gonna stop my reflections there. So, about my 'love' for my best friend, with some years of hindsight and therapy behind me:

I don't think I was in love with him. I think I was in love with the idea of him, and I think I was obsessed for sure, but looking back... I don't know. I genuinely don't know. I think a part of me really liked the fact that this was a person who so clearly wasn't interested in me (genuinely, if he was, that would *shock me* to find out, because he spent two and a half years ignoring the in hindsight VERY OBVIOUS attempts I made to deepen the relationship. Some examples include:

* him saying he's waiting for the right person, me responding ""sometimes I feel like I already have. Do you ever feel like that?"" and him going ""nah, I don't think so""
* me following that up with ""maybe you just don't know, the heart is weird sometimes"" and him going ""i'm pretty sure i'd know.""
* one time we talked about why people fall in love, and I genuinely tried to convince him a deep friendship was all you needed, while he insisted that there needed to be a level of sexual attraction as well.
* I tried to get him to do that ""36 questions that will make you fall in love"" thing with me.
* I kept trying to find excuses to hold his hand (rest in peace, my palm reading career, you were nothing but a thinly veiled attempt at finger touching) and him resolutely never going along with it
* Ditto, but with hugs, arm touching, and sitting just a little too close whenever we went out so I could ""hear him better"", which he normally responded to by going ""we should go outside so you can hear better if it's too loud in here"". Very thoughtful, but very much not what the goal was.
* one night, when we were alone in my apartment after a club event, after a particularly long shared Look, I asked him what he was thinking about in that kind of ""i don't want to break the illusion"" soft voice you put on when you're really fucking close to someone you like, and his response was ""I don't know if I agree that Geertz's metaphor about blinking makes that much sense, actually"".
* (For context, we'd bickered about that earlier in the night, since we'd just read some article about it in class. I did not expect it to make a comeback at that point.)
* Another night, when we were out together and there had been a lot of Looks and closely-leaned-in laughing together, and he pulls me to one side by the hand to talk to me about something, heart racing, only to ask me if I know if one of my friends is single because he thinks she's really fucking cute and might have been looking at him all night)

Looking back, at least some of this stuff is sort of funny.  I have no idea if he knew, or knows now, that I was in love with him. I wouldn't be surprised if some of my old friends eventually told him, but of course he's never reached out about it.

But yes, I think I kinda liked the security of this person who clearly didn't like me back. Not that I was doing well with the heartache, but there's a certain kind of fucked-up comfort that comes from pining for someone who doesn't want you back. Like, the highs I'd get when I got something that felt like 'confirmation' made up for the lows of crying in my apartment stairway when I got home after a 'denial'.

Today, I mostly just feel so bad for him and ashamed of myself. Regardless of whether he knew or not, and I'm trying to cling to the fact that he seemed to at least continue wanting to be friends as some indicator that he never felt creeped out or uncomfortable, my behaviour was pretty fucking creepy. And in the end, once I did get that distance between us, the feelings went away after some six months or so. My therapist recommended not meeting this person again, for my own sake, and by early 2020 I wasn't so painfully in love anymore.

A while later I'd end up meeting a guy I clicked with just as much, who actually liked me back and showed it. We've been together for almost three years now, and are talking about starting to try for kids at some point soon. He'd like us to get married first, but is also insisting he wants to be the one to propose so I'm just walking around waiting for the day. Even if it's not a huge surprise or secret, he just wants to get that moment of going down on one knee, and who am I to deny him.

I'm slowly growing old and boring. I'm sober, I go to my boring, stable, middle career 9-5 job, I save for my retirement and travelling on the summers, I help my dad out on his farm, I crochet little animals for my newborn niece. I come home to a man who plays his silly videogames, I play my silly videogames, we go for walks and to the museum and bicker about whether to get fat on takeout or not. I have some regrets about how my early 20s ended up playing out, but by god, I wouldn't want to go back.

# TL;DR

I didn't ask him out. Instead, I had a severe mental health crisis, stopped talking to all my friends, got sober, crawled my way back, and now looking back I'm surprisingly happy with how life turned out.

relationships,My (34F) partner (36M) treats me like alcohol is more important than I am,"TLDR: partner isn’t interested in cutting down on drinking, no matter how I ask, and I am hoping someone has a boundary they can recommend or any suggestions on how to address this with him. 

My (34F) partner (36F) “needs” several drinks a day after work to decompress. Several could mean 8 run and cokes, it could mean 8 rum and cokes + a bottle of whiskey + 1/2 a bottle of vodka. 

On the nights he drinks, he spends the whole night in the office drinking, playing computer games and watching videos. We don’t spend time together. We don’t eat dinner together. I feel alone in our home. 

He only works 3 days a week, so he’s also drinking and playing games/watching videos on during the day on Thursday and Friday as well. I work from home. I have to work in the lounge room, because I can’t concentrate when he’s drinking and gaming. But he comes out and distracts me because he’s been drinking and thinks it’s ok. 

On top of this, when he’s drinking, his snoring is out of control. So it’s also impacting my sleep, which means I don’t have a lot of energy. 

In early August, I asked him if he could leave the drinking to Friday and Saturday. I laid out my concerns. He said yes. 6 weeks later he was still drinking through the week. I asked him why and his response was that he felt pressured into it and like he didn’t have a choice. I told him, his refusal told me that his desire to drink was more important to him than me. He said he’d try again. No dice. No change.  He’d guilt me into “letting” him drink. 

3 weeks ago I said hey, maybe no drinking during the week is an unreasonable request, is 1-2 drinks instead of the current amount achievable? He said yes… and yet he still hasn’t done that. Last night I walked into the office to see he’d almost finished a 1.5L bottle of some random alcohol in one sitting. My response was ok cool, so not doing the 1-2 drinks this week, nodded and walked out. I made my own dinner and laid on the couch. He spent his night playing games and drinking. Then slept on the couch. 

I’m at a point where I’m done asking or trying. We live together and I love this man, but I don’t know what else to say or try to have him understand. I don’t want more nights last night. I even asked him, hey, now that the big project I’m working on is done, are you going to spend more time out in the rest of the house spending time with me? Yes. But last night he chose to not leave the office because “well there’s no negativity in here. You’re too negative”. Because I was upset that yet again alcohol is more important. 

Any ideas for boundaries? Any suggestions for me? Thanks :( ",25,0.76,69,alyssa_marie,2024-11-13 16:09:53,1gqp2sv,94,High
relationships,How can I (31f) tell my bf (26m) he needs to get a job?,"We've been together for a little over a year. When we started dating I had my career and he had a decent job. We moved in together pretty quickly, and he sold all his furniture from his last place (against my wishes). Everything was going well relationship wise.

In 2024 he was laid off in March from his job. He was on unemployment for a month and then got a similar carpentry job. Then in August he was laid off for a second time... this time I helped to rewrite his resume, find high paying jobs and even helped him find jobs in the government like I have.

He is being very very picky about jobs, and I recently found out he's getting $1900 per month for unemployment, which I think is a factor in him NOT getting a job.

He sleeps past 11am every day, doesn't help around the house, and he complains when I spend money on fun things for me / us.

The money doesn't bother me because my salary is more than enough for us, I just want him out of the house more than once a week...

TLDR: HOW can I tell him he needs to get a job without sounding too bossy ?

\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\*

  
He DOES pay for his half of the bills every month. This issue isn't about money. It's about lack of motivation, not doing things around the house, and the fact that unemployment $$$ runs out (in Canada anyways).",17,0.75,98,FrontJunior7052,2024-11-13 17:06:01,1gqqcdu,115,High
relationships,"My (F24) boyfriend (M23) excludes me from certain activities and says it's just a ""guy thing""- but I have done all of said ""guy things"" with him and other male friends all the time. ","Men in relationships, what does it actually mean when you say something is a ""guy thing""?

Let me add some context since I know what it usually means. My situation is confusing though, and this has been an issue for me since I was a child. I've never been able to understand why guys talked about doing ""guy stuff"" and it's left me isolated numerous times.

I am a woman (F24) in a relationship with my boyfriend (M23). He is my best friend and we also share a male friend who i introduced to my boyfriend knowing they'd hit it off. We play a lot of video games together. Recently we all lost basically all our friends so it's basically just the three of us, and maybe one or two male co workers my boyfriend is friends with. 

Anytime those male coworkers get involved with gaming, or going out somewhere, suddenly it's like there's a big elephant in the room and my boyfriend as nicely as possible tries to tell me that they're just gonna do a ""guy thing"". It makes me really sad and kind of feels like when you find out your friends all did something without you. 

Normally I would understand because women also have their ""girls time"" and men and women have different interests/hobbies/general ways of communicating (this is all a huge generalization so obviously there are outliers). However I struggle because I've already always had trouble making friends with other women, when I did have a lot of girl friends I hated ""girls nights"" where they'd all exclude their partners. I couldn't relate because my boyfriend is my best friend and it feels like something is missing when he's not around. It feels like the friend group has a hole in it.I've never needed to isolate myself to a specific gender. No it's not in a ""pick me"" way. It's just how I've been since childhood.

When I'm hanging out with my boyfriend and his friends, I have the same sense of humor as them, same language, same interests and hobbies; they never have to change how they act and talk around me because I act the same way. Hell I basically formed the friend group or begin with

That's where I don't understand why they still need to isolate me for ""guy time"". When they do it they act exactly the same as if I wasn't there. It makes me feel like the only thing that's keeping me from being allowed to be included is the lack of a penis between my legs, which ends up just feeling so unfair because I didn't choose my privates. 

Someone please help me understand. I do always respect my boyfriend's need to be alone, but this specific thing just doesn't click in my head. I've talked to him about it and he never seems to be able to explain it either, he just acts confused and shrugs it off. 

TL:DR My boyfriend randomly and unexpectedly says I won't be able to participate in certain things because it's a ""guy thing"".

relationships,Me   F 57 boyfriend M 57.  New dinner rules?,"So my BF and I often had dinner with his divorced male friend. 

Now that friend has a girlfriend. I’m perfectly polite to her, but secretly she is a bit fake and they are very “shmooopie” when together. Feeding each other etc. 

PDA

Now whenever my BF has dinner with this guy I’m not invited because “shmoopie” won’t be there.  

Well I was invited pre-schmoopie so this just hits me as rude.    My BF and this friend talk daily and see each other often. I’m cool with the occasional boys night as well, but this is consistent enough that I haven’t seen this guy in about 6 months.    I asked my BF if his friend doesn’t like me and he said that’s not the case. 

Note my BF and I don’t live together. I drive 45 minutes to see him and they always seem to choose days when I’m off work or have an early day which makes the 1.5 hour round trip worthwhile.  I always leave again because I have high school kids at home. 

TL/DNR: is it normal to have every dinner with a male friend be a boys night?   This only happened after my BF’s friend got a girlfriend and now I’m only included if she goes.   ",5,0.86,5,mito467,2024-11-13 20:24:20,1gqugyx,10,High
relationships,"Partner isn't great at figuring things out, unsure I want to marry him","TLDR: I'm (32M) in a six-year gay relationship with an amazing guy (34M) but unsure if I want to marry him because he's not the greatest at figuring things out when issues arise. Anyone in a similar situation and learned to accept it? Or found it a dealbreaker and left?

There are so many amazing characteristics about him and our relationship: he's funny, very kind and understanding, patient, our values and political views align so well, we have great shared hobbies/interests, he makes me feel so safe and much more. But ever since we moved in three years ago, I can tell he's not the greatest at figuring things out, planning, being proactive, taking initiative, etc likely because of his Type B personality.

For example, I had never moved in with a partner before but I was driving 95% of that process: finding properties, scheduling viewings, working with the landlord to finalize logistics, etc. And when we moved in, I was taking on a lot of the chores and mental load of running a house. I honestly felt alone in the process. He'll gladly do something if I tell him, but rarely was proactive. We've had talks about this and the division of labor is now more equitable. I give him props for listening to my feedback and taking the steps to change.

But that passive personality concerns me because he's not the best at figuring stuff out or being proactive in general. Recent example: I mostly plan our trips, which makes sense because I am more type A and my work isn't as crazy as his. But it's still draining to be the planner. So for our upcoming trip to Japan, I asked if he can figure out transportation and determine what needs to be pre-booked. The guy was struggling and I had to step in and help.

I know in the grand scheme of things, it's not a big issue. But I was triggered. I kept thinking if our relationship gets more serious and we get married or we buy a house, moving that forward logistically is going to fall on me. My mind goes back to when we first moved in and I felt alone in that process. I want to feel like my partner is by my side.

Anyone experience something similar? How did you go about it? I am trying to practice gratitude and recognize all the other stuff he's great at, but I can't seem to shake this off. I can't tell if this is my dealbreaker.",6,1.0,17,SimpleNClean1983,2024-11-13 19:04:28,1gqsvx9,23,High
relationships,I need some unbiased help,"I (32M) and my wife (32F) have been married since we were 22. Since we've been married we've almost never ever been apart. Really only for short work trips, and that's been rare and sporadic.

Just recently I had a friend nearly die in a scooter accident, where he was put into a medically induced coma, faced multiple setbacks and very nearly lost his life. This made me realize all of my old friends are drifting away from me as we've all moved across the country and very rarely see each other physically. 

With my friends recovery, me and a couple other friends wanted to do something special with him. We decided on a weekend (4 day) camping trip at a national park, to get the band back together after 4 years would be amazing. 

Problem is, my wife is treating me like I'm a criminal for wanting to leave for this weekend. She has said phrases like ""this isn't for your friend, this is to get away from me"" or ""this changes the way I think about you and your commitment to me"" she also said ""I wish I was your friend instead of your wife so you would treat me the way you treat your friends"". Now keep in mind, we've had very little problems before this and really are best friends. She's been sulking, not talking to me and quietly (not so quietly) crying for days. 

I'm at a loss here. I feel wildly guilty for making her feel this way, but also am appalled at the guilt tripping. Advice?? Am I being an asshole?

TL;DR
Friend almost died, so me and a couple others are going on a 4 day trip together to reconnect. Wife is trying every trick in the book to get me to cancel it. ",31,0.86,44,TheGraper58,2024-11-13 10:23:05,1gqgq9j,75,High
relationships,I don't know how to tell my partner I might lose attraction towards them.,"My Girlfriend(F26) and I (M25) have been together for a little over 4 years. She recently expressed wanting to get more tattoos/piercings around her face and body. I am not turned away by tattoos/piercings. My main concern is she expressed wanting a facial tattoo on her forehead as well as getting her entire neck/chest covered in tats, and multiple new piercings on their face, Including one on her forehead called a Third Eye Dermal. Honestly I love and care so much about her but Im afraid I wont find her attractive when she finally goes and gets those.

I wont be attracted to her after, facial and overall visible tats that can't be covered up with clothing is something I always thought was a bad choice, especially due to her working in a professional career, one that involves keeping a prim and proper appearance. She has even been sent home from work due to leaving in piercings or having the tattoos on her ankles visible due to it not being professional. Ive mentioned how these choices could affect her future in achieving her dream job but she still tells me it's something she will most likely do when she is finished saving up the money for it.

How should I tell her that this is a bad decision financially and professionally, as well as me not finding those decisions physically attractive. I want to support her I genuinely think she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen but I just cant get behind these choices that I feel would take away from her beauty.

Any advice on accepting that this is how it is going to be or how to convey properly that I am not attracted to these choices she wants to make and how it can cost her career.

TL;DR GF wants face tats and piercings and I am afraid of not being physically attracted to her after as well as her losing her career

Edit: I forgot to mention I have many tattoos and piercings due to cultural significance, and even then it has resulted in me being somewhat stuck in a blue collar career, how potential employers reacted to seeing me in person is definitely not a good feeling, even when my Gf would bring me around her office/coworkers I would get stared at or make the older people (boss and management) in her office uncomfortable.",6,0.63,27,Bulky-Wrongdoer-9891,2024-11-13 18:41:15,1gqsely,33,High
relationships,"he blocked me, but used me for sex?","i’m honestly so confused right now. i (21f) went out with a guy (22m) for about a month. looking back, the relationship moved extremely quickly and there were a ton of red flags. first, he said he enjoyed learning about people’s vulnerabilities so he can “manipulate them.” secondly, he lied and said he was 6 feet tall, when he was only a few inches taller than me (i’m 5’2 and he was around 3-4 inches taller than me, so that was a lie). third, he was extremely pushy for physical intimacy and pressured me into doing sexual act on him (not intercourse, but other stuff). the biggest one was that after we agreed to be exclusive, my found him on tinder 4 days later, claiming that he was drunk and gave his “friend” the phone who made the tinder account. this was the straw that broke the back in terms of me trusting him, and after thinking about it, i decided to end things with him. i sent this text a few hours ago:

hey, i’ve thought about it and after everything that’s happened, i think we should stop seeing each other. the trust is gone and it’s something i don’t think can be repaired. i know we talked about giving things another try, but i think it’s best for me to walk away. i need to focus on myself and i don’t think what we have is right for me anymore. 

he then texted me back saying “I 100% agree. Makes sense.” then, he blocks me on every social media (instagram, snapchat, even linkedin). i don’t get it. this dude never even liked me and we basically had one meaningless hookup, yet he blocks me? i would understand if he felt this way if he wanted to be with me, but i don’t think he even cared so this doesn’t make sense at all.

tl:dr: guy solely liked me for physical intimacy. i ended things with him, and suddenly blocks me on everything. ",3,0.71,4,cottoncandyskiesss,2024-11-13 21:17:07,1gqvhpd,7,High
relationships,boyfriend lied for almost 6 yr long relationship ,"so for context my (22f) boyfriend (23m) have been dating since highschool and are now starting our careers and live together with pets. 

throwaway account 

prior context: we’ve had problems like anyone else idk. we were 16/17 when we started dating and were at very bad points in our lives as we had just gotten out of abusive relationships (getting cheated on and manipulated etc by our first loves). he unfortunately then started abusing alcohol and thc after his relationship ended before we met. i didn’t realize the extent and eventually found out he was talking to people and of course i set a boundary and said wtf. he changed his behavior. stopped talking to people first as i found that out first. then months later i realized his insta had all the cornstars and we talked about that and he got rid of them (he followed around 1k and after he unfollowed them all he followed around 480). so that wasn’t great. never felt great. yeah i have felt like this has been a risk the whole time but now that life is getting serious it’s all starting to hit again. the risk of it all. 

so getting to the point i’m making this post:
i had a weird feeling about how he was acting or maybe feeling like it’s too good to be true and asked him to show me his phone for reassurance and he walked me through all of it enthusiastically. however it was obvious he skipped imessage (ios apple phone). so i asked him to show me it and in his deleted messages there was a deleted chat from a “bot” that he made a contact for named with a real name. as if he didn’t really think it was a bot because then why save it as a contact and try share personal info, name age location. there was even a good morning text. and that felt untrustworthy, we talked and i tried to move on. not even a month later i was looking for a meme he had shown me in his saved and ended up finding explicit definitely NSFW content. i exploded on him saying how he had lied and prided himself time and time again saying how he “wasn’t that type of guy. i outgrew that. i don’t need it. i don’t find other women attractive” but at the same time we’ve talked about how we can find other people attractive it’s just how u feel / what you do about it that’s questionable. and again if you’re open and transparent there shouldn’t be an issue… so again, feels like my last straw, and i found he had a twitter account since 2020 (we started dating 2018 and had addressed porn and he said he wouldn’t watch it well before then) and he used the account to exclusively follow cornstars. so again i feel lied to. betrayed. there had been so many conversations with our friends or about what content we see online like youtube and that and such and he obviously was lying about how he felt. he would always reassure me he wasn’t like “these other guys” or “how he was”. i even said now after all this we were young then and if how u felt changed u should just said it instead of hiding it and saying you felt embarrassed when i had openly expressed how much not hiding shit like that mattered to me after my ex and all that. 

am i crazy for feeling lied to when all his friends and family are saying i shouldn’t be so upset and his male friends make it seem like im overreacting by feeling so betrayed. the thing is, i wouldn’t have been so upset if he didn’t lie. and again he says he explains it and gives scope but still always gives me the energy im wrong for feeling so upset. i haven’t really told anyone but my brother and he is understanding my army heartache but i haven’t told anyone else. 

tldr; been dating almost six years and partner goes back on boundaries and spoken word, found out to be watching corn behind my back while reassuring me the whole time he “wasn’t like that” anymore.

relationships,My (F45) BF (M41)of 5 years refuses to leave despite numerous attempts to get him to go. ,"I have been in a relationship with my bf for 5 yrs. We have no children together and live in a house that my parents own. I pay the rent every month. As time has gone by, I have become increasingly unhappy in our relationship and I have on many occasions made this very clear to him. He ignores me when I ask him to leave, tells me he loves me and wants to work things out, he can make me happy and has nowhere else to go. Then he cries. I, in turn, tell myself that maybe this time things will improve and I can put up with our “roomates” relationship. We haven’t been intimate in over 2 years. He is always watching porn and pleasuring himself which has lead to a non existent sex life. We don’t kiss, hold hands, hug or have any physical contact. We simply exist, day after day, in my home. He is content with the way things are and doesn’t understand why I’m so unhappy. I honestly have given serious thought to moving out of my own house just to give myself some time to figure out how to get him out. I feel like I’m stuck in this vicious cycle of insanity where I don’t know what to do. He refuses to hear anything I say about breaking up or not being together.

Me - 40M, Wife -39F, relationship 20yrs, 2 kids under 7yrs old.

We communicated that I would pick up the toddler and she would pick up our elementary school aged kid.  She took my eldest retail shopping after pick up which was not communicated.

She arrived home at 6:15, and started the evening by complaining that I shouldn’t lock the front door since I was expecting them to come home. FYI, We always lock the front door.

Then complained that she didn’t see any texts that dinner was ready.

Then complained that we started without them.  We had just sat down and I was dealing with an impatient toddler.

I asked her if she had anything positive to say since she got home.

relationships,My boyfriend cheated on his ex ,"
Hi so we Are together for 3 Years Im F21 he is M25. Everything was perfect and we Are really happy together. We Are living together for the last 2 Years. We never talked alot about our past he only asked me is my body Count more then 10 i Said no because it really isn’t I asked him is it more then 10 he said about 10 but not more and he told me he was in relationship 4 years before he met me.


Right before we started dating he got a new phone.Two days ago he went to work and I was alone and bored a bit so i decided to see what he has in that, I know it’s stupid and I shouldn’t invade he’s privacy like that but I didn’t expect to find anything shocking. I went through he’s photo and yea I was shocked I found bunch of pictures with his ex ( didn’t really bother me ) and bunch of nsfw videos with other girls , on most of those videos he and the girls ( yea sometimes even multiple girl it was so disgusting I almost  puked ) they were all almost pass out drunk I asked him did he maybe had open relationship with his ex he said no and that he is disgusted by that . 


He also told me at start he’s body count is about 10 not more but I found atleast 15 different girls just in his videos so who knows what’s the actual number I don’t reallly care for his body count but thing that drives me crazy is that he cheated so many times and I’m so scared he will do it to me .Now everytime he leaves the house I’m sure he is cheating on me and it’s driving me crazy what should I do?

he quit drinking about 5 months ago & i’m so proud of him & have told him many times how proud i am of him. things have been better but i find myself not being able to stop thinking about how much he’s betrayed me. i start thinking about things he’s told me & put 2+2 together & realize another lie he’s told me. this thinking will then send me into a spiral & i’ll have anxiety for days on end because i start thinking to myself “what if he’s doing this again to me & i have no idea?”. 

when im in this “state”, i will be so cold & mean towards him. i will not really talk to him, be visibly annoyed when he starts talking, & just kinda push him away. in the moment, i feel like he deserves it because of how much he’s hurt me but once i finally come out of this “state”, i feel so incredibly guilty & tell myself he did not deserve any of that & it’s all an issue with myself that i need to deal with. i put myself in his shoes & realize if he was acting like that towards me for days on end without an explanation, i’d be sick to my stomach, crying everyday. i realize how wrong it is but it’s like im that moment, i can’t help it & i feel like he deserves nothing from me. 

how can i stop projecting all this negativity on him?

relationships,I don't know how to address my (25f) boyfriend's (30m) jealousy and insecurities in our relationship.,"Alright so me (25f) and my boyfriend (30m)  have been seeing eachother casually for about 2 years, now dating seriously for about 6 months. I've met his family, traveled to his home town, met all his friends, the whole sha-bang. I adore this man and think he's a genuinely good person. However, since we started dating seriously his jealousy is getting out of hand.

 A couple examples are...

- Whenever I go to leave after we spend a weekend or a day together he always 'jokes' about how I'm going to see my other boyfriend.

- We have a mutual acquaintance we've both worked with that I've brought up a couple times ""I saw so and so today, he said hi""  and he accuses me of having a thing for him.

- I left a hair tie on my arm while I slept and it was too tight and caused a bruise, he genuinely got mad and questioned me about ""who I'm letting grab me."" 

- I go skiing (one of my big passions) or hiking and again he jokes about going with my ""other boyfriend"" since he doesnt wanna go.

I've said before that I don't appreciate these comments and it's starting to make me feel like I'm trapped. Even though I know I haven't done anything wrong, I still feel guilty for wanting to hangout with my friends or do what I want, I feel like I can't even get injured without upsetting him and it's really driving a wedge between us. Im currently living with my parents, I don't party, I spend any alone time I have skiing, playing video games, or working out and I work 10 hr days. I don't have time or energy for nefarious activity. I want to have a serious talk about this in a non-accusatory way that makes him feel confident and secure about our relationship but I'm just at a loss on how to express that or if it's worth it? I adore this man but I'm worn thin.

relationships,You guys were right! He did it again… ,"So, I [F25]posted a few months ago about my relationship and how my boyfriend [M25] was essentially letting a woman interfere, make me feel insecure, and threaten our relationship, all to stroke his ego. I got advice that he was clearly disrespecting our relationship and me, and even enjoyed stringing along another woman because it made him feel better about himself, and that if it wasn’t the girl from a few months ago, it’ll be another one in the future. 

I didn’t take the advice. He moved in with me, we became “official”/exclusive. We’ve talked about next steps and our future. I thought we had worked it out and that maybe I was just insecure.

I’ve been in therapy for a year because of my low self esteem and I can now recognize when my insecurities are rooted in validity or if it’s some inner conflict needing to be worked out internally. BUT, he still somehow managed to make me feel like I was just being crazy and him flirting with girls was just me being controlling and insecure (because he continued to argue over his behavior around women, but I was gaslit into believing I was the issue).

Well, two nights ago, I caught him texting another girl. And to keep this short(ish), I asked to see the texts and he absolutely refused, said I was invading his privacy and acting crazy. It got to the point where I took his phone to look at the texts to see if it really was “nothing”, and the way he reacted was totally out of line, he was anxious, and obviously freaking out, and just seemed guilty of something. I was crying and gave him the ultimatum of either showing me the texts, because I’m begging for reassurance and he has the power to just squash this if it’s really nothing, or that our relationship would have to end and he would need to move out. He chose the latter. After he took his phone back (I never read the texts because he kept locking the screen and then took the phone back), he immediately deleted all the texts. I never saw them. But I can’t even imagine what they were talking about to where he’d choose hiding it over saving our relationship. He moves out on Sunday back home to his mom’s house in another state. There’s no taking this back. 

I am absolutely undeniably and totally devastated, heartbroken, hurt, and just fucking SAD. I dreamed of a future with him. I gave my everything to our relationship to make it work. I forgave him time and time again. He was my comfort, despite his blatant disrespect, all I’ve ever wanted is for him to love me just as much as I love him. I don’t know where to go from here. But I want to scream, I want to tell him how horribly he treated me, I want those girls to know that they are just as horrible (even though it is entirely his fault, these girls KNEW we were together and still tried to get in the way). I feel defeated and used and foolish. No one will ever satisfy him but why did I have to be in his path of destruction. Why did he do this me. Why? 

TL;DR 
Found him texting another girl, he refused to let me see the texts, and instead deleted the messages and agreed to end things and move out. No apologies, no reconciliation, no explanation. And I’m left wondering what was said in the texts and how he could’ve done this to me. ",1,1.0,0,Hellonobodyknows,2024-11-13 21:31:48,1gqvrl4,1,Medium
relationships,My (22f) boyfriend (21m) keeps flinching. How can I help him?,"So me and my bf have been dating for about 4 months now, and as the title says, he flinches all the time.

The last time it happened, we were sitting on the couch together and I went to reach for his face to kiss, but he jerked back pretty hard and then after a few seconds of him spacing out, he started apologizing over and over again.

Things like that happen pretty often and my only guess is that he has some kind of trauma. I don't think it's as simple as just him not wanting to be touched, because he has asked me for hugs before and we hold hands sometimes.

I don't know much about his childhood or past relationships, because he doesn't like talking about it but I know he see's a therapist and is on meds for depression I think.

I just feel really helpless, and I don't know how to help him. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

relationships,[22M] meeting a [22F] with no relationship experience meeting a girl with strict family,"TDLR: Was in the process of getting to know a 21F

We started of strong and have known eachother from work for 3 months now, found out due to her past relationships and experience her family has restricted her from talking to any guy. They would have Live360 on her and once I was introduced, which was extremely hard for me to encourage her to do as we nearly broke up due to the fact she wasn't able to do it. The family would constantly check our messages what sort of associations we have, on all platforms including discord mutual servers. For me I felt like I had nowhere to get to communicate to her or some sort of privacy, which hurts as this girl is my very first girl I've committed to.

We started of strong and would constantly laugh and love seeing eachother. Eversince introduction to the family, it seemed like she wasn't being herself anymore. She is an emotional person, once her emotions come into play it's tough for me and even scares me to even speak since she might take the things I say as if im attacking her, she would belittle me and say I'm just a boy since it's my first relationship and thst I always make assumptions and excuses, she was never able to meet in the middle during conflicts instead she would just hang up on me. It was always me that begs for forgiveness, saying sorry not only once and has to be in the exact way she wants it to be. I always make up big plans for us, such as going out and plans to introducing me to the family as we kept our relationship as a secret for the first 2 months. I put my effort in to get her the best bouquet of flowers despite the fact I got no experience in picking flowers, I would draw a portrait of her and send it to her but I never received anything back other than her mentioning that she's giving her time for me. I felt like the relationship is being restricted by the family heavily as I got to see them in person it felt very intimidating, since I was warn by her that she was only trying to protect me from them.

Things got so rough as time goes by, I tried my best to present myself on the table for the family. As an inexperienced person when it comes to relationship, I had my own flaws such as I would make my own assumptions, when during conflict she would always be the one hanging up the phone which leads me being emotional and uncontrollably having thoughts of wanting to end the relationship since for what I felt it was draining the constant amount of times I've said sorry which has now became a useless word. I too was selfish in my own ways as I was never able to understand or see in her POV, she stated that I always want to do things the way I wanted. She always ask for me to reflect and change myself into the person that she wants me to be and not to become selfish myself.

It has led to a point now where she doesn't want anything intimate with me anymore, she have blocked me on social media's which she has been keeping a secret from her family, she no longer feels comfortable around me anymore and says until the time she thinks she's comfortable of talking she will reach out to me. All because I was never able to change and I have been so selfish, and cannot control my own emotions, being impatient and make my own assumptions.. i hate myself now, and worried that I may be single forever.

I talked about jokes like this before  once and she cried and apologized cus I got a bit upset but she still makes the same jokes every now and then.

She told me teasing is her love language and I have a feeling she could be doing it out of insecurity cus whenever I joke (just to get back) about having other crushes or another gf she really gets bothered and shuts down?

relationships,How do I help my fiancé when she has trouble with a friend?,"
TL;DR fiancé is beefing with her bestie over bestie’s dating habits… how do I help/not catch strays?

Hello, posting this with the help of my 39M bride to be 29F who is having a lot of trouble supporting her childhood friend’s 29F recent dive into dating with a significant 30+ age gap. The dates have all been with men who are widowed and well to do. They have all been treating her well and she has been enjoying the attention.
When asked if she is attracted to them, she said that she is.

She is concerned that these men don’t share her friends values which has always been super important to her friend when it comes to relationships. The friend used to be all about finding love based on real connection, shared values, and compatibility. specific values include wanting to travel and be more nomadic. It feels like the friend is compromising her values and bride is conflicted of if I mention it. 

Overall Bride feels like Friend is compromising on friends values when it comes to love, which makes her concerned that Bride feels like her childhood friendship is falling apart over this.

What is the best way to support Bride as she struggles with her friendship?",1,1.0,0,EleanorPrinceLuna,2024-11-13 20:57:41,1gqv4av,1,Medium

My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years, but in the past couple months somethings changed. He rarely has compassion towards me, but shows care and interest when it comes to anyone else.
He always is quick to react to somethings, or when I show confusion. I feel like I have to watch what I'm saying a lot of the time so he doesn't get quick. I feel stupid around him recently and I'm getting really upset about it. He also really doesn't spend time anymore, 'll come over and he will do other things and tells me I can put on the tv. He also used to also always ask for nudes and be sexual over the phone too, but it's nothing recently. I feel like maybe he's getting it somewhere else or l'm too familiar and not as shockingly beautiful as others. He also gets really annoyed when I call it seems, like a why are you calling me? Type of vibe. 
I've tried bringing it up and nothing comes of it he always tells me he loves me and there's a future between us. But how do I bring this up? I really don't want to break up or even try and change him I just want him to know that I need reassurance and someone to be patient with me. It feels like every other person is held on a higher ground than me and I'm just trying to give him love and be myself but it doesn't seem right.

relationships,"My (20M) Friend (30F) i met in group therapy just confessed her feelings to me, and idk what to do...","so, i just recently started group therapy last month due to my rapidly declining mental health. i was kinda iffy at first to do group therapy due to my age and the other people in the group. the first person i was introduced to at therapy was her. we both got along well, talked a lot, and socialized every week about video games, rpg games, etc.

today, i started noticing that she may have started to develop feelings for me. i was saying jokes that i thought wasn't funny to me, but she laughed a good amount and felt very happy towards me. she slipped me a piece of paper and asked me if i could exchange my number to her, so i did since i felt comfortable with her as a friend. we then texted for a bit and talked after therapy.

well, just randomly, she called me and said that she had to confess something to me. next thing you know, she said that she had a crush on me. i felt really awkward about it especially due to the age gap. literally earlier in the day, i was talking to my 1on1 therapist about my ex wanting to get back together for a 3rd time, and he told me that it probs wasn't the best idea. now that my friend confessed and brought up the idea, i think the next best thing is to discuss it with my 1on1 and see what he thinks. he is a guy i really get along with and really feel trusted with.

i don't really mind the age gap, since im 20 and shes 30, but it still feels really, really off. i might give it a shot, but i wanna wait a tad bit first before i make a decision and see how i feel around her still.

relationships,How do I (38F) convince my coworker (55F) not to use holistic medicine for her cancer?,"Me (38F) and my coworker (55F) have worked at the same school for 9 years now. We hired in at roughly the same time (she was a month before me IIRC), and we have been work buddies since.

I have been fighting cancer for two years now. Mine is stage 4, it cannot be cured, the best we can do is hope for an eventual diagnosis of ""No Evidence of Disease"" (NED).

My co-worker has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. Since I have been fighting cancer for two years already, she came to me right away for advice. I told her the best thing to do at first is get the tumor removed, then meet with an oncologist to talk about an MRI and PET scan to make sure it hasn't spread. If it's localized and only stage 1, she might not even need treatment beyond surgery and the body scans to make sure she's in the clear. 

A couple weeks later, she started talking about holistic medicine with me. I made my stance on holistic medicine clear: it's fine for treating side-effects (like I even use peppermint tea to help with my nausea), but I would never, EVER use it instead of modern medicine. I would be dead by now without modern medicine. (median survival time without treatment for my type of cancer is about 6 months.)

She didn't seem too convinced though, and I'm worried about her. I explained what happened to Steve Jobs, how he had a very curable form of cancer but ended up dying because he used holistic medicine. She didn't sound convinced in the slightest, and I don't know what to do. I like my co-worker and I know she has teenage children, and I don't want her to get drawn in by holistic medicine and die because of it. What do I do?

relationships,Navigating different financial backgrounds,"My (24F) boyfriend (23M) and I have been dating for about 3 years now. Over the course of our relationship his family has often gone on lavish vacations that I could only dream of. My family doesn’t have vacation money and even if they did, I could only go if I knew I could pay for my ticket and lodging as well as food and other expenses. I work full time now which takes up most of the time I would spend going on vacations if I had the money. It’s really taking a toll on my mental health watching him and his family go on vacations that my family and I have always dreamt of. His privilege seeps into other aspects too, down to the shampoo he uses and the way he idolizes blue collar workers and wants to be seen as one. I don’t want to feel bitter or envious but it’s hard when I keep getting ditched for fabulous vacations while I stay behind to work holidays and live a pretty frugal lifestyle.

relationships,"My (21M) girlfriend but not girlfriend (21F) keeps taking mental health breaks, But I can't figure out if she really is or if she is trying to ""nicely"" end things. ","I (21M) have never really dated anyone even in high school. I have a really hard time finding people I get along with who match my personality and sense of humor. I finally met someone (21F) and we get along great like its kinda crazy. I asked her to come with me and small group of friends for Halloween but she couldn't cause of family which I completely understood, however it took her until that day to tell me she couldn't and said she forgot. I didn't mind as I'm a pretty forgetful person too so it would be insane to get annoyed about it in general but especially because I could 100% see myself doing the same thing.  
  
Around this time we had been talking again, things going great but then she vanished mid text and was gone for a few days when she finally responded she said she was having mental health issues and needed a break. I completely understood and told her I was just glad I didn't scare her off. I take mental health super seriously and if she needs those breaks I'd encourage her to take them. This leads to 2 weeks ago. I asked her on a date as she had (I think) hinted at wanting to go on one and I had wanted to ask her anyway as we get along really well. I asked her but then again she kinda just vanished.  
  
Over a week had passed and I knew she had been active online as we're friends on battle net and Discord. I took this as her ""nicely"" rejecting me but didn't say anything as I didn't want to rush her assuming she needed a break. Now 2 weeks has passed, we talked once 3 days ago when I messaged her though battle net because she went online and was playing a game. I asked if she was okay and she said she was and just needed another mental health break. I told her to take as long as she needed and told her to text me whenever she felt better but she never responded. 

Maybe I'm just really stupid and not understanding that she doesn't want to talk, I'm just super confused as we've played games together multiple times and in my opinion get along really well. However I also don't want to downplay her mental health or jump to conclusions. We've also only been talking for a month or two and... as you can probably guess haven't been on a date yet. Which confuses me even more, if I had done something wrong I'd take it as she's just nicely ending things however she even told me when we talked 2 days ago that it wasn't my fault. 

Of course that could also her just being nice but if it was then why hasn't she unfriended me/removed me? Maybe I'm over thinking it, any advice would be helpful. I do plan on talking to her about it if we do talk again. I mainly just want her to let me know she's alive and okay when she does take breaks but overall... I'm very confused.

  
TL;DR, ""Date"" keeps taking mental health breaks, but very confused as I'm not sure if she genuinely needs them or is trying to tell me to go away. We get along really well (I think), I asked her out on a date but then she vanished for 2 weeks+ on a mental health break, we talked 3 days ago very briefly where she said it wasn't my fault and that she needed a break. I fully support her if she truly needs them, and all I want is to make sure she's alive.

relationships,My boyfriend told me he wasn't sure about what love is,"My boyfriend (M20) and I (F17) are both freshmen in college. We became together 2 months ago after being friends for a few months. We're still pretty new, at least from how I view it. I came from long term (years), long distance relationships, while he came from short term (months) relationships. 

There were things that I haven't done before that I had done with him, because he was the first boyfriend I had that didn't live far from me. I stayed in long term relationships before because I think I have abandonment issues and I didn't want to leave until I am traumatized, so I also have traumas, and I believe he does too, but he lets go of things easier. 

We get into arguments, which I thought was normal for a couple who were still learning about each other, until the last argument that we had. 

We had an argument about the last argument we had where he said that I deserved someone else, and since then I had been overthinking about him giving up on our relationship, because I simply believed that if you loved someone you would be thinking about ways to help both of you stay in the relationship, and that statement made me feel like he was pushing me away. We made up then, but I still wanted reassurances. He did but I found it hard to believe him because it felt like he was just doing it because I wanted it. 

Then we argued again. He told me that we fight way too often for a relationship that's been going for 2 months, that sometimes when he tries to speak he doesn't know what to say, he feels unsafe, like ""walking on eggshells"". I got shocked and thought if he felt like that towards me, does he still enjoy my company? does he still want to stay? but all I replied was ""do you still love me?"" and he replied with ""i don't even know what love is, to be honest with you, or if we even agree on the same thing"". I couldn't believe what he was saying. He was afraid that as time goes on, our fights would get worse than it already is. 

Over the past 2 months, I've done almost everything i haven't done with my past relationships, and it really felt like this was the end and it happened too soon. It came to a point where I just accepted that maybe this is the end, and we are both giving up. So I just said that maybe we should break up, because if he wasn't sure of what love is with me, maybe he's right about it getting worse than it already is. He asked me if I really wanted that, I said no, because I was sure I loved him, but I don't want it to feel like it's one-sided. I love him and he's not sure. He asked me if it was still going to get better, I said I don't know but if you don't wanna try then we won't try anymore. 

Eventually we just agreed that we would try. He started telling me again that he loves me, that he's sure of me, and he's trying to reassure me every time I overthink about our relationship. 

I couldn't trust him, I trust him in a lot of ways, but it just feels like after he told me all of those, everything he's been doing feels like it's been done half-heartedly. Not that he does it like that after the argument, but I just feel that way after the argument. He tells me he loves me, he hugs me, he kisses me, I can't help but look at him with doubt. It feels like he wasn't feeling all of these with me because all I can remember is him telling me he wasn't sure what love is.

I still want to stay, I still love him, I believe he still wants to stay, I just want a way to get rid of the doubt. Or if it needs it, should we break up?

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 2 months but recently argued a lot, making me doubt our relationship. He admitted he’s unsure about what love is, which hurt me because I thought I loved him. We considered breaking up, but we agreed to try working things out. Despite his reassurances, I still feel insecure and doubt whether his actions are genuine. I want to stay with him but don’t know if we should break up or if we can rebuild trust.

I wind up saying no bc it just kills my mood to talk. I'll sometimes ask ""is there anything YOU want to say?"" in retaliation and he just responds with ""what do you want me to say?"".

I love her so much but I am hurting mentally and have lost touch with reality.



I’m 19 years old a freshmen in college at a big SEC school still don’t have a clear picture in my head of what I want to do in future, my dad is a successful man and I look up to him more than anyone, unfortunately growing up my mom got more and more mentally ill and is now not a part of my life anymore which I’ve gotten used too it doesn’t really affect me anymore, yet going through all of my junior and senior year in high school I met the most beautiful girl I’ve ever laid my eyes on when we were both at our lowest. From the moment we met we were inseparable. However once I got to college her being a year younger, still a senior in high school. It felt like she was giving up in way for example, I was nothing but faithful and still provided constant attention but she did  just not trust me to the point where it was draining, I was losing focus in school and touch to reality. I had no choice but to break up with her. After I broke up with her we were in this weird on and off phase for 2 weeks but it didn’t feel the same so I broke up with her for good but once I did that a day later she kissed and started hanging out with this really looked down upon kid in my hometown I was so angry and felt the whole thing was a waste. I ghosted/blocked her on everything for around a month and a half.

One night laying in my bed some of my friends call me a weak man for this but I unblocked her number, didn’t text her but my thought was if she ever needed anything ever my number would still be there, because I still loved her. To my surprise 2 days later I saw an unsent message from her she probably wasn’t expecting it to go through but I responded a day later saying “I saw you unsent a message, are you okay?” And one thing led to another and now I’m here 2 weeks deep of talking/hanging out with her again. We aren’t really public about it or anything but I don’t know how I feel about it, it’s like I love her and I don’t want it to end but the thought of her doing what she did so easily post breakup eats at me and makes me question everything. She is a huge part of my life. I know I am young. I know that’s a lot and it might seem cheesy but I am so in love with her I don’t know what to do. Maybe I just need to stay present and carry on with life and let time do its thing or am I just slowly hurting myself and there is something bigger for me out there. I think so much and this is always how I’ve been, I feel so lost. If any of you guys have advice I would appreciate it more than anything.",1,1.0,3,OkNebula1460,2024-11-13 18:14:11,1gqru0e,4,Medium
relationships,My dad (60M) thinks my husband (35M) is cheating on me,"TLDR: Dad thinks he's found evidence of my husband's cheating... 

Background: My parents keep an small empty apartment in a different city, where my aunt also lives. She has the keys to the apartment. My husband (35M) was visiting the city for business in August, and stayed at the apartment for 5 days. My aunt let her in and locked the doors after he left. My dad (60M) went to check on this apartment last week, and called me very seriously yesterday and told me that my husband had cheated on me. The evidence includes: 1) the two dining table chairs are now next to each other, as opposed to facing each other 2) he found lots of long hair, everywhere - my husband has a crew cut 3) the apartment smells oily, like someone has been frying stuff in there 4) there's some oily residue on one of the pot lids 5) my husband previously told my dad that he left a souvenir plate in the apartment from a company he was visiting for business, because he couldn't fit it in his luggage, and my dad implies that my husband may be cheating with someone at this company and received this plate as a gift.

My dad has concluded that my husband has cheated on me, and told me to be polite when breaking the news to my husband. I am not mad at all, actually I found it ridiculous...because I know my husband too well to find this plausible. I did ask him if he's aware of any of these things happening, and he said that 1) he set up his temporary work station on the dining table 2) he did not cook at all (and my parents know that - he has 0 ability to cook) 3) he met with the company's executive team and that's why he got a souvenir 4) if he had wanted to cheat with anyone, it would have made a lot more sense to get a hotel room, then to bring a girl back to his in-law's apartment, have her cook in my dad's kitchen (!!), etc. 

I asked my dad whether he has asked my aunt if she has used this apartment in the months leading up to my husband's visit, and the months after his visit. He said no he hasn't asked. I told my dad to check the surveillance camera, and he said will. My husband thinks it's laughable and wants to talk to my dad to clear it up. I'm looking for advice on how to proceed - should I have my husband talk to my dad now? I feel like he's made up my mind on my husband cheating, so it's quite an awkward situation...Thanks guys!

In the early days, we were both very well matched in that department: sex etc once or twice a week (which was almost as often as we saw each other at the start). But over the three years it's gone from weekly or more, to once or twice a month, to now around every two months. One BJ in the past maybe two years, and only once I've gone down on her. To be clear: I love both giving and receiving oral, but she tells me she has never enjoyed it so stops me whenever I start moving down to kiss her tummy.

Basically this just isn't enough for me. After conversations we've had in the past year, she seems totally sexually satisfied with what little we do, and she says she never masturbates because she doesn't have a reason to. If we ever pass an ann summers or victoria's secret, I gesture towards it and she ignores that and walks faster without talking to me for a minute. She is adamant that she is not asexual which leaves me a bit confused.

Bringing things like this up have almost always ended up with her not wanting to discuss our sex life any further, and it leaves her either sour or upset. So my question is, how do I get better at talking about this stuff with her? I am being respectful, non-accusatory, I use ""I feel"" and ""we""/""our"" statements, but we've never truly had a productive conversation about our sex life. I really need some outside opinion or advice about this.

Regarding our non-sex life, it's just about perfect. We're each other's best friends, live together, cuddle, have the same sense of humour, the list goes on and on, so this isn't an issue of losing our connection. Please help. Happy to give some further info. Thanks in advance.

relationships,Video games are ruining my brothers life,"Hello all,

I (27M) am growing concerned with my (22M) brother’s habits and lifestyle. 

He, like most people his age in the US, is still living at home. He has never had any real interpersonal relationships outside of family his entire life. 

He is up till 5 AM most mornings playing video games and clapping/wooting like a 10 year old.

Recently, The family banded together and got him to do something productive and help guide him towards being a positive member of society by helping him get a part time job and enrollment in school.

Now it’s the end of the first semester and he’s failed half of his classes and doesn’t seem that bothered by the whole thing.

My parents and us siblings are really worried about him and we don’t know what to do to help him at this point.

I know a lot of folks are just gonna say, it’s just games and let him live his life or whatever, but my parents cannot keep him forever and eventually it’s gonna fall on us siblings when everything goes south.

Please be considerate of the fact I am just trying to help and not trying to judge anyone.

TL;DR: Brother seems to be socially delayed or refusing to participate in regular society and I don’t know how to help.

Now he regrets it and wants to be back together but I can't forget this all,"So my (21f) bf (21m) of 2.5 years broke up with me a few days ago, out of nowhere. He was bottling up issues for 2 years and didn't bring them up, despite us constantly talking about open communication. Just last week we'd talked about a future together - getting married, traveling the world, having kids. We even recently booked flights to go to Europe. Then all of a sudden it kinda just came out of nowhere for me. He told me my sense of humour was hurting him and that we argued over little things. He brought this issue up to me earlier saying he felt like a bad bf and I told him I never once thought of him as that. I said I can change the way I joke and I'll be more mindful of it, but he insisted I don't change myself and that's it's cuz he's too sensitive but he'll change that. 

I toned it down afterwards, but there would still be times where a couple days after I said something and it'd get brought up, I'd have to clarify that what I was said was a joke (it'd be something over the top or said in a sarcastic way or while laughing and I thought he'd understand I'm joking). Besides this, and I do agree, I was annoyed a bunch at him throughout our relationship. Our fights would typically be him being so forgetful, not remembering things, not remembering his actions, making plans and then forgetting them, I was left planning all the dates so I started feeling he wasn't putting in the effort and when I told him that he just told me he felt like he wasn't good enough (I never once said that, and instead reassured him each time). I definitely am at fault here too because sometimes I'd just get so frustrated and annoyed that I'd yell sometimes (although he would too at times). 

He told me all this the day he wanted to break up and was unwilling to give us a second chance or for me to rectify my faults. But after we talked all his issues out, turns out more than half of it was miscommunication or misunderstandings and now he regrets his decision so much and wants me back. I do too but I'm just so hurt he'd break up with me and just throw away 2.5 years without even trying to have a talk first, especially after saying it's cuz we weren't doing as good anymore while simultaneously constantly telling me how much he wanted a life with me and booking our flights to Europe. I'm scared now he might do that again. That was the worst pain I've ever felt. He was my best friend in the city, after moving halfway across the country for university. We always shared everything with each other and hearing that he wanted to break up with me and was just lying all those times to me saying how much he wants a future with me and how much I make him happy, just makes me so sad. I wish he'd talked with me before coming out of nowhere with the break up. I feel so guilty because I was hurting him while not even knowing I hurt him yk?

I called up his sister later because I don't know many people in serious relationships or those that have gone through break ups and we are close enough to have talks like this and she told me a lot of it is him being super self critical due to the way their parents treated them and that they've always been sensitive. She also said she thinks he has ADHD so I looked into it and brought it up to my bf and turns out, he almost definitely has ADHD because we were reading together and if you have a certain number of the listed symptoms, then you pretty much have it and need to be medicated. Turns out he has 13/14 symptoms. And most of our fights and arguments were from his undiagnosed and untreated ADHD and that he just amplified whatever I said and read between lines and made up things which ended up hurting him more (I really wish I could've been more patient and helped him through all this):
-  him being so forgetful despite telling or teaching him things a million times
- me feeling like I'm at times taking care of a child
- trouble recalling events that happened
- failure to keep plans and remember important dates
- getting overwhelmed easily
- accidentally falling asleep while talking (this made me really sad and thus frustrated during long distance)
- forgetting to reply to things
- time management
- hiding and ignoring issues until they were unfixable and
- wanting to break up any time we had any fight and immediately regretting it
- not being able to handle his emotions 

I definitely agree that when all these things happened, I would get frustrated cuz like honestly at times I felt like I was having to take care of an adult and that he just wouldn't prioritize changing his bad habits. I regret lashing out at times but I just wish he'd told me earlier. I now see that all this time he actually just had ADHD and it could've all been better probably with medication and that I should've just been more patient with him. I regret so much not being more patient. He's the sweetest guy but sometimes I'd just snap when things kept on repeating and never improving. I feel bad now and I just wanna be here for him. I wish I could go back and change myself or make up for all this now. I also still can't get over how badly he treated me when trying to break up and how he went from 0 to 100 in now wanting me back and remembering all the good moments we've had. 

Has anyone experienced this? How do we both move past how we've been hurt by each other? 

**TL;DR**
My boyfriend of 2.5 years suddenly broke up with me, citing issues like my humor hurting him and our arguments over small things. We had just talked about a future together, and I was blindsided by the breakup. After we talked, we realized many of our problems stemmed from miscommunication and misunderstanding and possibly his undiagnosed ADHD, which explained a lot of his forgetfulness, emotional issues, and impulsiveness. He now regrets the breakup and wants me back, but I'm hurt by how he handled it. I feel guilty for not being more patient, but I’m unsure how to move forward after the pain of his sudden decision. How do we heal from this? BTW, we're going into long distance soon (I'm going traveling for 4 months and he's doing an internship in another country so we'd be in long distance for a year. I fear the damage done can't be fixed in the 6 weeks we have left before this year (or more) long distance and that it'll only get worse once we're apart. Do we keep going? The idea of breaking up with him before the trip is breaking my heart but is that the best idea here? ",2,0.75,2,xrshxa,2024-11-13 12:06:18,1gqj921,4,Medium
relationships,Navigating Rekindled Romance after a breakup,"

Me (30F) kind of rekindled relationship with ex (31M) a couple of months ago. We ended things last summer 2023 after nearly a year. He's German and sometimes his verbal communication can be harsh and also his delivery isn't exactly the best. But he has some other great qualities, plans everything to the T so I don't have to worry about it, pays for everything, let's me know about his whereabouts and he's very handsome man although balding a bit. I honestly didn't know how to handle him at that time since he had some deaths in his family and he shut me down. I went three times to meet him and gave him the support I could, but he was still processing those feelings and even the smallest thing I did bothered him and he got verbally combative, I got very upset and instead of communicating I started packing my things up(big mistake) and he broke things off. I cried a lot and he was very upset too for shutting me down, he sent my stuff through post too. We didn't talk for nearly a year. 

I go to Vienna( where he lives) often for work and for interviews and started seeing my stories and started asking me why I'm there, I kept things casual and one day he insisted to meet me even for a few minutes if I could manage only even a coffee. I agreed but I moved to Germany at that time already but we kept in touch, he sent me pictures of his family that things had cooled down abit. 

I had to go to Budapest meanwhile where I lived before for some paperwork and said I'll pass by vienna, he offered his place for me to freshen up from travel and everything, when we met after our breakup it was sweet, he kissed my forehead multiple times and gave me the keys to his apartment and told me in German that he's happy that I'm there. When I finished my sightseeing, he came home cooked for me and I ended up staying over. 

We still kept in touch, he let's me know about his whereabouts always, send me pictures of his friends even when he's with his friends on their stag do, when he's with his dad, cooking w his mom all those things. I ended up visiting vienna again cz I had an interview there, I stayed at his apartment but the old wounds kind of opened up, he has a very bad delivery as told before and it ended up hurting me, with him saying that sometimes I expect him to do everything for me and that i struggle with basic tasks to the point where he said in the future when we have kids it would be a challenge with how i operate things, when in reality I was adjusting to his space, after listening to him complain I physically shut down after that and didn't let him touch me, I also told him that he lacks empathy and he would be a good boss but I would not have him as my partner which hurt him I guess. He didn't apologize but I was crying at night and he thought I slept so he pulled me close, kissed me, wiped my tears and pulled the covers over for me. He really struggles with verbal communication and can only show through actions while I physically block when I get upset. 

The next day morning I was still very sad with all that happened, I made breakfast and he asked me if I would stay over and try to cheer me up with some king julian memes which I love but I didn't react, when all I wanted to was just to hold him. He came downstairs to drop me off and he told me that we don't have to go through the pain and end things and wished me for my work in Vienna. I said vienna is not for me and I wouldn't want to be here( I regret that too :( but everything was just too raw) and left. I had time process everything that happened. Although what he said hurt me, he has so many other good qualities. He's actually a great guy but just struggles with intimacy generally. He still hasnt deleted my number, has kept my things still unlike last time when he sent them back and actively views my social media. I do want to give this a chance but I feel like he's at wrong here and wanted him to apologize but I ended up clearing the interview too and I might have a next round in vienna soon. 

My question is should I reach out to clear out the air when I go to his city for the interview again? Is there a future here? 

I'm sorry for the super long post, just wanted to get it off my chest :)

relationships,"Text out of blue 1 month after nasty fight, me 43M, her 42F","Will try and get to the point...had 3 year relationship end 1 month ago. First 18 months were great, talked about marriage a lot, very serious. Then a series of monthly incidents where she would ""turn on me"" for no reason, sometimes ending the relationship. She would never fix these issues, was always me. The issues calmed down for a while, but came back with a bang two months ago, she lost her head over nothing and swore at me while my children were in the next room. Again, I had to reach out to her, but made it clear this behaviour could never repeat. I had identified that she apparently had PMDD, she looked into it and agreed. She was planning to get medical help. She came off her pill, and the hormonal shock of this apparently triggered another major episode, where she accused me of holding her hostage as I wanted to get lunch before driving us home, and threatened to ring the police. She then kicked off again and told me it was over again. This time I'd had enough and just replied saying while I'd valued the relationship I'd had enough of these regular unnecessary abusive episodes and I was moving on to protect myself.

I got a text earlier asking if she could talk to me, saying she was really struggling to make sense of everything, that it was fine if I'd moved on and she'd saw I was on dating apps.

I've got three options in mind, either reply in 3 days just asking what she is hoping to achieve getting in touch, and reminding her not to say any more abusive things, or to send the same message later tonight, or just never to reply at all.

Reading the tone of her message is sounds more like she's jealous that I've moved on than anything else to me. But still, we were together 3 years so I want to be a gentleman about this as far as is reasonable.

TL;DR ex got in touch after 1 month following nasty break up, should I reply quickly, slowly or not at all",1,1.0,9,Agile_Layer223,2024-11-13 14:16:38,1gqmds6,10,High
relationships,My (24M) gf (24f) is uncomfortable with me sexually ,"So me (24m) and my gf (24f) have been together for a year and a half now, and living together for a year. Our sex life was great in the beginning of course, and when I moved in it started to slow down. 2-3 times a month max, eventually down to once a month. Our relationship is great outside of this, very healthy, always communicating, working towards each others needs, etc. She has a hormonal IUD so she should would just say she has no sex drive and doesn’t have a desire for sex (completely valid and understandable). But I know that she would masturbate like once a week. She also would barely initiate when we were having sex, and then eventually wouldn’t initiate at all, I have a higher than normal sex drive so I would try to initiate once or twice a week(and this was me trying to limit my sex drive so I wasn’t pursuing her too much physically), and if she said no I would never get irritated or annoyed, I would always just say “okay babe, sorry for asking” and move on from it. The last couple times I did start to get a little frustrated (not intentionally, I just started to feel insecure from the rejection). But eventually after me trying to initiate she said she felt like a piece of meat and that all I wanted was sex and that she didn’t want to talk about sex or do anything physical for awhile. I said okay I completely understand. After about 2 weeks we were in bed and cuddling and I must’ve misread some physical signals because I tried to initiate and she said no and long story short, we had a discussion and she said she was uncomfortable with me sexually etc. That happened 8 months ago and we haven’t had any sexual intimacy since. I haven’t tried to initiate anything with her in those 8 months, purely just focused on our relationship. We didn’t kiss or cuddle for like 2 months after that, and then slowly she became comfortable with me physically for me to kiss her, cuddle her, touch her body, etc. but we still have had no sexual intimacy, no making out, no foreplay, no sex, I haven’t even seen her fully naked since 8-9 months ago. I have asked to makeout a couple times just to try and gain that comfortableness back, but was denied. (I never ever make her feel bad about denying me, I’m always completely understanding). Our relationship is great outside of this though, we get along very well, don’t argue/fight much, on the same page with a lot of things, communicate well, love each other, have fun together, I want to be with her very much. And she constantly tells me she wants to be with me and talks about future plans and our future together (so this makes me think that she does obviously want to be with me) 

A few weeks ago she brought up again how she was still uncomfortable with me sexually, and I’ve been feeling like absolute shit and extremely guilty that I made her uncomfortable in this way, I can’t stop thinking about it and I have a pit of guilt and it’s made me depressed the last few weeks. But anyway, my question is, what do I do? She sounds like she wants to be with me, so do I wait it out and see if she gets comfortable again? Do I ask her if she sees herself being able to be comfortable with me sexually? I’m just very torn and could use help. 

TL;DR. Pursued my girlfriend sexually too much (a couple times a week) and made her uncomfortable with sex, haven’t had any sexual intimacy in 8 months and she still says she’s uncomfortable but says and does thing that tells me she still wants to be with me, not sure what to do?

relationships,Feeling lost in my relationship ,"I'm 36f and my boyfriend is 42. I'm so confused lately as to what the hell is going on in our relationship and sometimes I feel like I'm the crazy one. 


We recently went through an unplanned pregnancy (that he didn't want) that ended in miscarriage. We also moved in together around that time, it's been about 3 months. During that (before the miscarriage) he also bought a house for us.

We've been together 2 years (met 6 years ago) and I'm very serious about wanting marriage and children. He says he wants these things but is on no timeline and since the miscarriage says ""I want a baby more than I want him""

He has a very addictive personality and living with him has been difficult. I'm a clean person and like to take care of myself and my home. He has struggled with alcohol, vapes nicotine and is high almost all the time. He's messy and dirty and I'm almost always cleaning up after him, especially his sticky 3am high binges. He feels like I'm a nag when I have to tell him that I can't live this way.

His latest addiction is video games. For weeks now he plays them all evening, we spend very little time together. Stays up until 3am and sleeps on the couch. He only sleeps a few hours every night. This past weekend he literally stayed up all night and didn't eat or shower. When I brought it up tonight he says that I'm being needy and that it's my problem and selfish of me because ""he can't meet my needs right now?"" On top of being ""needy"", I did just have a miscarriage a month ago and emotionally I feel so alone but I think he thinks I should be over it by now?

We are currently living in a condo that I own and in 3 months has not really cleaned anything and thinks it's a big deal that he started cleaning up after himself in the kitchen and emptying the dishwasher. I work 3 days a week/12 hr shifts and tonight he tells me that the days I'm working he walks my dog and cleans my dishes out of the sink (I'm out of the house for 15hrs those days). And seems to think he should get an award for that. Every weekend I change the sheets on our bed, clean the floors, clean the bathroom and the whole kitchen. I cleared out the entire second bedroom for him since he works remotely and i dont say a word about the condition it's in. He also hasn't contributed to any bills and I've let it slide because he was buying this house for us.

A lot of my concerns aren't even about my needs but about the status of his health. Not sleeping, poor diet, poor mental health, vapes, Marijuana and Adderall. He does maintain a very good job and makes good money though.

On top of everything lately he doesn't want to do ANYTHING. Watch a show together, take a walk together, go grocery shopping. Nevermind a date. And he claims he doesn't want to spend any money because of buying the house so I don't expect anything anytime soon. Traveling used to be everything to me and he has no interest and won't even compromise because it's important to me.

I'm wondering if I should just walk away. I'm starting to wonder what the positive things of the relationship are. We are supposed to move into the new house in the next couple weeks which is an hour and a half from home. 
I feel like I am never going to get what I need in this relationship.

There have been times when things are good, or he'll make changes for a little while (like for the 2 weeks we thought we were going to have a baby) but I'm just seeing the pattern now. He can be thoughtful, sweet and affectionate at times. He's very smart and funny. He's also making me feel crazy like maybe I'm asking for too much? Telling me that whenever he tries that I always ask for more.  Also that he thinks it's totally ok to basically go MIA in a relationship for 2 weeks (he's home but just either high or playing video games) and that I'm needy by needing attention in that time frame. Idk am I asking for too much?

TL;DR: My boyfriend is emotionally unavailable, addicted to anything and everything at different times, and dismissive of my needs. I want marriage and kids, but I’m wondering if I should leave.

relationships,Partner still upset over me responding to texts/snaps with other men during early/undefined stages of relationship ,"I (45f) have been with my boyfriend (31m) coming up on one year now. 

We met on a dating app and we agreed by 5 dates and things becoming physical that we weren’t seeing other people. 

By the 4-6 week mark, we were seeing each other 1-2x per week and really enjoying each others company. We hadn’t had any discussion about “what are we” besides being in basically exclusive and not seeing/matching with anyone else. 
Also, we had confounding factors due to the age difference. He had already told me that his parents would never be accepting of the age difference, that he could never call me his girlfriend, and that he couldn’t commit to the idea of not having kids. 

Because of things not being clearly defined beyond physical exclusivity and getting off the dating app, I didn’t know how to respond to anyone who I had matched with or talked to prior to us meeting. I didn’t want to shut people down, telling them that I’m in a relationship at the 6-week mark when my partner hadn’t defined it as such. 

I’ve been in situations before where it felt like a relationship because we were physically exclusive and not pursuing anyone else. But then it ended up not being anything more than just hooking up. I wanted us to be boyfriend-girlfriend but didn’t want to seem needy bringing it up at the 2-month mark. 

I even tried bringing it up to him “Hey do you ever have anyone reach out that you talked to prior to meeting me who doesn’t know you’re seeing someone?” This was me hoping he would take the lead and say “Yes and I’ve told them I’m not interested because I’ve met someone,” but he just said “No.” 

So even though I was no longer pursuing anyone, I would just reply vaguely to anyone who reached out to me (I’m really busy right now, etc or just not reply) and maintain Snap steaks because I stupidly cared about maintaining streaks. 

At the 2-month mark, he got into my phone while I was asleep and saw that I still had communication, snaps, etc with guys I had known prior to him. But none were initiated by me, just me responding vaguely. 

He ended things with me the next morning but then after a week, he agreed that we could stay together “but only for another 4-6 weeks because I do need to move forward with finding someone that I could have a marriage and potentially children with.” 

Things continued like that for several months. He would say about every 2 months that it’s almost time for us to part ways so he can be open to finding his wife. This has been an emotional roller coaster for me. 

Things finally stabilized by the 10-month mark when he asked me to be his girlfriend and told his parents about me and the age difference and even introduced them to me. He’s also subleased his apartment for 3 months and moved in with me. 

Unfortunately, we still have problems about once a month that stem from this initial hurdle about talking to other guys early on. 

I’ve done everything I can to give him reassurance that I’m all in with him (having my location on, allowing him to see something in my phone if he has questions), but it’s never enough. 

He’ll get an idea in his head that I’m lying about something and even after I’ve proved up and down that I’m not, he’ll just say “Well I can’t believe anything you say” or “See? This is what you do to me.”

We went out for happy hour with my coworkers last Friday, and he told me he got an idea in his head that I “have a thing” with one of my coworkers because I “had extra makeup on.” I tried to tell him how this was so far out in left field of an idea, but that was the wrong approach because I didn’t provide him enough understanding and reassurance. I’ve apologized for hurting him so many times, but it doesn’t seem to help him feel better. 

I love him completely, even though he has never said it back to me. 
But I don’t know how to get us past this initial hurdle. If I try and explain where I was coming from with the lack of definition of the relationship, he says “Oh don’t you dare try and defend your actions. Do you really want to go there?” But if his narrative is the only true narrative, he uses it to wield disrespect and accusations. He refuses to shift his perspective that I was unfaithful to him, and I am being sympathetic his hurt feelings. 

I want us to be able to move past this because I truly value what we have. How can we put this in the past and move forward together? 

TL;DR I didn’t break off casual contact with other men early enough in the early stage of our relationship and partner still uses it as an obstacle preventing us from getting closer almost a year later",0,0.4,13,Aggravating_Monitor3,2024-11-13 13:25:45,1gql6c0,13,High
relationships,Difficulties in relationships,"Me (24F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been together for 6 years (living together for 3 years) so I think i’m safe to safe we’ve gotten to know each other quite well. Generally 95% of the time we get along amazing, i’d say he’s like my best friend, however theres that 5% where we fight like crazy (not physical, just emotionally trying to hurt each other), todays been one of those days and i’m really struggling to calm down and it got me to think that there MUST be other people going through the same thing. 

So i came to ask here for advice: how do you deal with the difficulties in relationships (other than talking about it, because we do and we try), how can I work on myself or guide him to be a bit more mindful. Maybe you know some books or podcasts on going through these challenges (i’m not planning on breaking up).


A little side note: I become a little aggresive and protective of my safe space and inner peace and usually shut down and stop talking (I struggle to make valid points when angry and end up saying something stupid). 

He usually says something to ‘bite’ me personally, often blames me for causing the arguing and says that I act like a victim, however he makes strong valid points on the issue he is trying to raise.   

Please don’t mind asking more questions, to help understand the issue, but i’m sure it’s mostly all clear.

relationships,My close friend(20F) is kinda neglecting our friendship since she's with her new bf(32M),"We're a group of 3 girls. My friend who I'll call Lina(20F), our friend that I'll call Mary(23F) and me(21F). We used to be very close, but lately we barely see her and she's ignoring the messages in our group chat. I brought up when we could meet up again like a week ago now and she hasn't opened the messages Mary and I wrote about it yet. She has however sent me a meme or two on insta. In the past there were times where she was super burned out from work (she works morning shifts at a clinic), so I asked Mary whether she heard anything from her about being stressed etc. before texting in thr groupchat again cause I wanted to make sure I'm not putting on too much pressure. (Mary and her are a little closer as they know each other for longer) Mary told me Lina seems fine, just snaps her a lot from her bf's(32M) place. She's feeling kinda neglected too, though we both try to be understanding for her excitement in the honeymoon phase.

They've been together for like 3-4 months now and I haven't met him though. I try to keep an open mind despite the age gap, but it worried me a bit that Lina isn't coming out with us to partys anymore because she told me she doesn't feel it would be appropriate because her relationship is new and her bf doesn't know us, so the trust isn't there yet between them. I'm getting worried he's maybe isolating her? I don't want to assume such bad things about someone I don't know, but it's weird.

I noticed early he blocked my account on insta(I was just lurking because he's semi locally famous as a small rapper so his account is public. I wasn't following him or liking anything, just watched a story once). And when I celebrated my birthday recently Lina cancelled last minute. She said her cramps were super horrible that day and that was understandable of course, but she spent the day hanging out with her bf. I guess he was taking care of her? But Idk, it just feels weird we barely see her, she ignores our messages and her bf seems to be the only thing on her mind.

I don't wanna push her any further away, but I don't know what to do about this either. Any advice?

Tldr: My friend is ignoring our messages, cancelling hangouts and only spends time with her much older bf. We feel neglected, but I don't know how to adress the situation without pushing her further away. Any advice?",1,0.67,2,JustH3r3T0Share,2024-11-13 13:01:43,1gqkleg,3,Medium

I'm still crying while writing this post, I've always tried to treat everyone greatly but i never get anything in return.

My cousins calls and interact with each other quite frequently but i never get texts, calls even when i initiate first i never get a call back or text.
I've always tried to give my best in every relationship around me but i never get anything back in return. How do i deal with this what's the approach? I feel lonely and alone, i can't live like this all my life. Pls help!

relationships,I deleted a message and made myself look bad to the woman i talk with and i feel terrible.,"I usually write briefly but i will go on some details. I (30M) have been chatting with a woman (29)  for about 8 months.

We met online and we both live in countries of Europe. We talked with messages everyday, sometimes video call, photos, videos. 

In September we kind of  grew distant and we didn't talk for a week. I was waiting for her to write to me and when she didn't, i reinitiated conversation and we chatted. 

At some point i sent her some messages where I basically said i won't let her go because i love her and i want to work on making her happy. Then stated my intentions with her.

 We continued talking, i was more proactive, putting my words into action, asking for her number, doing videocalls, randomly texting her throughout the day caring messages, giving her updates about my day on my own, and calling her one time. 

She sent me an ambiguous message at one point, i got very sad, she noticed and afterwards said that it's not she doesn't like me or that she's not interested in me or that she doesn't need the care i give her but that I wasn't like that before and she still hasn't got used to it but she accepts my feelings and everything i want to tell her. It will take some time she said and we will have good times, bad times but we'll have good times. 

Two day later she didn't read my night message, and the next day she was taking long to reply while we had discussed it was our day off and we were planning to have a video chat at night. She answered she in bed but was taking long to reply, and left an innuendo she was masturbating..I thought she talks to other guys, i felt she was playing with me, and my heart sinking . I called her and asked how is she, she said she is fine, cooking. i didn't believe her. I said ok and closed the phone. I called her again, wanting to know what's going on, and i asked her if she sees another man...she said she told me again she is cooking, "" for 4 hours?!"" I replied, and she said no, cooking, cleaning, went to the store, I can't write to you anytime i do something. I answered of course,that's not what i said. Okay, fine. Write to me when you're free. 

On text she wrote What's wrong, why am i like this, i changed a lot, she doesn't understand what's wrong with me and explained she cannot and shouldn't be able to write to as soon as i text her.

I tried to write something for a while, how this behaviour made me feel and that i didn't mean to be press her but decided i shouldn't and just send her a goodnight hours later.

Next day she texted me and asked i was writing something for a long time but i only sent to her a goodnight??. I said I'm at work, can't use the phone, and will write to her. I happened to have to stay longer that day and texted her i will be a little late and that shes on my mind. ""Okay, I'm busy, too"". At home i sent to her ""Sorry, it's not that I don't have time for you and next time i will ask to take 5-10' to reply to you. I will try to be less clingy. I will just say, i hope you're warm."", as on a  previous day she was cold at work. 

Two smiling emojis, was her reply. I thought it's over. I felt scared she will not talk to me again, and i deleted my message, knowing i should have faith and give time. 

And hours later, she sends me a text saying you are deleting messages again, it's a little annoying. 

I felt cornered and didn't know what to say. That i was scared she will never talk to me again? Should i lie it was a mistake? Apologizing wouldn't do anything. I felt i had broke my previous word, and demonstrated i didn't believe her nor myself. I shot myself on the foot..

My father saw i was very sad. I decided to share with him what happened and he adviced me that when you start building something you have to back it up and the only way to try to  ""save"" it now is to tell her I deleted the message because i wanted to see if she was interested in me, to thank her for the emojis but i would wanted something more from her. A more essential communication. 

I did. She asked if i realized my behaviour is very strange, I replied it's not strange, it's the behaviour of someone whose flooded with emotions and whose feelings are dependent on her. I told her I didn't want to be needy or clingy and asked if she wanted to video call on our days off when we're rested and free. She responded that we can try, if I'm not having problems again. I just sent a yes and that  i won't delete messages again. She thanked me. 


I feel i cornered myself and feel horrible. No way to proceed. If i text her, i will be clingy, but if not, i will contradict my previously stated intention that i won't let her go"".. I fear also not contacting her will make me look bad and she will lose any feelings. 

I don't think she will contact me because that would make HER look bad too, since i displayed I don't trust her, by deleting. Should i wait until Sunday and ask about our video call? Message her a goodnight? It seems like the more time passes, it gets worse.

I didn't want to come across as clingy, i only wanted her to know i truly care. This is because in my previous relationship, i was perceived as busy and and distant.

What should I do...?

When i asked her to go to her country to meet she enthusiastically said yes... 

Tl;dr i talk with a woman online for months, i tried to express genuine care and i withdrew it by deleting a message. I feel horrible and i would like some advice on what i should do.",1,0.67,2,CarTricky1670,2024-11-13 12:54:52,1gqkf99,3,Medium
relationships,feeling left out when visiting boyfriends family,"My partner (25M) and I (24F) have been dating for about 7 years, and we have a very healthy relationship overall.

I don’t have a close relationship with my own family, and my partner doesn’t have much interest in being around them either. For my mental and emotional well-being, I feel it’s better to keep some distance from my family.

Because of this, we see my boyfriend’s family a lot. Whenever we visit his immediate or extended family, I notice that their attention is solely on him. They ask him all the questions and focus on catching up with him, to the point where it feels like I’m almost invisible in the room.

I understand that they’re naturally more interested in him since he’s their family, but it still feels tough when I’m not acknowledged or included in conversations. Right now, I’m on a family trip with them, and they haven’t asked me a single question about myself. I try not to take it personally, since they’re excited to see him, but I often find myself wondering, “Why am I even here?”

I love learning about his family and hearing about their lives, but since we see them so often, I end up zoning out because the conversations rarely include topics I can contribute to. It’s starting to make me feel drained and disconnected.

TL;DR Boyfriends family never seem to show much interest in me. My question is: Has anyone else felt the same? How can I handle these situations better? thinking i should spend less time going to/at these family gatherings..",8,1.0,9,Intelligent-Baker-53,2024-11-13 01:18:36,1gq7fhv,17,High
relationships,I [25 F] don’t know if I should tell my partner about my coworker. ,"
TL;DR: I’m a 25F, in a 2-year relationship with my 26F partner. I developed an attraction to a 25F coworker, and after getting too close, I set boundaries to keep it as just friends. Things feel tense now, and I’m not sure if I should tell my partner everything or just move on. Looking for advice on how to handle this situation


Hi everyone, I’m a 25 (F) who was recently diagnosed with OCD. My OCD tends to be more severe when it comes to my relationships. I’ve been with my partner, a 26(F) , for over two years now. I have fears and obsessions that my partner is cheating on me (which they wouldn’t), and I’ve also recently started to worry that I might be the one to cheat.

I recently met a new coworker 25(F) at my job. At first, everything was fine, but I started to find this coworker attractive. I began to obsess over whether this was normal and if I was a bad person for feeling attracted to someone other than my partner. After talking to my therapist about it, they reassured me that it’s normal to find people attractive, but this didn’t help me for long.

I started getting closer to my coworker, and we began to banter and fake ? flirt (joke around). I decided to put an end to this, telling my coworker that I only wanted to be friends, even if I found them attractive. I respect my partner and her partner, and I didn’t want to complicate things. Unfortunately, I had this conversation too late, as it was a month after all the flirting and banter had started. Even some of my close coworkers noticed that we were flirting/joking or acting too close to each other, and they said that my coworker had a crush on me. I would always deny that anything was going on, but it was clear that something was happening.

Now that I’ve had that conversation with my coworker, I’ve been distant and not as close to her as I used to be. Unfortunately, this has made work feel tense and stressful, even though my coworker and I are still on good terms. I told my girlfriend about this, but I told her that we had stopped talking because we were distracting each other from work. This is also true, but since then, my girlfriend has been making jokes and saying that as long as I’m not cheating on her with my coworker, it’s okay. This makes me feel tense and uncomfortable, and I know I didn’t cheat. However, I would absolutely fall apart and be distraught if my girlfriend was talking and acting with her coworkers like I was. 

I’m at a loss about how to handle this situation with my coworker. Should I tell my partner the whole situation or just move forward with everything? The only other complication is that I genuinely like and value my coworker as a person and friend, but I’m also attracted to them. This attraction makes me feel conflicted, and I’m worried that it means I shouldn’t be friends with them. When I set the boundary with them, we both acknowledged our mutual attraction but expressed our desire to remain friends. 

This whole situation is incredibly confusing, and I can’t help but wonder if I’m being unreasonable or if I’m doing actually doing something wrong or both. I’m seeking advice from anyone who can offer guidance. I’m also undergoing CBT therapy and taking Lexapro, but I still feel like I need more support in this situation.

relationships,I (20F) am struggling to communicate about intimacy with my partner (22M),"Don't wanna make this post long, so long story short me and my bf decided to try together again after he broke up with me through text after almost 2 years of the relationship and didn't exactly mean it. I have an unhealthy pattern of overthinking things and would rather get steamy even if I don't exactly feel like it and this combined with feeling pressured to be intimate makes it difficult. 

  We started getting back on track after a lot of talking and things got back to normal, let's say.   
We were having a cute moment together and I was showing him my childhood game while we were snuggled in bed and we said that we have to go to the toilet almost at the same time, so we decided to go together. He almost immediately made a situation more steamy between us and I went for it.

 After we exited the bathroom and got back to his room he made a joke about that game and I thought that he wanted to continue it, so I showed him more of it. I felt like this could end badly, but I didnt think about it too much. When I was leaving, I could tell something is off so I asked him about it. He said he's just tired. But after a few hours we started talking about It and how he is disappointed that I just got out of being intimate in a way and thought that the game was more important. I feel shitty about the whole situation and I don't know what to do now. We had issues about me feeling pressured to get intimate because of things he said in the past (that 1-2 times a week is not enough; which was later followed by saying that it is enough to him...and it really confuses me) and I'm really working on trying to overcome being scared to say that I don't want to have sex.  
I don't know how to communicate about this situation and he is showing me he's deeply disappointed in my behaviour, even if I promised I'll try to change. I'd be grateful about any feedback.  
TL;DR: I don't know how to handle a misunderstanding regarding getting more intimate and struggle to communicate about being intimate.",6,1.0,1,crispr9331,2024-11-13 03:32:53,1gq962f,7,High

Should I just send him a message? Or wait till we have plans? I want to tell him that either he puts in more effort to see me or I’m done.

relationships,Boyfriend (26m) was aggressive when on new meds when drunk. Has since changed medication and has stopped but i(21f) am still hurt and hung up on the past. How do i move on?,"My boyfriend if 9 months and I live together. He suffers from severe ptsd, depression, and anxiety. He had also had a suicide attempt early this year which he thankfully survived. I didn’t know him at the time of that occurring. After his attempt he was put on a pretty high dose of a lot of psych meds. And then maybe 4 months ago they increased his meds even more. I’m not talking about a little lexapro or something but very heavy duty medication. Stuff that knocks people out. And he takes all his meds 3x daily. He has also suffered from alcoholism in the past and occasionally will have mini relapses. Not full blown by any means but definitely using it to cope some days. He’s not an alcoholic by any means now but occasionally he will use it like that. When life or ptsd gets really really bad he’ll drink a few beers. But recently when they upped his meds again he would get blackout drunk a lot quicker and he doesn’t remember anything he says or does while blackout. 

He also works a lot and when he gets home he’s so tired from work and from the meds that a lot of the times he’ll come home. Have a few beers and fall asleep. Now I am in the wrong for doing this. I know. And it’s selfish of me to do this but when he sleeps so long I don’t get to see him during the day when he’s at work. Or if he’s at home he’s asleep. Like dead to the world asleep. So when I try to wake him up, shaking him a little or saying his name doesn’t wake him up at all. So I just annoy him until he wakes up. (I’ve since stopped doing this) but I would tickle him or shake him harder or shake the bed to try and get him to wake up. And usually it would annoy him and make him mad. And he has never hit me but he has grabbed my wrists pretty hard and held them or pinned them to the bed to get me to quit. Or when I try to take the blanket he yanks it really hard and we’ll do a tug of war with the blanket. He will yell at me to stop and sometimes says very hateful things. Like calling me annoying and telling em to leave him alone and GTFO and stuff. There have also been times when he gets drunk and we have an argument and he gets very angry. He’s never physically aggressive or trying to intimidate me. But he has been mean before. 2 particularly bad incidences were he got angry at me while he was drunk before a movie we were fighting because I told him he was wrong about something and he got mad that I always have to be right. He is right I can be pretty prideful. He raised his voice and tried to get out of the car and walk home (we didn’t live close). We ended up going home before the movie and talked it out and he took me back to the movies that same night and paid for everything to make up for it.
Another time we got in a fight over something. I don’t even remember what. And I was sitting on the balcony and he came out and argued with me and called me a b word. He never did that before then and hasn’t done it since. He always apologizes after and says that he Genuinly doesn’t remember doing these things. 
I beleive him because he Genuinly forgets things very easily. Like entire sections of some days he has no memory of. Likely caused by his medication. That’s what his dr said. 
Since then he has talked to his dr about the aggressive behavior. He has never had any problems like this before and they only started when he got on a high dosage of these new meds. And the dr said that the medication was likely the cause. He has gotten therapy and a new med change since.

Since he has changed to different medication the aggression has gotten much better. We haven’t had any physical stuff happen and he wakes up much easier. He only had one stint of aggression since the med change where he had been drinking and was blackout and he got mad at me over literally nothing. He spilled a drink and I made him clean it up and he was mad about it because I was being kinda aggressive telling him to clean it up. Not mean but very firm. And he tossed the towel at me after he cleaned it up. The next day he woke up and had 0 memory of anything. My guess is that it’s because some of the old meds are still in his system because he had recently been swapped to the new meds. 

We have said on and off that we aren’t gonna drink anymore but we always slip up. I’ll tell him it’s okay to have a beer or two here and there and then we drink occasionally still. He would ask to get a couple beers at the gas station and I would say yes. He would always ask before drinking but I always said yes. Which I shouldn’t have said if I wasn’t cool with it. 

Last night for some reason I broke and had a huge blowout fight with him over something small. We usually don’t fight and are best friends besides a few small things and this big issue. And I basically told him that if he cared he wouldn’t be asking to drink in the first place knowing how he gets and that a lot of his problems are caused by his poor decision making. This touches other aspects of his life that aren’t related. And basically told him I’m done with the drinking and that no more alcohol was alowed at all. And that he shouldn’t ask anymore. He Genuinly apologized and felt terrible and cried. He said that he cares about me so so much and he didn’t want alcohol to be what breaks us and that he is going to stop completely. I told him wine with dinner is fine occasionally and that this is the last chance I’m giving him to get his act together. 

I feel like I should clarify that he isn’t always like this when he’s drunk. A lot of times he’s fun and we’re having a good time and it’s all okay. But once he hits a certain limit and I do the wake up thing then he gets angry. Other than that he’s never aggressive with me and is an absolute treat. He’s very sweet and kind all the time besides in those specific instances. 

What do I do? How do I help him combat his mental illness without him going back to drinking. He says he’s fully willing to stop and I believe he will stop drinking whole heartily. How do I move on from the hateful things he’s done in those moments? Everything else is Genuinly fantastic and things have gotten much better as time has passed from him being on those meds. But I still think about those times and hurt. I don’t want to break up with him at all. I’m so in love with him. I don’t really even see this as something he’s doing to me but a side effect of his medication and me being a pain in the ass waking him up so aggressively. Any advice?

relationships,Struggling to trust new partner after houselessness. Do I move in with her?,"

After a very very rough couple of years I (25F) found myself in a better mental space, had a summer job, and found a person who I am deeply in love with (30F). We have been together only 4 months and do deeply love each other, which I am incredibly grateful for. My housing situation is difficult right now and she offered for me to move in with her. I am scared that she will abandon me when she realizes I used to be homeless, have fucked up many prior friendships/relationships before working on myself, etc and am not the zen and emotionally mature person she sees me as.

My current landlord/her ex friend (which is actually how we met) has severe anorexia as well as is paranoid. Has spread rumors about both of us that we are secretly vengeful and manipulative people.. I am trying to move ASAP but my finances do not allow me to get my own other place. I lost my job in September.

I didn’t want us to have to move in together to avoid a bad situation, I wanted us to because we wanted to and for No other reason. The strain of my landlord/her ex friend’s toxic behavior (e.g. talking about us while we are in the house, spreading false rumors, threatening my illegal eviction) is hurting our relationship, but I am scared that when she realizes the truth she will not want me and I will be homeless again. 

We just haven’t been together long enough for me to trust her, and after so many situations where people changed their minds and gave me less than a day to leave after trusting them to let me sleep on their couch, I feel like I can never trust any living situation I am in again and worry it’ll really damage our relationship..or it could be a beautiful beginning.

My survival trauma brain is messing with the part of my brain that craves healthy relationships. I don’t want to be homeless and I don’t want our relationship to become unhealthy. Both are extremely important to me.

Any advice is appreciated.

Yes, I have been in weekly trauma therapy for years

TLDR: I am stuck between an emotionally damaging, untrustworthy, and unpredictable landlord and a new relationship with trust but the with barriers that can only be surpassed with time . Feels dangerous to stay where I am and dangerous to bet my housing on a new relationship.. How do I figure out which situation is safer for me in the long run? I need to make a decision by Friday.

relationships,My [21M] Gf [23F] was forcibly kissed. Advice?,"My girlfriend went out of town for a week for work. She went down to the bar a few times where this old man was harassing her. One of the bartenders kept checking in on her to make sure she was okay. She ended up chatting with the bar tender and found out he was going to a concert. She decided to help him make the sign he was going to bring to the concert. In a public coffee shop

None of this worries me because I don’t want to police who my gf hangs out with.

My girlfriend is very outgoing and friendly l, that’s who she is. It’s her job to form connections fast. 

She told me about the old man at the bar and how the waiter checked in on her. She told me about helping him make the sign. She talked about me constantly to her co workers and this waiter. But he didn’t respect her boundaries.

Friday night she went back to her hotel intoxicated after drinking with some of her co workers when she crossed paths with the waiter. She said they talked for 10 minutes catching up at which point the guy said fuck it and kissed her. 

She said she froze, her hands at her side, and she blacked out of her body and didn’t pull away. When he finally pulled away she was crying afterwords at which he asked “Are you okay with the choices you’re making?” And she said no and left. he never asked to kiss her in the first place, he only asked if she was okay afterwards. She made it back to her room where she walked inside and immediately called me crying, saying she was sorry. At no point have I ever felt distant from my girlfriend, our communication is flawless and we come to each other with everything. I feel very loved by her. 

She is taking this whole situation extremely hard. She is having trouble sleeping, eating, and keeping a healthy mind. 

Fast forward I decided to try and talk to this guy to see why he would touch my drunk girlfriend without consent. At which point he replied with what I presume are fake text messages claiming that she went over to his house, they had dinner, watched a movie, and made out. Prior to this my GF had sent me a screen recording of her conversation with him. Her texts and his didn’t match up. 
I have 0 reason to believe some guy that wants my gf.

I feel like a horrible person because my girlfriend got assaulted and is doing horribly. On the other hand this guy got in my head and created doubt and trust issues. I often think “what if” she actually did those things. This whole situation is causing me so much distress. 

I trust my girlfriend as she is one of the kindest people I have met on this planet and has never given me a reason to distrust her. And with my heart and soul I believe she didn’t do this. But my intrusive thoughts are saying saying what if?

I just want to be present with my GF and heal, we have both been hurting in our own ways. Why am I thinking what if? Will that ever go away?

After the situation I had questioned her a little bit, she said she wasn’t close to this person emotionally, she wasn’t attracted to him, and she was not okay whatsoever with him kissing her. She thought he was gay for a majority of her stay there.

She has said that sometimes I have made her feel contaminated and that she wants to be separated from this event.and she is worried if she will ever regain my trust.

Any advice?

relationships,I’m thinking of these 2 guys and dk what to do ,"I(22F) know guy 1(25M) for about 2 years and I loved him, only guy I felt like I loved ever we had the best communication we rarely fought and when we did it would be super calm between us and he’s the type that would never lemme sleep if i’m sad. 

All was well until he started liking my friend he fell head over heels for her and they wouldn’t even know how to talk properly, i know for sure he fought for them to get together because she’s his type to a T.

when I couldn’t handle it anymore i stayed away and they got together but soon enough broke up.

Fast forward, he was going to get married to an other girl so he removed me and all the girls in general from his life and we didn’t talk For almost a year.

In the meantime, me and guy 2(33M) from work started dating and he’s super fun but we fight ALOOOOT like all the time and he makes me so angry but the way he loves me is crazy. He’s not toxic but it’s his first real relationship ever and he’s a decade older than me which makes me so confused how can someone not know how to deal with the simplest shit ( if we fight he’d just tell me we’ll talk later and not talk to me for like 2 days (this got way better now but still), he once screamed at me infront of people never did it again but still)

See, he has the sweetest soul but we had the shittiest beginning and he was so broke it would make me cry sometimes how i felt like i’m the man in the rs i drive he doesn’t i would pick him up to take us on date he’ll pay for later, ik he didn’t like the situation but i feel like even thou I understand i dont think i would ever forget these situations.

However, he asked for my hand from my dad and we’re still not engaged but the whole family knows about him (I’m not the type to tell my parents about guys i’m dating) but all in all we r much better now we fight less and enjoy alot more together and i feel the love growing more and more.

Just as everything starts going well guy number re-appears. He texted once, when i was 2/3 months in with guy 2  & apologized for what happened and i said it’s cool and ended it.

A few months later, litreally same week guy 2 asked for my hand my friend took me out and suprised me with him being there and we spoke about what we had missed in the past year and I mentioned guy 2 to him and it was cool and we went out an other time, me, him and my friend but we didn’t after that he tried to go out multiple times and sends me reels n shit all the time but out of respect for guy 2 I don’t see the guy but I think alot about guy 1 and how perfect he is.

Sidenote I didn’t tell guy 2 about the feelings for guy 1 but I did tell him bout the hangouts and he didn’t feel comfortable so I didn’t after.

What do u guys think of this whole thing i’m not thinking much of guy 1 but whenever i do i’m like he’s amazing & i wish he loved me the way I saw him live my friend and if he didn’t show that back then that definitely means he isn’t for me. Also nothing sexual ever happened with guy 1 which made it all the better cause he would come from so far away and do so much for me it’s crazy. 

TL;DR: I’m thinking of these 2 men and don’t know what to do :)

relationships,Boyfriend (26M) works away for work and it’s ruining my (28F) mental health. Are we currently incompatible?,"Hi everyone,

My (28F) boyfriend (26M) works abroad for 3 weeks at a time, and I hate it. We’ve been together for 2 and a half years, he’s been doing this for just over a year now, and I’m finding it hard to cope.

I feel like I’m being unreasonable, as lots of people have partners who work abroad or away from home for periods at a time, but I’m starting to think it’s okay for feeling like this lifestyle isn’t compatible with me.

I have bad anxiety and need a consistent routine and stability within my life, which is a me problem, and him working away doesn’t give me that. There’s no organisation, no set months or times, he’ll be informed he needs to work away and within 2 days, he’s packed up and flown out. 

I’m kind of reaching the point now where I’m questioning if this is the right life for me. I’d never ever ask him to find another job as it’s not my place to dictate or give ultimatums about what he should do with his life, I can only control my own actions and decisions and lately I feel that realistically, the only way to protect my heart and mental health is to remove myself from the situation.

I love him with all of my heart, we have an amazing relationship outside of this, which is why it hurts so much when he’s gone. I sat him down and had a conversation about how I’m feeling, and he states he doesn’t enjoy doing it, he doesn’t desire to travel for work, but that he doesn’t know what other jobs he would be able to get right now, and he can’t give me an end date to how long he will be in this job. He’s not actively looking either though.

Again, I would never ever ask him to leave his job or make him do something he didn’t want to do, but does it make me a terrible, horrible or weak person to admit our situation isn’t healthy for me and it makes us incompatible? Everywhere I read online tells me I’m not busy enough, or I’m codependent, or I’m being selfish, but the up and down, here and gone, lack of routine and lack of physical presence, the time zone changes, the not being able to plan anything incase he’s sent away, all of it is having a very negative impact on my mental health. I have friends, family, we FaceTime and text a lot, but it’s not making it any easier. 

I’d never be able to marry him or move in together while he did this job as the thought of sharing a family home with him and then not having him there for weeks at a time brings me so much anxiety and upset, so if he does choose to continue this job for years, our relationship couldn’t really progress.

Please if anybody has any experience, or advice, let me know. Please be kind, I’m not trying to be selfish and I’m always really supportive of him when he works away even if I don’t enjoy it. I just don’t know how much more I can take.

Thanks

TLDR; boyfriend works away and it’s having a negative impact on my mental health. does this mean we’re just incompatible?",2,1.0,11,KianaStarrr,2024-11-13 07:51:17,1gqdbuh,13,High
relationships,Advice on what to do next,"My girlfriend(f25) and I(M26), who have been together for 5 months, are facing a difficult period in our relationship. We encountered a similar issue before, and although we talked it through and resolved it, this time it feels more intense. I’m feeling uncertain about the best way forward and could really use some guidance.

About three weeks ago, after a lot of thought, my girlfriend decided to quit her job. I supported her in this tough decision, but on the day she actually resigned, I made a mistake. When she told me, I expected to hear more details about how the conversation went. She simply mentioned that she was doing well, which frustrated me since I wanted to hear more. I figured she’d open up later that evening and didn’t push it. I had a sports match to attend that night, and afterward, I checked my phone and realized I still hadn’t heard anything more from her. Frustrated and feeling left out, I chose not to respond to her brief message asking about my match, thinking I might say the wrong thing in the moment. The next morning, she reached out, sensing something was wrong, and I explained that I felt hurt not knowing more and feeling somewhat like an outsider in our relationship. We talked it over that night, and while she admitted she didn’t like me ignoring her, we both agreed that a lot of it came down to miscommunication and mismatched expectations.

However, in the past two weeks, she’s been more distant. Our regular three days of seeing each other dropped to two, and she didn’t show much interest in the date ideas I suggested. Recently, she spent five days away with her mother and two with a friend, and while I understood, I felt the distance even more. I managed to see her the Friday in between, but I had to work hard to make that happen, which left me feeling a bit uneasy. The tone of her messages kept getting shorter and less enthusiastic, which started to gnaw at me, and I found myself missing her more than usual.

Yesterday, she had another difficult conversation with her supervisor, which led her to formally quit her job. I wanted to be supportive, especially given the misunderstanding last time, so I told her I was on my way to see her. She declined, and though I offered twice more, she insisted, so I stayed home.

Today, at my request, we sat down to talk. She expressed doubts about our relationship, sharing that during her recent trip with her mother, she was torn between ending things and working through it together. She said she misses the spontaneity we once had, which feels replaced by routines and schedules, and she also feels frustrated that I haven’t done enough to find a new job. I agreed, recognizing she has a fair point. She also admitted that the “butterflies” she used to feel aren’t as strong now. Despite this, we both care about each other and made some agreements to help restore that spark. We’ve decided to step back a bit, letting go of our fixed days and shared schedule to allow more spontaneity and ease into things rather than feeling pressured.

I want to take these next steps thoughtfully and start by working on the things we agreed on. I’m ready to do my best and focus on what I can improve. I was thinking of planning a nice day together this Saturday to rekindle that connection and bring our date routine back to where it was, but I’m unsure if that’s the right approach or if it’s better to take things more slowly.

Any advice on how to navigate this would be greatly appreciated—I really want to make this work in a way that respects both of our needs.

  
TLDR: My girlfriend and I are facing issues after 5 months together. She recently quit her job, and a misunderstanding on my part created distance between us. Now, she’s unsure about our relationship, missing the spontaneity we had and frustrated by my slow job search. We agreed to step back from our routine to bring back spontaneity. I want to reconnect and am thinking of planning a date, but I’m unsure if that’s the best approach. Any advice?",1,1.0,0,Icy-Alternative8521,2024-11-13 11:35:30,1gqihxs,1,Medium
relationships,My boyfriend’s breath stinks. How do I talk to him about it?,"TL;DR: My boyfriend has bad breath, how do I talk to him about it?

My boyfriend and I (F27 M30) have been together for almost 3 years. A few months ago, I noticed that sometimes his breath stinks. It’s not overwhelming or extreme, but it’s noticeable enough that I notice it when we kiss, get close, etc. 

I know he hasn’t been to a dentist in at least a few years (due to insurance reasons). He uses an electric toothbrush (not sure how often he brushes)!and he does not floss regularly. I also know he has been struggling with his mental health as of late which could influence his hygiene habits. 

I want to bring it up to him because obviously I want it to get better, but I don’t want to hurt his feelings or make him upset. How should I talk to him? Thanks!

relationships,Worried about baggage in a new relationship ,"First time poster, thought about making a throwaway but will probably just delete. 

I 24M have been seeing this girl 25F for a month or two now. We’ve been talking for a bit longer than that and it picked up in early October and now we spend a ton of time together. Last night, we labeled it bf/gf but it feels like we’ve been working there for a bit. Everything is great and we really like each other. 

Last night, before we decided to “make it official” she told me a bunch of stuff about her past and essentially trauma vented to me after I let her know I was totally willing to listen. There was a lot, on top of stuff I’ve heard about previously. Overall, there’s a lot of stuff that is super intense but doesn’t bug me much. There were two things that did. 

The first was a history of a ton of hooking up. I don’t know the exact number (and really don’t want to) but it’s high and with frequency. For context, my “body count” is 5. Im less worried about the actual number and more worried about the fact that her choice in partners is extremely sketchy. Furthermore, the last partner she had “before” me was actually several weeks after we started talking. She said she cut that fwb off after she saw things getting more serious between us. In her words, she made it clear that I was her choice. I’m conflicted about the wording and general attitude because I had stopped pursuing other people (I.e, using dating apps) weeks before that. 

The second was a history of infidelity. In a previous relationship, she admitted to having hooked up outside the relationship out of anger over fights that were going on. The relationship was complicated and semi-open but the reasoning scared me, especially as someone with a history of volatile exs and subsequent trust issues. 

In short, I really like this girl and want to make it work but she has some baggage that is worrying to me with my mentality and past relationship history. Specifically, the high level of promiscuity and past level (or lack thereof) loyalty really worry me. She expressed a lot of regret over the loyalty issue and said she doesn’t want to carry it forward but my level of trust in her has decreased a bit. 

Should I discuss this further with her? I hesitate to tell her my concerns for risk of further traumatizing her and making her feel unwanted. I feel like being honest about my concerns might really hurt her. Is it really my baggage that is coming to the forefront here? 

TLDR; my girlfriend’s past level of high promiscuity and shaky loyalty really worry me even though she has expressed some level of regret. Should I reconsider my concerns?",1,1.0,7,ravenmiyagi7,2024-11-13 11:25:07,1gqi8rk,8,High

Now I want him to meet my family and come to my house but he already has in his mind that I live where my grandmas house is.

relationships,Help. I am exhausted.,"I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (25M) for almost 4 years. We used to have fights even from the beginning of the relationship, but they became more and more frequent over time. I am going to therapy and it helps sometimes, but lately I feel like I am the only one that feels that there is a problem with our relationship. Latest fight we had was because of a stupid situation, when I was talking to him and he wasn’t paying attention, he got “distracted “ by some lady parking her car and “almost hit a wall”, which in his opinion is a good reason to stop paying attention to what I was saying. He always refuses to apologise, saying it was a stupid thing and he doesn’t need to give me any explanation. It bothered me a lot, because he does it often. He just can’t admit that it was wrong of him to do it. I am exhausted. What can I do? Should I continue fighting for this relationship?

relationships,Girl I've been seeing suddenly called things off ,"I (31m) have been dating someone (21f) for a few weeks and everything has been jamming really well; similar personality and just overall very compatible. She seemed to have a great time on the dates and was vocally praising me after we slept together. But after our last meetup towards the end of the date she seemed a little cold and then today texted me that she wanted to call things off because she didnt feel an emotional connection. I'm not sure what went wrong but now I'm stuck between wanting to leave her be or to ""fight"" for the thing we had going, because I'm not sure if thats what she wants from me. 
 
Some things that I'm thinking about are that 1. After our first date she said she wished i would ask her more things, so the next time we saw each other i made a big effort to talk less and ask more. She seemed happy and enthusiastic. 2. The last time i saw her she talked about being stressed over money concerning her ability to travel during the holidays to see her family. I feel like i may not have comforted her enough over this, but we also havent known each other very long so i didnt know how much i should have done in the first place, but i probably could have at least hugged her or something. 

Tl;Dr do I texted back asking to meetup in person to try and salvage or do I just back off? She has been incredibly enthusiastic over text and in person so this is really catching me off guard. I have not necessarily been holding back but it hasn't felt like we've had a lot of opportunities to have ""serious"" conversations. We've been on 4 dates/hangouts.

relationships,My GF hates my parents,"My GF (31F) and I (24F) have been together for 3 years now, we started living together 2 years ago. We've had issues because of how she feels about my parents and my lack of limits towards them.

In 2022 she and I were living with both my parents since we were trying to save money to move out, however my parents started being disrespectful towards her. My mom's cousin was staying with all of us during that time and she was an awful guest, I had fights with my mom about that since I felt she had to leave and she defended her cousin by kicking my GF out as well. Since my GF hadn't caused any troubles, I decided to leave with her since I felt it was unfair.

During this process we had to find an apartment very quickly since we couldn't live with my parents anymore and my sister was pretty much on their side. Because of this they felt I was pushing them away and started being disrespectful towards my GF saying she was manipulating me and even kidnapped me. When we finally got an apartment, I stopped talking to them and visiting them, but then they outed my GF with her family because ""she was making me do this"", which caused her depression and anxiety, which she currently is still treating with anxiety meds.

For a year, they went to our apartment, called and texted me begging I talk to them again, saying my mom would die of sadness because I wasn't in her life anymore, that my dad would have another heart attack (he has had 2 because of smoking) and many other things. It was very difficult for me to set my limits and not talk to them, but I did for almost a year. Until I asked my GF if I could talk to them again, so they would know how I'm doing and would feel better. She agreed, but since then I started talking to them, visiting them, helping them with some favors they would ask and I even broke a promise I made to my GF to not help them financially, which I know I fucked up big time, all of this in the span of a few months.

My GF is willing to work through this, but because of all that has happened she hates them, wishes them the worst which I understand, they did a terrible thing and don't really deserve her forgiveness. I talked to her and asked her if she would be ok with me eventually helping them when they get older and sick and can't work like they do now, she said she doesn't know that today, but would have to be a life and death situation, she doesn't want me to provide for them, it would be a one time thing basically, and I don't know if I'm ok with that. I don't know if I'm ok with letting them get sick or lose their apartment (and this is me just thinking the worst, they're doing ok right now) because of me not helping them.

She is always saying that if it was the other way around, she would not talk to her parents at all, but I feel like that's not true. She is very close with her dad and I know it would be awfully difficult for her to do that. Her parents know were together, but don't talk about me at all, they just ignore the fact that I exist. Her dad has helped her financially and she uses that to justify it, but he is helping HER, not me. It's not the same situation, but it's still disrespectful towards me. My parents and I are not close at all, and it was still very difficult to stay away from them.

Am I in the wrong here? Should I be harsher with my parents and set more limits? Or maybe this relationship is not going to work?

i told her that the teacher did have a point, and that she wouldn't get yelled at if she just stopped talking during class. she obviously didn't take that very well and she told me that i should be defending her since i'm her friend.

she then proceeded to basically ignore me and, when we did see each other, she didn't say much and mostly talked to our other friends.

however, the worst part about this whole thing is, she then proceeded to write: ""if anyone tells me i talk to much again, im gonna stab them"" in her discord status. our whole friend group uses discord as our main form of communication, but none of them were there when the original discussion happened, so they didn't comment on it.

i feel like she reacted really immaturely, which i take issue with because this happens literally every time i don't defend her. i know that i was a bit harsh, but i feel like she shouldn't just expect me to automatically side with her in every conflict.

i don't want to stop being friends with her because shes my only best friend at this point, and our whole friend group would collapse if we stopped being friends.

relationships,I (27F) feel exhausted and don’t think I can work on my relationship with my bf (30M) anymore. How do I decide if our relationship can be improved or are we just incompatible? ,"TLDR: My boyfriend admitted to me that is he scared of sharing his thoughts/feelings/opinions with me because he feels I am too sensitive about a lot of things. I have tried to work on our relationship and myself constantly for 2 years to improve the quality of our relationship, and this feels like a 1000 steps back in that journey. I feel exhausted at this point, are we just incompatible or is this how relationships are in general?


My boyfriend and I have been dating for the past two years. We are deeply in love and want to get married. However we cannot overlook the fact that our childhood, upbringing, and values are quite different from each other. 

We started noticing these differences within the first few weeks of dating, and we had terrible fights. We would fight on almost every trip or major event. But we really didn’t want to breakup so we kept resolving every single fight by talking about our issues, understanding each other, apologising and changing ourselves to handle each other better.

To be honest, I have worked on myself far more than he has, and he admits this too. I spend a lot of time understanding how couples can resolve their issues, and actually implement them. I take the feedback he gives me, and think it over for weeks and months and actually make changes in myself once I understand the crux of the issue and how to fix it. 
For example, I used to think earlier that if anybody raises their voice in a fight, it automatically means they’re in the wrong and the person who is talking in a controlled voice is right, no matter the actual content or intent of what these people are saying. I realised through his feedback that this isn’t necessarily right
and I’ve changed myself to the point where I can handle people’s anger now.
Another example is that I used to stonewall him, I didn’t realise why I’d do it and how to stop, but I did a lot of self work and then completely stopped doing that. These kind of changes take me weeks or even months, but I’ve really worked hard to get better for him and tried to make things work.

Overtime we noticed are fights became less frequent and less severe. 
I felt we had made good progress, until 
last night he told me that he feels scared to share his feelings and thoughts with me because I am too sensitive and can’t handle contradictory opinions. Im heartbroken because this feels like a 1000 steps back from where I thought we were in our journey. I believe it has been my strength to have a growth mindset and actually accept feedback and work on it, but at this point I am maxed out. 

He feels I take way too long to admit and accept issues. I, on the other hand, feel I am not getting enough credit for working on myself and these issues. I don’t even see him making half the effort from his side to resolve anything. For example, what does he even mean that he is scared to share his feelings with me? If he feels I am too sensitive, why can’t he put the effort to understand why I am being “sensitive”, talk about it and maybe find a resolution?

I feel we are just incompatible at this point.
Are relationships this hard and is this the only way to work on them? I notice this pattern in men that they don’t reveal their actual issues until they get super comfortable in a relationship. How am I ever supposed to find someone who is actually compatible with me then?",1,1.0,2,Foreign_Spread9610,2024-11-13 08:22:25,1gqdz16,3,Medium
relationships,I (26M) don’t know how to move forward with my gf (24F) ,"Hi! I’m looking for some external perspective on my relationship. 

Here’s the background: I’ve been dating my gf for about 6 months now. Save for a couple of minor disagreements things have been quite please and positive. As I get to know her better though, some concerns are surfacing and I’m becoming unsure about the future of our relationship. 

Long story short, I’m learning that our political values are pretty far apart. We also seem to share different career aspirations. She is aiming for a more traditional “ladder climb” while I want to start my own business and become a digital nomad for a period of time. 

Also I’ve noticed the following emotional issues with her:

-she’s pretty consistently depressed and 
unmotivated in life 

-a couple times now she won’t communicate something upfront and the get upset days later about something I did 

-she mentioned early on she still talked with an ex occasionally. I asked her to discontinue that after we started dating. A couple months later she came back and said she wanted to keep talking to him. When I asked her about it a couple weeks ago tho she said they hadn’t talked in 4 months

-she has a pretty promiscuous past. (I know this one might be controversial. It’s not a huge deal to me but I find myself consistently bothered by it off and on)

To be fair, here are some the good aspects of the relationship:

-she’s very easy going most of the time 

-she’s independent and low maintenance 

-the sex is frequent and great 

-we generally have fun together when we hang out

-I get along great with her parents 

I guess I don’t have any specific questions just looking for some external thoughts on things. Maybe I’m being unreasonable expecting things to be perfect in a relationship. Maybe a perfect relationship is a fantasy.

relationships,20M 22F What do I do with avoidant gf?,"Where to even begin?  


I met my girlfriend online five months ago, at first I didn’t realize she liked me very much but she pursued it and eventually asked me to become serious with her to which I was surprised but happily accepted. It was rather good this time, we’d hang out often, play games and watch movies. I was overall very happy, flash forward around a couple month she went off to basic training. I kept in contact by sending letters, and also having her call me every Sunday. In this period I missed her dearly but her overwhelming love and just the amazing things she said in her letters really touched my heart. At this point I was certain that I really and truly loved her. I was supposed to go to her graduation but couldn’t unfortunately find the time or money to do so, as I’m currently overseas away from the US, I sadly told her and she was slightly disappointed and overall had a bad graduation, her family had failed to show up the first day and I felt really bad, in a way I felt I missed my first real chance to show out for her but regardless the days passed on. After basic she went to her job school and this is when everything turned for the worse, she often said she was “Busy” and had to study and I gave her the benefit of the doubt, at times I felt like the needy asshole because she’d dismiss my concerns and just say I was needy. Of course later on down the line I realized that she was lying, she was never really that busy, she often had more than enough time but at the time I trusted her and thought maybe I was over acting. Her communication was pretty irregular to a certain degree, I would put forward the idea of designated times we could talk as I felt we were losing our connection a bit, unfortunately this was only the calm before the storm. Once she started her actual classes, communication was pretty much impossible. I’d often send her messages only to be delivered and answered 4 days to a week later, I was really confused, oftentimes I’d call her and just wouldn’t get an answer straight to voicemail. I eventually broke and somewhat forced a confrontation as I seriously wanted answers, I called her a lot, messaged her on all platforms curious as to what's going on (yes I realize this more than likely wasn’t a good course of actions but I was distraught at the time), and on my final attempt she finally broke through. She told me she was scared and afraid, that she always does this and she warned me (she had never warned me that she’s the type to run away, only the type to be a little distant), questioning as to why I love her and that she was the bad person. Shocked, I didn't know really what to say other than that I’ve done so much for her, and willing to still do so much and that for us to just talk it out, of course she never really responded to that and instead ran away.  
Prior to this I had sent a package which arrived around a week or two later after this incident, she sparked back up again and we had a pretty fluid conversation, of course avoiding discussing what happened before but still saying she appreciated the contents and that it made her cry, when I told her that I loved her she reciprocated. Later on we’d discuss plans for Christmas (we had already planned before this all went to hell on seeing each other for Christmas), she said she was putting in time off but didn’t know what to do and I had asked her if she still wished to see me , to which she again promptly did not answer but more than likely read. She often sends pictures of herself without any context, I’ll make a comment and she won’t really say anything to it which hurts. I thought I really trusted this person and believed in them and this total 360 on everything I thought of, at first I thought it was rooted in some issue with me but after hearing her say what she said I felt bad. She obviously craves closeness but ultimately can’t, I’m not really sure what to do as we didn’t have an official “breakup” and as of posting this now, I haven’t heard from her in roughly a week in any form. I don’t want to give up some sense of hope but ultimately there is nothing I can do but wait.  


I humbly ask the people, what do I do? I still have some love in my heart for her, but what do I do? And even if I wished to break up how would I even go about that with someone who I can't even communicate with?

tl;dr GF did a 180, ghosted me and I wish for her to come back

relationships,"Should my ex (M, 31) and I (F, 30) be friends with benefits or is this a disaster waiting to happen?","My ex and I broke up about a month ago after two years of dating. We were close friends for a decade before that and our break up was mutual and amicable. We just weren’t making each other happy at that time and we’ve managed to remain close friends (going on nights out together with our circle of friends etc) and it’s not been awkward. 

Yesterday I went to pick up some stuff I’d left at his house and we sat and talked for hours, held hands, cried together at the fact it was actually over and we both admitted we miss the heck out of each other. We both admitted that a significant part of our relationship that we miss is the sex. It was incredible, we know each others bodies inside and out and we’re so comfortable with each other. 

It doesn’t help that I’ve recently come off my contraceptive injection and my hormones are running wild. I can’t get him off my mind. 

We agreed to talk about it on the weekend when I go to pick up the rest of my things but I know he’s just as keen for it as I am. There’s this magnetic pull between us that creates an insane air of sexual tension. Both is us kept leaning in and having to pull back when we realised we were about to kiss. The hugs and inside jokes came naturally to us and it was like how we were when we had just started dating. 

We would probably still be together if I’d decided I don’t want kids because that was a big factor in our separation. 

Can friends with benefits with an ex work? Or am I absolutely crazy for considering this? My best friend thinks I’ve lost my marbles and I get that most people won’t understand our dynamic and how we can be on such good terms considering we only broke up about a month ago. 

What do I do? My rational side is saying don’t do it but that’s a very small side as my hormones and libido have taken over the asylum and are having a party. 

Help!

relationships,The guy (24/M) I’m seeing (22/F) went through my phone last night.,"Okay yall I need advice on how to go about this. I am recently out of a short term relationship (22/F) and I started casually seeing this guy (24/M) for about a month and a half. He has been a bit intense from the beginning, very much swooning over me and wants to date quickly- we have a great connection and I love his friends and family etc and we spend a lot of time together but I’ve been very open and honest about where I stand rn and that I just need to go slow as I don’t want to jump into anything especially since I’m in a transitional period of my life. Long story short I had him and some friends over for drinks, at the end of the night everyone left and I had gone to the washroom and when I came back he was sitting really quiet and weird. I didn’t say anything about it because we all had been drinking and it was late, he quickly came forward and told me that he went through my phone when I was in the bathroom and read my messages with friends to see if I was still talking to my ex (even though we’ve talked about this before and I’m not) and he also went on my Snapchat to see who I was talking to. He found nothing as there was nothing to find but he apologized a lot and said he’s never gone through someone’s phone before and that he felt insecure because he likes me so much and was worried I was talking to other people but why not just ask me? Idk if I can push this off as okay there was a few drinks in the system and he was feeling some type of way. But isn’t this a terrible way to start a possible relationship. I do like that he came forward right away because he felt so bad but this is a huge invasion in privacy:( he may have also shed a tear or two lol. How do I go about this? Is it a red flag or is this something we could move on from or should I even move on from it?

Now I heard about this two weeks later from said friend. When I asked my bf about it he said that he was just ""joking around"" and his story was that it was about a ""red head fat bartender"" (his exact words) in another bar close by. And his excuse to the crude joke is that he was with his buddies and it's just ""dude humor"". I myself am fairly hurt by this .

relationships,"My boyfriend 25 M struggles with severe anxiety, especially when it comes to intimacy","Alex and I have been together for about five months now, and things are generally going well. We don’t have any major arguments, just the occasional disagreement, and I’m really happy with him.

However, his anxiety has started to surface in a big way during intimacy, and I'm not sure how to handle it.

He has been diagnosed and has a therapist, and I know logically that he can't control his anxious thoughts when they arise. I try to be understanding and supportive in our everyday lives, but lately, when we're intimate, it feels like I’m often just comforting him rather than enjoying the moment.

The actual physical part of intimacy is fine—I have no complaints. But if I’m not vocal enough, he starts calling himself a ‘stupid failure’ who can’t please me. Then, I have to hold him and reassure him that he’s not a failure, and that I’m not leaving.

If I’m too vocal, he thinks I’m ‘faking it to make him feel better,’ and once again, it becomes my job to comfort him.

Either way, we end up stopping for the night, and it’s been really tough.

I came out later in life, and Alex was my first in many ways. Being intimate with him is a big emotional vulnerability for me, and I don’t know how to handle it when this happens.

I want to be supportive, and I know this isn’t about me, but I’d love advice on how to approach this. We definitely need to talk about it, but I’m scared that if I do, it might send him into a spiral.

TL;DR:  My boyfriend struggles with anxiety about performing during intimacy. I have no complaints about sex, but he imagines that he’s failing, and it turns into me just comforting him. How can I address this?""",3,1.0,4,itsyourjoyfulgal,2024-11-13 01:29:21,1gq7ksi,7,High
relationships,help me navigate my (25F) casual relationship with (35M)!!,"i (25F) recently started a sexual relationship with 'Matt' (name changed for anonymity). Matt seemed drawn to my personality at first and how outgoing i was and i thought he was very charismatic as well! i recently got out of a long term relationship and in not looking for a relationship or exclusivity with this guy. 

We hooked up and had a fantastic time, as we are very sexually compatible and were chatting about meeting up again as well as what we liked/wanted to try. After hooking up though, I noticed he doesnt ask me anything about my day or myself and his compliments are always focused on my body. 

Im struggling to grapple with this because this puts alot of pressure and inward thinking about my body, as well as makes me think my only value to him is how hot i look. im struggling here because i dont know how to navigate a casual relationship; whats normal and expected versus not acceptable. 

i know every relationship is different in the levels of commitment, and i dont want him to message me all the time, but when he does id like him to acknowledge me as a person more, like how i treat him. For example, if we message about hanging out i ask him how his day is, or what hes been up to recently. i just think its polite personally, but what do you guys think?

am i just not built for a casual relationship, or is this a normal concern to have? i just dont want to be treated like a piece of meat just because we arent exclusive.

My husband(36m) and I(37f)have been been together for 16 years and married for 15. We have 3 children(17f,14f, 12f) together and everything was fine or so I thought. He said he has been in and out of love with me for 9 months but never talked about his feelings with me.
 

We started our own business almost 2 years ago and he no longer has his own identity away from the house. He says he doesn't know who he is anymore. He doesn't know what makes him happy. He says he loves me more than he loves himself but wants a separation because he is not in love anymore. 


I asked for MC and he said it wouldn't help so he doesn't want to try. He is not opposed to us working but wants to focus on himself away from me and the kids. He knows he need therapy but has made no effort to go. I sent him a list of therapists who take our insurance to try and help him. 


He is on TRT(pellets) and didn't get blood work before his 2nd set at 3 months. Now his testosterone is at 1200. I feel like everything changed a week later. He started getting short tempered, distant, less affection, road rage, lost interest in all hobbies...you get the point. 2 weeks after the ""change"" is when he told me he loves me but is not in love and wants a separation.

relationships,Should I (23F) end my 4.5 year relationship with him (27M)? ,"TL;DR: Bf always wants to be treated with love but seems to not appreciate it 

To begin with, both of us have tried ending the relationship but decide to work on it and stay together. His issue with me has always been that I put in no effort and don’t love him—the main things he brings up is that I never touch him as if I want him, I don’t kiss him (I love to kiss but i don’t like wet kisses, I don’t give him head and honestly its been months now since I last gave him head because thats all we can do since im a virgin; mainly physical stuff). He definitely is sex deprived but quite frankly, and I’ve openly communicated this, not only do i not think his hygiene allows me to want to do it anymore, nor does he build that intimate moment. He thinks it starts from the bed but for me i need to be in the right headspace and need to be treated nicely way before all that). I don’t think he’s ever tried to understand that. Seems like he has selective hearing and makes himself the victim in every argument. Anyways here is what has made me question whether its too late to fix this relationship:

  
I wanted to make him feel special. He always buys food so I thought I’d make him a nice dinner at my dorm. I told him to come at 7:30pm sharp because I didn’t want to occupy the shared space for too long and I didn’t want the food to get cold. I called him at 6pm and he said okay. Then 7:30 comes around and I call him to see where he’s at. He picks up and tells me he will be 20 minutes late because he was at gym and had to shower. I said that he didn’t have to shower. And his response was “right, not like you were gonna give me a blow job anyways”. It honestly ruined the whole event I had anticipated of being special and i told him to go home and hung up.

7:50pm comes around and I give another call. He picks up and lies to me saying he took a turn and went home. I was devastated. Couple minutes later he finally gave in and said he was joking but I didn’t find this funny. It was just making the situation more bitter. And I asked him why he has to ruin every moment by being like that When he knows I’m trying to do something nice for him. He then calls me saying he‘s here and I tell him to come to the entrance that is really close to my apartment. He says he’s waiting at the further one which is probably less than a minute walk. I tell him no, that I want him to just come to the closer one because I didn’t feel comfortable walking through the main lobby because there were a lot of people and i was wearing a tight shirt without a bra so I honestly didn’t feel comfortable. He says okay. He arrives and we silently go up the elevator. Then i open my dorm room and the room is dark but there’s a candle and flowers in front of him. But I dont think he saw it and walks past it. So i turn the light on still no expression. I tell him to sit down and that Ill bring the food. I place the candle and flowers where he’s sitting and he says no you dont need to do all that. But I tell him that I’m trying to make it special. And then he looks at me and asks me why I made him walk out in the rain, that if I cared about him i wouldn’t make my loved ones go through that. 

I didn’t know what to say and said I was going to bring the dinner. I place his dinner on the table and mine on the bed. He sits down and goes on his phone. I take it away and say it’s a phone-free zone, that why can’t we enjoy this moment together. He then asks to join me on the bed and eat and I say fine. He started to see that I was visibly upset because honestly his reaction to everything was so underwhelming, and he tried to comfort me and started showing appreciation (I feel like he only really comforts me when he sees me crying or upset). After eating we watched a movie and after that I just couldn’t sleep. I felt like my body didn’t want to fall asleep beside him, i wanted him to leave but obviously couldn’t say it. I then asked what time he was gonna leave in the morning and he said around 8am. I said I’ll put the alarm on and got his phone and asked for the passcode (he has never let me see his phone). He gave me the numbers but it didn’t;t work. He said that that was weird because its the right code and took the phone from my hand and chucked it on the floor and shoved my head against the bed so I couldn’t move (in a “playful” way) and told me to go to sleep (I was low key very fidgety that night because i coudn;t sleep). 

  
Next morning alarm goes off but we continue to sleep. Then it’s 10am and I tell him he needs to leave. Honestly I was still upset with how the night went that I didn’t want him to be there. He still doesn’t leave. Then it turns 11am and I tell him he needs to go. He says he would leave when I leave and I give a firm no. He finally starts to leave and then I realize maybe I was too much so I said sorry, that I was just upset from how I tried to make everything special but it didn’t turn out like that at all. And he said smth along the lines that it would have been special if i did smith that he liked, that all this extra stuff that I was doing wasn’t needed. 

  
At that point, I was baffled and hurt and said no more and let him leave. 

  
I know that he may have another perspective on it and that I’m not perfect. But I have been trying but I don’t think he even cares anymore even though he keeps reassuring me that he does love me. But then he never communicates his feelings. It’s when I start bringing up something that hurt me, he starts to dump stuff from the past.",2,0.75,7,BluesBB,2024-11-13 01:38:26,1gq7p73,9,High

relationships,I (29F) feel guilty for wanting to leave,"So I, 29f have been in a relationship for 10 years with my partner 33m. Think of it this way, I'm young and this is my first and only real relationship I would say. 

I really need advice before I sink into darkness. In summary I have no love, no feelings but distrust and resentment for my partner, but I feel like I can't leave.

To set the scene, I was so In love with him from the jump. I had no eyes for anyone else and I was so proud to have him. My family loved him and everything seemed great. I'm not a jealous person, so he would hang out with his people and I would do my thing. No biggie right? 🤣 wait for it....

So I got pregnant pretty young (don't feel sorry for me, ya girl still handled business😜) and it was all cool until I started feeling like he was messing with his 'bestfriend' let's call her Kitty, but I had no proof. There was shady situations, but I'm not the type to take things and run with it. So anyway, I let it slide. Mistake #1

We carry on and I see things toxic since the baby and I'm feeling...meh but I continue because I love him. He gonna spend all his time with the bros while the baby and I are elsewhere and then gaslights me into thinking I'm just making a deal out of nothing and he isn't gone as much as I say he is...but other people see it too. Mistake #2

So baby #2 comes round and it's much of the same and at this point we have been having physical altercations, all of which he says I caused but yall I was beat tf up. ( not while pregnant and ill add that it wasnt a regular thing either, far and few between and our son is completely unaware but it happened) but I stay because who am I to break up my family? I mean faults aside, he's genuinely not a monster. He's a good dad and a caring good man in ways, I know it sounds crazy but I don't know how to explain it. Think Jekel and Hyde? Mistake #3

I tried to prevent this baby. Birth control prescription was a little late, I was told I would be covered anyway, but I still went and took a plan B. Well, I guess God had plans but knew it was a terrible idea. We were not in a good place and I just was not ready. I thought of not having the baby but I knew I couldn't do it from the jump, I was kidding myself with the idea. Anyway I go through the pregnancy and everything was great, he's the supportive good dad, still goes out a lot though. I have the baby and the first thing he said to me was awfully offensive regarding the baby but I dismissed it as bad humour and we went on with our lives.

Fast forward to like 2 months after the baby, he decides to go out. My mother wanted to have the babies so I decide to go out too but with my girls. We come back in, he's drunk but not like totally wasted. We get to it doing what grown folk do. He gets up, he going to the store, long story short, I found out that he actually went to see some other girl (I suspected and he couldn't deny it) so I tell him to leave and never come back. The girl says that she was drunk and doesn't remember anything but said she thought we were over. He doesn't leave, and I can't leave so we continue living together and I put on a face for the kids but ignore him otherwise. We stop being intimate for the most part.

He then goes out of town for business and I tell him to go get tested and he does....( now sir if you're faithful, why you need a test?) Anyway, I let it go. Months later we get into a huge fight and he admits he bought a 'night walker' if u feel me.He says he did it because I wasn't giving him enough of what he needed. So I'm like boy I'm not stupid but he sticks to his story. In this time I find out he was also laying up with his friend. Yup. Yall remember kitty from the beginning? Not only that but he would talk to her complaining about me and all this mess. So I get an apartment and I leave with my kids. But this man begging for his life and his son missed him so much I felt like a horrible person. So yup....booboo the fool let him back in. Mistake #4...I mean are we still counting?

So fast forward to the present, I lost my job and had to move back in with him because the kids need him and we are living like we go together because he says he don't want no one but me ( apart from the fact that your name still be out there with all that mess even though I can't prove it) but the bottom line is, I can't want him. I know he's never been real with me and he probably still isn't. And even if he is, the ship done sailed. Like is that feeling ever supposed to go away? It's not like he makes me feel loved. I feel inadequate. He criticises everything I do. He's never wrong. I believe he might be a narcissist but then I sometimes think, maybe I am the problem  and I just can't see it. He's also done things like spread rumours about me, even telling people he wasn't sure if my kids were his before they were born which I was unaware of and shown friends inappropriate pictures/videos of us being intimate. Another thing I was unaware of and he still flat out denies.

My thing is, why am I still here? Why do I feel so guilty for the thought of leaving? Why do I feel like if I leave it will be the wrong thing? As I said, he's not a complete monster that would be a lie. I've sunken into depression and I'm barely hanging on... like there's so much more to it that I can't include but yea....I need to know I'm not crazy for wanting to leave but feeling like it will be the worst mistake ever. I dread being intimate with him and hate every moment of it....tell me I'm not crazy? What do I do?

TL;DR: I'm in a relationship with an unfaithful,  occasionally violent narcissist and I feel like I need to leave, but I don't know if it's the right thing to do. And if I do leave, how?",3,0.8,20,wokeandjoking77,2024-11-12 23:02:08,1gq5cra,23,High

My partner's ex, Ash, is still in the house they own together, has chronic health conditions and is financially dependent on my partner (Cedar) the problem is that since their breakup, Ash's condition seems to be going downhill. Their condition is very linked to their mental health, and right now she is extremely depressed to the point of being unable to feed herself, go to the shops, clean, manage the home, or get out of bed. She has a lot of health anxiety and her default condition is that she is down with something... a vomiting 'bug', the 'flu' a 'cold' and where these things are obviously distressing, Cedar is pretty convinced that it's anxiety and depression, not a constant rotating virus, that causes it.

We are now in a situation a year on, where Cedar is at his old house caring for her 3x a week. He cancels plans with me because Ash is unwell, or needs care. When I ask about the level of care he says 'it's not physical care, she just needs someone there. She is physically capable of cooking and cleaning. She just 'can't get out of bed'. 

I've always been supportive of him continuing to financially support her, it would be pretty poor form to just cut her off. However she does own half a large home through their marraige and if sold she would be more than well off. The issue is financial management, home management, she basically cant/ won't do anything herself. This is a big part of why the relationship dissolved, the increasing pressure and demands on Ash who was working 3 jobs to pay a mortgage that Ash is named on, but doesn't contribute to. 

She refuses to reach out to anyone else and claims that Cedar is the only one who truly understands how to care for her. With her mental health at the moment she is isolating herself. Cedar is constantly worried about her and it's making him sick with stress too now. The knock on effect is that I also feel really anxious all the time. There's always some problem. Cedar and I planned a rare trip away for a weekend for my birthday, and Ash threatened to end her life the day before if he went. We ended up going after he turned up to calm her down, but the trip with full of anxious messages and worry.

I want her to be ok but Ash just can't walk away and leave her. She threatens self harm, she stops eating, it's bordering on manipulation because consciously or not, she knows the worse she is, the more Cedar is there.

I'm just at my wits end. I want Ash to be ok. Mine and Cedars relationship is great and we want to get on with building a life together. But it's been a year of stress thats effected my  life too, my work, my friendships, my energy levels are effected too. I think I'm realising that I've been depressed for over 6 months now. Which is nothing compared to Ash, I work, I pay rent, I have all of life's other stresses too.

What's also happening is that when Cedar is there, Ash takes the opportunity to grill him and air grievances, Cedar is already exhausted for his 3 jobs to pay her house off that he doesn't live in. Sometimes he can't sleep until 2 in the morning because 'big conversations' are happening with an extremely distressed Ash and Cedar feels he needs to soothe her.

I'm at the point where I just cant see a way out. I'm scared of her hurting herself or worse. I'm worried for Cedar who I love deeply. I am struggling with thus prolonged stress, and being unable to move on. He needs to distance himself, I do believe he's making it worse by prolonging this breakup but she's just.... so fragile.

I know the answer is 'cut her off, sell the house,  break ties' but it's just not that easy 
With someone who is registered as disabled (chronic fatigue). They are married and right now don't want to go through full divorce procedings if they can avoid it. It's also not my decision to make. I could also walk away. Cedar keeps telling me that it's a transitional phase and we can start our lives soon but it's been a year now and I can't see an end. 

TL:DR-
Partner's ex is still massively emotionally, functionally and financially dependent on him and it's causing huge amounts of stress for everyone involved. There's complex factors at play including marriage and disability and I guess I just want perspective.",0,0.33,7,ThrowawhaleCowboy,2024-11-13 04:58:54,1gqac5o,7,High
relationships,How to forget someone without cutting ties with them?,"I (23M) have known this girl (23F) for more than 4 years now - we studied the same Bachelor's Degree, and now we're studying the same Master's Degree. I liked her the moment I met her, but at the beginning it was mostly superficial and sexual. This went on for a few weeks, and then the pandemic hit. Fast-forward a few months and we started chatting (but in a friendly way). I got to know her better and I started appreciating her for her personality and intelligence. I started developing feelings for her and decided to ask her on a date, when the lockdowns end. I thought there was a spark between us.

When the lockdowns ended, I was about to ask her out, when I discovered that she had recently entered into a relationship with another guy from our university. This hurt my feelings and I distanced myself from her, even though I knew their relationship wasn't going to last, based on my observations on their characters. In the end, this was a good thing, because I took my rose-colored glasses off and realized the big differences between me and her. Her relationship lasted no more than 14 months, during which I managed to stay friendly, but distanced.

The start of this semester though, we have started getting close again. We help each other out in university and she also always chooses to sit next to me. Unfortunately, it turns out my feelings for her haven't evaporated and I'm starting getting attached to her again.

I don't like this. She's beautiful, smart and kind and I like her energy and radiance. There are very few girls like her. We share a similar taste for music, but we still have significant emotional and character differences. It is always me, who initiates the conversion (and that's OK), but if we stop talking when classes start, she never resumes the conversation during the break.

\- I can't ask her out on a date, because I don't want to waste time in a relationship that I know ultimately isn't going to work. Moreover, I don't have a job. Now is the time to work on my career. I don't even think she has any feelings for me.

\- I can't cut ties with her completely, because we are somewhat dependent on each other's help, as we barely know other students and since we can't attend all lectures at all times, we often exchange information and sometimes study together. I don't want to cut ties abruptly, as this may disturb her. I don't think I can do this gradually either, as I don't have the necessary willpower.

\- I tried partially reducing my interactions with her, but it doesn't work - I always reattach after some time.



The current situation is unpleasant for me. I am afraid my attraction is turning into love. I now care more about her soul than her body. I often find myself distracted and thinking about her, instead of doing what I am supposed to do at that particular moment. As a person, who has always been in full control of my life, this helplessness is driving me crazy. I am also afraid of determinate action, because I am recovering from an addiction and I fear that an emotional breakdown will bring me right back into the fold.



Is there a third, middle way, to handle this, other than asking her out or cutting ties with her completely?



TL;DR: I (23M) like this girl(23F) but I know deep-down we are incompatible. I am torn apart between asking her out and breaking ties with her completely. I don't like being distracted by thoughts about her. Is there a way to eradicate my feelings for her, so that I can go on with my life, without breaking ties with her completely?

relationships,I’ve been with my partner for almost a year and he’s not able to tell me he loves me yet. ,"Im 33F and partner is 40M previously married, where as I haven’t been. Neither of us have children, he and his ex had a clean break. Hes an extremely kind, genuine and respectful person and we have a great relationship. His actions do make me feel extremely cared for. I have no reservations other than not hearing those 3 words. 

Actions are of course incredibly important and I absolutely do not take that for granted. I have asked him where he’s at and he’s quite simply ‘not there yet’. In his own words, he’s naturally a slow burner and I imagine there’s still a deeper level of pain from his previous relationship.  Although we’ve been together for approaching a year. We previously dated for a few months a few years ago. Not long after his divorce. He wasn’t sure about his desire for children. Whereas I’ve always been sure. So I made a decision to end it. 

He has assured me that he is now open to it, which is when we resumed our relationship. 

I’m really struggling with not hearing the words as for me I don’t want to interpret his actions as meaning more. When it could just be that he treats me well because he’s a good person. I told him I loved him a few months in. He didn’t say it back, but gave me a lovely speech of how much I meant to him. So although I was dissapointed I was able to give him time following this. 

However almost a year in my patience is now running extremely thin. 

I almost ended the relationship recently  because I feel like I don’t have clarity about how he really feels and it’s eroding my excitement and passion for this relationship.  I’m finding that my own love for him is rescinding quickly. 

Should I leave? Would I be making a huge mistake? Or am I saving myself?

relationships,Navigating My Passion and My Partner's Concerns,"TL;DR - 

* In a 5-year relationship with a generally happy dynamic.
* Recently transitioned from a fintech job to full-time content creation, which my dream.
* Girlfriend is unsupportive, often doubts success, and compares content to top creators, making it emotionally challenging.
* Considering ending the relationship due to constant discouragement but feels conflicted because I love her so effin much.

I’ve (26M) been with my girlfriend (26F) for 5 years, and we’ve had a pretty happy relationship. Recently, I transitioned from working at a fintech startup to creating content online, and I’ve realized this is what I truly want to pursue full-time. I have about six months of savings set aside, enough to cover expenses, including those for my girlfriend.

However, she’s been very critical of my decision. Despite trying to explain that this is my passion, something I genuinely want to commit to, she just doesn’t seem supportive. She often hints that my content creation efforts will fail and that I’ll end up broke, which really brings me down. She also points out how my videos don’t measure up to “top creators,” which I understand—I know I have room to grow, and I’m working on it.

Lately, I’ve been considering ending the relationship because I don’t want to be discouraged or made to feel inadequate for following my dream. Still, I feel torn because I truly love her deeply.

I’m really struggling here. What should I do? I’d appreciate any advice.",1,1.0,0,FlimsyAppeal2361,2024-11-13 04:34:34,1gqa062,1,Medium
relationships,How Do I (Early 20s F) Stop Feeling Entitled to a Relationship?,"I'm in my early 20s and a lesbian. I have never been in a relationship before, in large part because I was closeted and mentally unstable for most of my life.

My whole life I believed that love was conditional—that I had to be worthy of it—I had to be social, *useful* in some way shape or form, and always cheerful and never angry to be worthy of it. I've put in enough of the work to realize that isn't the case, but now I'm upset because I look around me and everyone seems to have someone. Everyone except me. I don't have anyone even after years of self-work. And I look at other people and I see that they're far from being healed, far from being ""worthy"" of love and attention, but they *do* have someone that loves them regardless. Is my suffering less than theirs? Is my effort less than theirs? Why can't I even receive a simple ""good job, you've worked hard"" from anyone? Everyone else gets a shoulder to cry on, everyone else gets an ""I understand, it must have been hard for you"". Everyone else has someone on their side that accepts them just the way they are. Why not me?

Whatever the problem with me may be, I don't have the right to judge whether someone is worthy of being loved or not especially when I've already acknowledged you don't have to become someone brilliant before you can be loved. I don't even know the people I'm judging.

How do I stop feeling entitled to a relationship?

TLDR: I'm jealous of other people being in love and being loved because I don't think they deserve that. I'm pretty sure I'm feeling entitled to a relationship after suffering for years on my own and finally being ""qualified"" for one.

relationships,I (35M) developed feelings for friend (28F) who is emotionally unavailable due to trauma,"Hello,

I (35M) have been in a long term relationship for 13 years that regrettably (or the way I see it now, for the better of both of us) ended last year. Since then I have worked hard to sort myself out and become happy with myself and my life. Do note I am on the autism spectrum - not obviously impaired but it comes with certain challenges in communication and social contexts.

4 months ago I made a new friend (28F) whos part of my friend group with whom I quickly developed what I felt was a deep connection. We got to see each other regularly (1-2 times per week) and at times spent hours on walks talking about our lives and most inner thoughts and feelings. I have a decent social circle but no one else in my life with whom it is so easy to feel safe sharing these things and who is understanding and sensible enough to communicate with me in a certain way that makes everything fall into place so easily. There seem to be no barriers like with many other people that I interact with and something is always coming back. She helped me through a rough patch through speaking about it alone. I appreciate her a lot.

I love her assertiveness. That she so easily puts down a strong word on her thoughts and opinions without disguising them like most people do. She is direct and honest, very strong and inspiring but can also show vulnerability and that way open the space for me to be. We share values in family and sustainability and have compatible aspirations. I do like her shiny, curvy hair, straight teeth that make a big smile that I won't forget in my life and her smell that makes every space she enters feel like spring time. I wish she would see herself the way I see her.

I developed feelings for her since I acknowledge these feeling as something special (for me, having a hard time understanding my own feelings to begin with) and would have liked to share more of a relationship with her than just friendship.

Unfortunately she is very troubled. She is from Israel (came here, to the West 2 years ago, no relatives nearby, only acquaintances and some friends), her birthday is October 7th and this year on that exact day her pet that she had since childhood regrettably passed. She fell out of her usual routine (sports, activities that used to be very important to her) and has barely any savings to survive on. It hurt me a lot to learn these things and see her experience them and I can barely fathom the grieve and worry she must feel. Through our conversations before and around that time I clearly understand that she would not be letting someone into her life until she has herself figured out emotionally and mentally.

Since then she has withdrawn and specifically asked for 'extra space' to recover. We still sometimes see each-other as part of our friend group but it feels like she does acknowledge me as little as possible. These situations are awkward and a bit hurtful to me. We had no conversation or fight that would have caused this, it just happened one day.

I respect her wish and have not made contact for the 3 weeks since we talked last but with every passing day I am hurting more for the passing friendship and person that I deeply care for and am emotionally invested in.I probably have to let go since it is not on me now to make this happen or not. These feelings just linger and come to light every now and then and pull me down bit by bit.

How can I manage to move forward? What do I do if she gets in touch again?

TL;DR: Can't move forward from unresolved feelings for a female friend who is emotionally unavailable and withdrew from our friendship as she is dealing with traumatic events.",0,0.5,1,helioquirumbla,2024-11-13 04:24:33,1gq9v4p,1,Medium
relationships,My (M24) friend talked shit about me to my girlfriend (F24),"Yesterday something shitty happened and i still can't get my mind over it. My friend travelled from my city to another city yesterday, and i lost my bike parking ticket which he was supposed to take to reach to our room in that city. But i made all necessary arrangements to ensure he gets to use my bike by giving him all alternative documents copies. I don't know what he thought but he just got little upset why i lost it and didn't say anything else. 

Now i was in call with my girlfriend of 5 months yesterday night, and my friend called me after reaching his room. My girlfriend suddenly got angry who is calling me at midnight. Even after explaining it's my friend she was doubting me, so i added her also along with my friend for a conference call, as she already knows my friend as well. 

Now he was saying he reached his room, and suddenly out of the blue, he started to speak shit about me. He was saying i lost this ticket, I'm a careless person, i don't know how you are going to survive marrying him, and things like that. I never expected him to speak like this, esp to my girlfriend as we were already in an argument and were getting things back together, and he knew everything about all these things. This made my girlfriend even doubt me more, she was like if you can't even manage simple things, how can you take care of me? 

I just lost my mind yesterday. I knew i was careless losing this ticket, but it's not something to get this angry about and i even made alternative solutions for him so he can have a hassle free process. And its not even necessary to complain to my girlfriend, he could have straight up scolded me. 

I wasn't able to speak any further yesterday. Had huge argument again with my gf after the call and haven't spoken to him yet. 

What should i do now? 

TL; DR : My friend, me and my girlfriend were in a call yesterday, and my friend started talking shit about me to my girlfriend like I'm careless, how she is going to survive marrying me etc. Now my girlfriend is starting to doubt me again, i don't know what to do.

the last 2 weeks in particular has been very rough on our relationship. it started as a fight because he said he was spiralling because i went out for halloween with my friends. i offered support but he admitted he didn't know what i could do to make him feel better so i told him i'll give him space (he's always asked for that everytime he was upset). the next day, he starts accusing me of not loving him, that i never cared about him and that i was selfish because i left him ""high and dry"" and betrayed his trust. he then tells me that nobody's ever hurt him the way i did that night. but i literally asked him what he needed from me and he didn't know either and i tried everything that night- support, reassurance, calling him even though he didn’t pick up bc he was out with friends, but none of it was helping to the point that i genuinely didn't know what else to do. i tried explaining that i wasn't trying to ""leave him high and dry"", i just thought that was what he needed as he usually does. anyway 2 weeks later and he still doesn't trust me or that my feelings are genuine. he said that he senses that things have changed, that i've lost feelings for him and that i don't love him anymore even though none of that is true. again, the reassurance doesn't help because he just doesn't believe me. honestly it's just exhausting at this point because idk what else to do and it feels like im losing my mind trying to prove myself to him.

tbh, im keeping myself this busy so i'll feel less lonely since he's not with me anymore. he doesn't have much friends or a lot of things in uni to keep him busy, hence why our relationship seems very different to us. i've explained that to him but it just made things worse. im tired from work and my hectic life and this isn't making things any better for me. he said he wants someone who is obsessed with him and he's not gonna settle for less. this all feels like it came out of nowhere because i thought we were fine this whole time but apparently he wasn't happy. now im stuck wondering if i'm just a terrible girlfriend/person. how can i gain his trust back?

Earlier last week he was talking about how he was gonna make a big purchase for one of his hobbies and this purchase was around $300-$400 and I told him not to sound like I’m watching what you spend your money on since we don’t live together, but like did you forget that something is coming up? And I mentioned this because he literally hasn’t not brought up any plans or asked me anything about what I wanted to do for my birthday, then he says “oh this saturday I have something planned for you don’t worry about it” so fast forward to Saturday and we were doing something in the morning and I asked him “so what are we doing after this?” and he said that he had a lot of homework left to do so he’s gonna do that, I was like wait what? He told me that he literally had a whole day planned for me for my birthday today? And when I confronted him about this he basically told me “Oh I thought you meant next saturday not this saturday” meanwhile my family (He also knew this) was celebrating my birthday that weekend, so on saturday I was obviously very disappointed and I felt very gaslit honestly, Like how are you gonna say you planned something and then the day of say oh I thought it was the next saturday? Like what? Then today the actual day of my birthday comes and he just has only texted me “good morning” at 3pm and then told me that he was going to be in class for his school.

relationships,UPDATE: My (26M) girlfriend (26F) gave me an ultimatum regarding a group trip,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/og1YFgF3sf

I (26M) wanted to give an update on the situation with my girlfriend (26F) and her ultimatum.

First off, thank you to everyone who commented and reached out. I really appreciated the feedback. It gave me a lot to consider.

I didn’t get a chance to reply to comments, so I’ll address those questions in this update as well.

A lot of people asked how my GF and I even got together. We knew of each other back in high school, but we didn’t move in the same circles. We actually ended up going to the same college and bumped into each other at a party.

So I think that’s where our initial connection began. We were in this big college pond, and having a familiar face from back home made adjusting easier. We didn’t start dating until later, though.

Things felt more like a mutual respect back then. It was after we got together that it was almost like this overnight, complete intolerance.

I was also asked why she considered my friend Violet (28F) a pick-me girl. I honestly don’t know. The definition as I know it doesn’t fit Violet, imo. When I ask my GF, she only says that a woman knows another woman. She won’t elaborate. She never pinpoints specifics.

My GF was known to have a bit of a mean girl side back in high school, tbh. We discussed this before we started dating, and she seemed to work through that in college. But now it feels like that side very much shows whenever it comes to my interests or with anything involving Violet.

In regard to the ultimatum, I went back and forth on what I should do and what I wanted for me individually and for my relationship. I decided to still go on the group trip.

I do believe compromise is part of a relationship, but this ultimatum isn’t that. It’s an attempt to bulldoze in order to have control instead of working together.

I had to ask myself if I did go along with this ultimatum, then what will it lead to? What stops other ultimatums against my interests or whenever she sees fit?

I still wanted to give another shot at working things out, so I had that talk with my GF and let her know of my intentions of going on the trip.

I told her that I understood her feelings and that she does matter to me, but I felt that this ultimatum wasn’t healthy going forward for anyone involved. I again invited her to come on the trip, with her either staying with us at the AirBNB or her and I staying at a hotel, and I thought the trip could be good for us. That was a no-go.

There wasn’t any compromise she was willing to accept. She was still firm on the ultimatum and said she made her position clear, and if I was still going on the trip, then there was nothing more to discuss.

She kept repeating on and off that she hopes choosing Violet was worth it. I told her it had nothing to do with Violet and that she was the one making an entire group trip about Violet. The discourse wasn’t anything productive.

I asked her if she would please reconsider the situation. She said there was nothing to reconsider and that the choice is in my hands. I asked if we could talk again after the con to see how we were feeling, and her exact words were, the only conversation I’ll be having is with the walls because she won’t be in our place anymore when I get back.

Ever since then, she’s barely said a word to me, and my texts are left on read. So, I guess I’m unofficially being given the silent treatment.

I don’t understand why it has to be this way. We should be able to communicate. I don’t feel equally supported, seen, or appreciated in this relationship anymore.

It’s a mess, but a lot of the feedback I received on here and the recent argument has been a wake-up call, and there has to be some kind of change.

I do think the trip would be a nice refresher, and it’s my intent to still go. I don’t believe I’ll be any better off not going, tbh.

Thank you to everyone again.

relationships,"My boyfriend 25M tested positive for chlamydia, and he got it from me 26F. ","
I’m 26F. He’s 25M. Been together for about 4 months now. Long distance relationship. Prior to him, I dated an ex for almost 4 years, and that ex cheated on me lately. I would also get myself tested, but it would always turn out negative. In all, I only had 3 sexual partners before my boyfriend. On the other hand, my boyfriend has had about 15 sexual partners before me. However, he has not had any sexual relations for 2 years before I came along and he regularly gets checked for work. Before he came to see me, he tested negative on all STDs/STIs. After he came to see me, he tested positive for chlamydia. And obviously it most probably came from me considering that I just got out of a relationship with a cheating ex. I do not have any symptoms though.

He just found out today through the doctor. He is upset at how he contracted an STI from me. He was angry. He was angry at how I pestered him once if he was clean, and that it turns out I’m the “unclean” one. But he would say it’s not my fault and I’m not to blame because I equally did not know about it. But would be passive aggressive at me this whole day. I told him I was sorry I gave him a sickness and that next time we should wear a condom. He got offended. He said that I fucking gave him chlamydia and that he has every right to get mad. “You fucking gave me chlamydia”. And he’s complaining about how I’m not letting him be mad. About how I’m making unnecessary comments. About how I’m not being supportive.

I just don’t know what to do or what to feel. A part of me is hurt because I feel like he’s lowkey blaming me for it. And it just hurts on my part too. What should I do? What should I feel? How should I approach the situation? Am I wrong for feeling hurt by his words too?

TL;DR: I unknowingly gave my boyfriend chlamydia, likely from a cheating ex. He initially said it wasn’t my fault, but he’s been passive-aggressive and blames me. I apologized, but he’s upset and says I’m not being supportive. I feel hurt and blamed for something I didn’t know about.",0,0.3,49,Which_Day8507,2024-11-13 09:27:12,1gqfenw,49,High
relationships,"My GF (30) wants to move in with me (26), but I don't feel the same way","
Hi guys, I'm in a difficult situation regarding my current partner. We've known each other for
2y, and have been in a relationship for about 1y. I make much more money than her - about 10x more a year (i live in Latin America, so incomes are much more unevenly distributed, and I happen to have been very lucky to have a really high paying job in my country), Because  of this situation I know that further down the road, I'll be the main/possibly sole provider of our home. I've known this since the beginning, and it has never bothered me - we both have different goals professionally, which have led to different wages, and it's all good. The caveat is that my GF is pushing me to move in together, mainly because she is unhappy about having to share an apartment with other people, while I live alone at a very big apartment in one of the best neighborhoods of my city. She wanted us to move to another neighborhood together, so she could pay part of the rent and share our cost of living expenses, while at the same time improving her life by not having to share an apartment with complete strangers, but with someone she loves. I completely understand why she wants this, and I feel bad for possibly denying her of a better standard of living and life than the one she has. At the same time, I feel like this move to another neighborhood would worsen my life (I didn't want to move from where I am), and I feel like is too early for moving in together, specially in this context when she isn't as financially stable as I am.  Part of the reason for this, is that if it doesn't work out well, I won't be able to move out of our new home, because it would bring trouble to her financially, not mentioning the fact that moving in can be judicially recognized as a Marriage in my Country, and she could ask for a Pension or money after we part ways (we never know). Anyways, am I being overly cautious and insensitive?

Edit: I could pay the rent by myself for both of us, but she insists on paying part of it, that's why we would have to move to another neighborhood - because she could pay a larger share of the rent if it was on a cheaper neighborhood. I think it's good that she wants to help and lift her own weight, but at the same time it's troubling that she can't accept that I can provide better housing for both of us just for the sake of ""making things fair for both of us""

TL;DR: Is it OK to feel insecure about moving in with someone who makes way less money than you, and feel afraid of the possibility that things don't turn out well, but you'll have to keep the relationship because the other part is not as financial independent as you are?",41,0.79,54,Savj98,2024-11-12 04:58:14,1gpi5ap,95,High
relationships,I (24F) think my bf (24M) is attracted to his best friend (24F),"I (24F) think my bf (24M) is attracted to his best friend and I have no idea what to do.

I have been dating this guy for 8 months. In the beginning of our relationship, he told me he has a girl best friend (24F) that is attractive and that when I meet her I shouldn’t be jelaous. I assured him it won’t happen as I am not a jelaous person. 

He used to mention how he likes her femininity as she gets her nails and hair done regularly. I told him I have no money to do that, as I have other stuff I would like to spend my money on. 
He always told me how she is intelligent and attractive. I already expressed my concerns that he gives more compliments to her than to me. He apologised and didn’t mention her for a while, but they hung out regularly and I wasn’t invited. 

I added her to instagram and went through her higlights. I found out they went to his holiday home last year (before we were together) and they swam in the river and rowed in a boat. I didn’t say anything about my findings. He told me himself that there were at his holiday home last year to bring back the wallet he had forgot. However, didn’t mention anything about swimming. He even took photos of her in a bikini she posted (I recognized the location and the tip of paddle of his kayak). The photos were posted on instastory during 3 days.


What is really bothering me is that he practically lied to me (maybe not because she could post photos from the same day on different ones). Also, I feel inferior to her because “she is feminine” and I am not. 

In addition, two days ago I had a really bad time outside as I basically almost passed out twice on the street. I told him as soon as it happened, and yesterday I told him that I was so scared. He got pissed and said “okay how many times are you gonna mention you got dizzy?” And I was like “wtf is wrong with you” as he always mentions that his best friend is in a toxic relationship with her bf and I already heard it on a dozen of other occations (including yesterday). 

I think that girl is using my bf as an ego boost because she always talks to him how her relationship is toxic and asks him for advice. For some reason, I think she is the reason for my bf’s ego boost as she is attractive. I do not want my bf to jump around her, I don’t need him to jump around me neither.
But, if he is gonna jump around another woman, it should be me, and only me.  

TLDR: I feel like my bf is attracted to his best friend because she could come to him with the same problem and he can listen to her all the time. I mention that I was sick twice and he gets fed up with me. He also always mentions positive things about her, but fails to give me a compliment.

ShortScaryStories,My best friend told me she was having a baby. It wasn’t good news.,"I almost couldn’t believe it. Monica was finally expecting a child. 

I should have been happy for her.

Instead, as she rattled off trendy baby names and plans for her dream nursery, I had to bite my tongue.

Monica and I had been best friends for years, ever since we met at grief counseling. My husband had left me after five fruitless years of trying for a baby. She’d lost her fiancé in a motorcycle accident, and miscarried from the stress. The doctors had warned her against trying again. We found common ground in our pain. Two would-be mothers, bonded by children who were never meant to be. 

But that was before Fertilex.

Fertilex Inc. revolutionized family planning. Their fertility clinics guaranteed delivery of a healthy baby, even for women told they could never conceive, with no risk. When news of their success spread across the country, it seemed like a dream come true. There was only one problem.

They catered to the rich.

A Fertilex treatment cost more than I earned in a year. When Monica told me over coffee that she’d made an appointment, I was sure she was joking.

“How?” I chuckled incredulously. “Did you win the lottery?” 

She just smiled and flashed her engagement ring, a gleaming rock the size of an almond.

“My new man. I don’t want to brag, but he’s *loaded*.” She sipped her latte. “And he wants this little miracle as much as I do.” 

We hugged. We laughed. She’d finally done it.  

I cried myself to sleep that night.

Things only got worse as the weeks wore on. Monica was at my apartment every day, always bubbling about her perfect life. While I was stuck working doubles, she got to quit her job. While she shopped for designer cribs, I silently wept for a child I’d never have. Things came to a head one evening as she gushed about Fertilex over a glass of wine. “Maybe one day,” she said, with a smug squeeze of my hand, “they’ll offer services for *less fortunate women*.”  I couldn’t even look at her. The one person who could understand the pain I felt now threw her joy in my face, joy she didn’t deserve.

Maybe if she’d cared about my life, she’d have asked about my new job.

I pushed a mop through the laboratory of the local Fertilex clinic. The security cameras were always turned off during the night shift. I passed bank upon bank of hissing machinery, scouring each one until I finally found it. 

Monica’s baby — gestational age 16 weeks. Vitals were stable and strong. It wriggled, asleep in its plastic womb. 

As I slotted a syringe into the nutrient reserve tank, I told myself that she asked for this. I sank the plunger, injecting Monica’s miracle with a cocktail of whisky and thalidomide. 

In a few months, Monica’s joy would turn to ash in her mouth. Maybe then she’d finally remember what brought us together in the first place. 

Grief.

ShortScaryStories,My son got called into the principal's office. What he did made me sick to my stomach.,"When I got to the principal’s office, he gingerly placed a small sandwich bag onto his desk. Inside was half a dozen bloody teeth.



“Miss Boyd, Marcus went around at recess hunting down anybody with a loose tooth. He ripped these all out and stole them for himself.”



“I am so sorry,” I said, “he’s never done anything like this before.”



“It’d be best if Marcus went home for the day.”



“Yes, of course, I’ll take him right now.”



I got up to leave, but the principal stopped me.



“Would you mind taking the teeth with you,” he said, “if I look at them any longer I’m gonna hurl.”



“Sure,” I said,



The drive home was silent. I wanted to yell at Marcus, but at the same time I knew this was partially my fault.



Yesterday Marcus lost his final baby tooth, but I didn’t have any change for the “tooth fairy.” All I had in my purse was a twenty, so I thought, *What the hell!* It’s his final tooth, so why not give him the twenty.



The money must have gone to his head. He had taken enough teeth at school to get over a hundred dollars.



“Marcus,” I said, “you’re old enough now that I think you should know there’s no such thing as the tooth fairy.”



“Yes there is,” Marcus said, scowling.



“No, baby, Mommy’s the one who puts money under your pillow at night.”



“I saw her.”



“What?” He was fast asleep when I put the money under his pillow.



“She made me get her more teeth. She said she’d hurt me if I didn’t.”



“Marcus, this isn’t funny. The tooth fairy isn’t real, and what you did at school was cruel. Go to your room and think about what you did.”



“Fine,” Marcus cried, and ran out of the car.



I went inside and realized I still had the bag of teeth in my pocket. I threw it away in the kitchen and got on with my day.



That night I had a terrible nightmare.



I was lying down in bed when someone small opened the door. At first I thought it was Marcus, but then I saw their face. White and angular, with an impossibly large smile that went ear to ear. She wore a white dress, had white hair, and white eyes with no pupils.



I wanted to get up, but I was paralyzed. She jumped onto the bed and crawled onto my chest.



She opened my mouth, reached in, and grabbed one of my teeth, then pulled!



I woke up screaming. I put my fingers in my mouth, but thankfully my teeth were all there.



*That was fucked up*.



I went downstairs to make myself a cup of tea and shake off the nightmare.



When I threw the tea bag into the trash I heard something.



A *clinking* that could only be one thing.

ShortScaryStories,"I’ve always been the outsider of the village, ever since what happened. ","Growing up where I grew up, I was always the outsider. 

I never got on with the other children in the village. The children that have now grown up to be the policemen. The shopkeepers. The butchers. The village itself. 

We’re a - they’re a - small community in rural Scotland. Barely 400 people. 800 eyes looking at me every time I’d go to town for food. 

My mother hasn’t been able to go for some years now. Her health becoming so bad she can hardly walk.

Bless her. 

My father was the one who causes this. He was an ‘adulterer’. He was once the husband of Victoria McIntyre, son of Donald McIntyre - the ‘royals’ of our small community. He impregnated one of the village ‘whores’, my mother, and caused Victoria to kill herself. My father fled, leaving myself and my mother to become the victims of their anger. 

Scowled at. 

Spat at. 

Shouted at. 

Punched. 

Kicked. 

Tripped. 

Hospitalised. 

We couldn’t leave as no one would buy our house. Money was tight. This is all we knew. Hours away from the nearest city and miles from the nearest other town. 

The only work I could get was on the gas line that runs through the village. An old dangerous thing that could blow at any moment. It’s filthy work and it’s a one man job. That’s why I got it I suppose. 

That’s when I got the call from my mother. She felt terrible. She needed medical assistance. I’d raced to tell the village doctor, who said so dismissively:

“Here’s some sleepy pills. Tell her to take a few and she’ll be fine.”

I ran to the local fire service, I’m sure they’d know CPR. Mike McClaughlin laughed as he sipped his tea. 

“Ha! Our fire engines out of order. Not that we’d waste fuel going to your cursed little place anyway.”

I flagged down a local policeman. 

“Huh. Who was there for Victoria McIntyre when she died? That’s what I thought.”

By the time I returned home she’d passed. Her cold body, dead on the floor. 

I returned to the village only hours later. Just after I’d buried her, finishing my work on the gas line. I remember my mother always warning my teachers and classmates when I was at school. She’d come in to pick me up after I’d been beaten senseless again by the other children, and say with tears streaming down her face:

“You know, the child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth.”

I chuckled as I remember this. As I lit the fuse that would ignite the gas line. As I thought about the sleeping pill Doctor Graham had given me that I’d slipped into Fireman Mclaughlin’s tea. As the explosion rung out. As the screams of the villagers burning alive, with no one coming to their aid, soothed my ears like a breath of fresh air.

ShortScaryStories,He Tried to Save His Family. I Wasn’t About to Let That Happen.,"I ensured Jacob still saw it all when he closed his eyes: the skid of tires, the shatter of glass, the silence after the crash.

His parents glanced back just for a second. Then—impact.

I had him thrown from the car, slamming into the road—I wanted him to survive after all. His legs were crushed as the car toppled onto him.

Mom, Dad, little Julian—all of them were gone.

It was hit-and-run. The driver’s car was found empty, the driver presumably having fled the scene.

**I knew better.**

That was 20 years ago.

The lab lights flicker and dim—the machine consumes a massive amount of power. Jacob steps into the chamber of the machine.

I could hear his thoughts:

*Today, I’m going to undo it.*

*It had to be fate that I survived, right?*

I chuckle. Who else but **me**?

*A sign that I was meant to find a way back, that I was meant to fix this. And now, I have.*

*This is the moment I’ve been waiting for.*

But not like **I** have—not even close.

*“Any attempt to alter the past, even the smallest thing, could ripple outward in ways we can’t predict.”*

*“The butterfly effect, don’t you understand? The consequences could—no, would—be drastic.”*

I made sure he ignored every warning.

*""Besides, the machine might not even work—it's all just theory.”*

Oh, I would **ensure** it worked. To witness what’s to come

He types in the date he’d etched into his mind.

The machine pulsed around him, his vision blurred, and his body felt like it was dissolving.

When the sensations pass, and his vision clears, he’s standing in the middle of a busy street.

Twenty years back. The newspaper on a nearby stand confirms it.

A glance at the watch told him he hadn’t much time.

Quickly, he found the cheapest rental car he could afford and sped toward the intersection.

The minutes ticked down on his watch.

*I’ll save them.*

I stifled a laugh. Not yet—it’s too soon. The best part is still to come

He neared the intersection. There—up ahead—his family’s car rolled toward the light. I made sure he saw them all—those sweet memories. It would make what came next even better.

The light turned red.

He slammed the brakes, but the pedal went slack under his foot. He stomped the pedal again.

Nothing.

In desperation, he yanked the handbrake.

The car kept charging forward.

His family’s car glided into the intersection.

“No, no, no—!”

The sound of the crash, the screams of desperation, pain and fear.

Ah… *music* to my ears.

I make sure he hears their screams before I pull him back to the present.

Jacob scrambles to turn the machine back on, but it’s lifeless now. 

I won’t let him change a thing.

His purpose is served.

To think he could rewrite what I’ve already written.

**Such blasphemy is intolerable.**

Toying with humans—how could I ever tire of it?

ShortScaryStories,There's something wrong with the children I'm babysitting.,"I definitely *wasn't* seeing things.

The advertisement was a babysitting job for *children*.

Something ice-cold slipped down my spine. Children were a rarity. I was part of the Last Generation, the final natural babies born before women across the country suddenly became barren.

Growing up, I was kidnapped three times.

Child abductions became normal, with women taking children for themselves, nicknamed The Red Witches.

The babysitting job caught my attention since children, or at least natural children, no longer existed.

Mrs. Mirai, the mother, was holding an actual child.

Naturally born, without the weird blue light around the iris signaling a laboratory birth.

A tiny six-year-old boy with fluffy hair and freckles, who scowled at me when I couldn't resist waving at him.

He was so cute! 

I immediately felt maternal instinct. 

His mother was a tired-looking woman in her late thirties, chastising him for pulling faces. “Arthur, what did I say about being rude?” she said, and the boy grumbled something into her shoulder.

I was gestured inside and introduced to the other children—a ponytailed blonde and a little boy hiding behind the door—as Adelaide and Aiden.

Mrs. Mirai left me with a strawberry shake as a thank you.

The kids refused to eat their dinner, so I gave up.

Arthur wouldn't leave me alone, throwing tantrums.

He violently knocked the shake from my hand. “Stupid, stupid, stupid!”

I chuckled. “What is stupid, sweetie?”

“Fuck… Mommy.” Arthur grumbled. “Fuck…Mom-ey!”

His hands clenched into fists, and my stomach twisted. I had a feeling little Arthur Mirai wasn't Mrs. Mirai’s actual son.

“Can’t… can’t remember… why… here… why am I here?”

Arthur clawed at my arm, his face tomato red. “Can't… remem…ber.”

Adelaide came running over, too, and Aiden wrapped his arms around me in a hug.

“Okay.” I kept my voice down, ignoring my head briefly spinning off-kilter. “Go get your things. I'll get you out of here.”

The three nodded, running upstairs.

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen.

The phone was disconnected, because of course it was.

“We’re here!” a voice startled me, and I stumbled into the main hallway.

Three grown adults, wearing the expressions of frightened children, were holding stuffed toys and coloring pads.

Before I could question them, there were footsteps outside. I dragged the three “kids” into the downstairs bathroom, slamming the door behind us.

Mrs. Mirai was on the phone.

“That'll be 500k for the three,” she said.

“Six years old, yes! Hmm? Oh, original age? Twenty. Yes, the Last Generation. But I've wiped them completely; the poor darlings are blank slates. *Perfect* babies.""

She paused, and my head spun, milkshake creeping back up my throat.

I slumped to my knees suddenly, the kids’ eyes going wide.

“*Oh, fuck!*” Arthur mouthed, slamming his hand over his mouth.

He dropped to my height, squeezing my hands. 

“Don't leave us!"" 

“Oh, and I'll throw in another!” Mrs. Mirai laughed. “Female. Soon to be six years old. You've got yourself a deal!”",120,0.98,3,Trash_Tia,2024-11-13 16:53:18,1gqq236,123,High
ShortScaryStories,My Son Brings Me Flowers,"My son is the sweetest boy you’d ever meet. Always sensitive and imaginative, and lately, he’s been even more lovely! He brings me flowers every day-lovely, vibrant blooms with soft petals and a heavenly scent. I asked him once where he got them, and he just giggled and said, “The fairies show me where to get them!” before running off to play in the woods. Most children his age are playing video games and turning violent, but not my boy. No screen time for him and look how he’s turning out! The imagination he has! 

The flowers, and my boy’s imaginative passion for life, are the only comforts I cling to now. My health is ever fragile, baffling doctors. Some days, I’m too tired to cook, but my sweet boy never lets me feel bad. He just smiles and says, “Don’t worry, Mommy, I can have tea with the fairies!” Oh! To be young again! My aging body fails me, but seeing how strong he grows every day brings a smile to my face. 

Tonight is a special night- his eighth birthday. I’m tired, but I won’t let my baby down today! I made all his favorites earlier: whole grain macaroni and cheese with organic cheese and nutritional yeast, baked chicken tenders, and broccoli. When he walked in the door, I expected a big smile! Instead, I was met with a furrowed brow, a frown, and a bouquet of flowers. He handed me the flowers and told me that fairies would never eat food like this and requested I make him a meal of cakes and cookies, with milk and honey to wash it down! I couldn’t believe my ears! I’ve never given him such things in his life! 

I pleaded with him, but he insisted saying, “I’ll go play with the fairies, you make the sweets.” He bounded for the door, turning at the last moment to say, “and mom? Don't forget to smell the flowers I brought you!”  

He’s so considerate, and I make sure to smell the bouquet before fixing it in a vase. 

The table is set, the treats made. Tired, I lie down and rest until my precious boy is ready to eat. I can hear him playing his fairy games outside, his laughter like chimes in a gentle breeze. I drift off to sleep. 

“You have a very special boy here,” my eyes fly open, it’s dark out, I rub my eyes trying to see what’s before me- a beautiful woman with wings, and she has her arm around my baby. 

“Wh-who are-” is all I manage before she cuts me off. 

“Ssshh,” she says, “Your time is almost up. Your life is almost drained, and soon, he will be our prince.” 

She cups her hands lovingly on my baby’s cheeks. He gazes up at her with those sweet precocious eyes, “I made sure she smelled the flowers,” he says to her, “Did I do good?” ",109,1.0,3,egomystic,2024-11-13 12:11:53,1gqje37,112,High

Looks like an alien ship I joke. I hear a thud and head over to check on the main hub. I see the blip is closing in fast.

ShortScaryStories,"Miss Smith and the new Classroom Technology
","As Miss Smith fiddled with the VR equipment, a ripple of excitement went through the class. Miss Smith smiled to herself- so nice to see the children excited about a history lesson. Amazing what technology could bring to the classroom.

“Ok kids, so we’ll be using our equipment to travel back to 1916. Do we remember what happened then?”

The regular keeners, Lucy and Greg put up their hand. They knew of course. With her usual cruel deliberation, Miss Smith picked on Maddie, a shy tormented girl who hated speaking up. “Maddie?”

Maddie wriggled and a painful scarlet flooded her face. Miss Smith sighed. “We’ve been over this Maddie! Well, never mind. What we are going to experience together will make sure we never forget. Remember to Look, Listen, and Remember. We’ll do a little quiz on WW1 when you’re done. Pick up your headsets please class, and plug them in according to the instructions we went over. It doesn’t hurt at all!”

The kids did as they were told, some more cool than others. Several had already used the technology in other classrooms, but it was still new to most. Miss Smith watched with satisfaction as they slid the smooth slim devices up their nostrils deep into their brains, and then switched on her panel.

Their eyes went blank as their reality became 1916, on the banks of the river Somme.

It was fun, watching their little bodies shudder and shake. and listening to their cries of distress and agony. Idly, and without thinking much, Miss Smith touched the panel again, bringing the intensity level up to 4. The recommended number was 2.

The cries grew louder. Miss Smith typed in some new instructions, she couldn’t help chuckling at the sight of the kids frantically miming trying to put on gas masks for dear life. This was amazing. She dialled it up a notch.

Lucy fell to the floor, doubled up and shrieking in agony, holding her shoulder where she felt her arm being ripped off. Greg was foaming at the mouth- an amazing example of how the human body produces real chemical reactions to virtual stimuli. Maddie had already curled into a ball, hiding her head.

Miss Smith looked at her timer. Another ten minutes. She dialled up to six.

The screams of the kids pierced the classroom ceiling. Almost all of them were on the ground now, shuddering and flailing wildly. Greg was sobbing hysterically, calling out for his mom. Lucy seemed to have gone catatonic, and was lying motionless, her eyes wide open and staring.

Reluctantly, Miss Smith felt they had enough. She should dial it down slowly. They had been trained to not switch off suddenly.

Something was off. She jabbed the panel a few more times, but the intensity number didn’t change. A red light flashed on the panel.

With some agitation, she pressed a few more buttons but nothing changed. Sighing, she dialled tech support, while the children’s screams continued before her.",192,0.99,12,1000andonenites,2024-11-13 06:27:44,1gqbqoi,204,High
ShortScaryStories,I am an N.P.C.,"I'm an NPC, I'm sure of it. I know this because, well, nothing ever happens to me. I go through life, I have friends and family, but, I'm nothing more than a prop. I've never broken a bone, had an akward mishap that led to a great story arc, nothing. At this point, I'm convinced that I can't even die unless it lends to someone elses arc. As soon as my usefulness as a plot device ends so do I, and no one will even remember I lived in the first place. Going to the coffee shop for instance, I see people all around me who are actively living out their stories. People doing interesting things, going to crazy places, having experiences and stories about those experiences and wowing everyone with their day to day life. Me, I have none of that. 

One time, when I was young, my famliy went to the Grand Canyon, and there was this other family there, just standing by one of those plaques that has information about a rock formation or something. I felt like I was on a movie set, watching the other kids running around and overhearing conversations between people. I however, I was just, there. Anyway, someone slipped, the mom that was with the other family. She went straight down, smashing in to rocks and fading out of sight as she plummeted. Everyone was panicking, screaming, running in circles trying to decide who to call and what to do. The rest of her family looked on in horror as I just stood there, unfeeling, not reacting to the chaos, just observing. I wasn't a part of that story other than as a background character. Another body to fill out the tourist attraction to make it feel more alive than if it were just that one family there alone. 

It's like when you look at Instagram or TikTok, all these people making connections and sharing real, lived experiences. I'd be lucky to show up in the background and maybe someone would know I exist even for a moment. Again, when I was waiting for a train at the Oakland B.A.R.T. platform, some guy just jumped in front of the train. Again, I just sat there on the bench, no feelings, no reaction, no reason to do anything other than sit and watch as the few main characters that were there acted to stop the train, to jump down on the tracks and pull up the mangled remains of the guy who watched his own credits roll. Even now as I sit in this room at the mental hospital, with some main character, some therapist, trying to get me to admit to tripping that attractively dressed man just as a taxi was rushing by, pushing that man on to the tracks at the station. What can I say, though? I'm just an N.P.C., no one of consequence, I'm just here to drive other peoples arcs.",20,0.89,3,Pooterboodles,2024-11-13 16:29:00,1gqpi79,23,High
ShortScaryStories,Closed Eyes,"I tossed the ball across the room.

*Bu-dum-dum-dum-dum*

The sound of the ball against the cabin's hardwood floors was easily my favorite. Reaching to my left, I picked up what my parents described as the ""best"" transformer. Clicking a button in on its back, I chucked the lump of plastic up in the air.

""Auto-bot's rollou-"" Optimus Prime was cut off by a *thunk* and a skid, sliding until finally meeting the back wall of the empty cabin with another light *thunk*.

I reached back to my left, scanning for toys but found none. Pondering what to do next while I waited for my parents, I stood up from the wall adjacent to the toys I had thrown.

The books I brought had mainly been the practice books my braille instructor wanted me to read throughout the summer. I *really* did not feel like going through those a fifth time.

My hands fumbled for the mobility cane I used to get around, but then I thought otherwise. This cabin was small enough that I could get around just fine.

*Tap-tap-tap*

The tapping of glass came from my right. I *think* that was where the front door was; that side of  
the room was where Mom and Dad had left to get groceries.

Stepping precariously, avoiding my toys strewn around the room, I felt forward for the door. My hand met the round metal doorknob; standing still, I listened intently.

*Tap-tap-tap*

This time I knew; someone was tapping on the glass. Turning the knob, I swung the door open.

""Mom... Dad?"" My ears were met with silence.

Maybe a bird had been tapping on the glass?

A small whisper of a voice came out from somewhere in front of me, ""*Over here.*""

I stepped out onto the front porch, feeling the warmth of the sun hit my skin, ""Hello?"".

The thin whisper replied, ""*Hey kid, come over here.""*

The voice sent goosebumps down my arms and a sudden chill came over me. Reaching back for the doorknob I yanked myself back into the cabin. With all my strength I swung the door shut with a loud *bang.* The force used to shut the door threw me off balance and I fell on my butt.

*Tap-tap-tap*

I pushed myself on my bottom, across the cabin floor till I met the back corner.

The front door creaked as it swung inward. A loud *plop* hit the hardwood as something fell through the door.

*Screak-pause-screak-pause-screak-pause*

I could sense whatever it was getting closer as it inched itself across the floor, sounding like a chair  
being dragged.

*Screak-pause-screak*

My heart raced and thumped loudly in my eardrums as it grew nearer. The warmth of someone - something - emanated right in front of my face. Hot, heavy sulfur breath hit my nostrils as a gravelly voice spoke inches away.

""That's strange."" it remarked, ""Usually little boys *close* their eyes before I gobble them up.""",57,0.98,5,Cal_Tin,2024-11-13 10:56:02,1gqhiqa,62,High
ShortScaryStories,"I Ruined My Sister's Wedding, But She Deserved It","“What do you mean you’ve been sleeping with my boyfriend?” I snapped.

“Was sleeping with him,” my sister, Alice, corrected me, “I broke it off with him months ago.”

“Why are you telling me this now?”

“Because I want to get married with a clear conscience,” was her reply.

“Does that mean you told Brad?” That was her fiancé’s name.

“No, I haven’t,” she shook her head, “And I’m not going to.”

Hearing her reply confirmed my suspicions that she was lying about her motivation for telling me.

“You’re not trying to clear your conscience,” I pointed an accusing finger at her, “You just don’t want me to be a part of the wedding.”

“That’s not it,” she said unconvincingly.

“Whatever,” I stormed out of her apartment, slamming the door behind me.

The first thing I did after I left was confront my boyfriend.

He tried to lie about the affair at first but changed his story once I told him that my sister had already confessed.

He begged for forgiveness and tried to pin the blame on Alice, saying she was the one who initiated things, but I didn’t care.

*It takes two to tango*, was the last thing I said to him.

The next week was a series of emotional highs and lows for me until I decided that I wasn’t going to let my sister get away with what she’d done.

After everything we’d been through over the years, she’d finally crossed a line and I was going to make sure she paid for it.

Under the pretense of wanting to put things behind us, I reached out to Alice and invited her over to my apartment to make amends.

When she got there, I told her that it was over between my boyfriend and me and that we should celebrate.

She readily agreed and accepted the drug-laced drink I handed her.

“That was too easy,” I said as I dragged her corpse into the bedroom where the body of my ex-boyfriend lay in a spreading pool of blood on the floor.

Before I positioned her body on the bed, I swapped the clothes I was wearing with the clothes she was wearing.

Since we were twins, nobody would be able to tell that it wasn’t my body in the bed.

Now that the scene was set, I went back to Alice’s apartment to enact the rest of my plan.

“How was your sister?” Brad asked when I walked through the door.

“I don’t know,” I replied, “She never answered the door.”

“That’s weird,” he replied, “Why did she invite you over if she wasn’t going to be there?”

“It is weird,” I agreed, “Do you think I should call someone to check on her?” I asked.

“Nah,” he shook his head, “You know how crazy she is. It’s probably best to just forget about her.”

“Yeah,” I smiled, “You’re probably right.”",2038,0.99,21,k_g_lewis,2024-11-12 13:07:07,1gpsl7z,2059,High
ShortScaryStories,Old MacDonald had a cow…,"Watch him slick with black grease in the innards of a tractor. A man. George MacDonald. 

Down yonder running rampant with youth and grifter’s pretty comes the fieldhand. Eddie. The boy grins like a fishhook. He says:

*You’ll be pleased with the Missus I’d wager.*

The boy is a menace. 

*Whycome Eddie?*

*Why indeed sir.*

Eddie’s damned fool riddle unravels in a straining of buttons down the bust of the wife. Clara MacDonald. She says she can’t explain it. He stares at her breasts mute and stupid as a newborn babe. Suddenly ravenous. Implacably bothered. He tells her to draw the curtains and lock the doors. She obliges. 

Now he cannot help himself. Every glimpse of her is a fresh provocation. And she grows more buxom and she moans roughly. In the bedroom and field and hayrick. Feral. Fucking relentlessly. Fucking blindly. They knock a lantern over in the barn and the straw catches and Myrtle the milk cow burns alive. Her calf is orphaned. 

*Maybe you could*. George says. *It’d be a kindness is all.*

*I’ll try it. Once*. 

With swollen breasts she nurses the calf. Milk comes against all reason. She sighs bright and weightless. The next day she nurses and the next. A week nursing. 

Now she is eating grass in the field to keep her milk healthful. She roams naked under the shade trees. Never coming in to bathe or dress or sup. 

Grass and motherhood.  

George and Eddie watch her wordlessly from the porch. Her boundless wild beauty. Yet more provocation. Winding tight. As a brindle bull comes and sniffs at her and makes to mount her. As she moos her acquiescence. George goes running. 

*No damn you! Enough! You are my wife not a godforsaken cow!*

The bull spooks and trots away. Clara nods. But come evening she suckles the calf and George sees and dashes the creature’s brains out with an axe. She is his wife. His wife. His. 

The next morning she bathes and dresses and milks herself into the basin drain. She goes to church on Sunday and sings the hymns. She knits beside the radio after supper. For the first night in some time the MacDonalds share a bed. 

Then under the drowsy black cap of midnight with quiet seething from each shadow he wakes. Alone. 

Clara is nowhere in the house. The field is vacant. The soot fanged ruin of the old barn is all he doesn’t search first. Its pocked timbers lean in the light of his lantern and George MacDonald staggers. He goes ashen from the sight of so much blood. The glistening red-worm heap of meat. His wife smiling serenely up at him. 

*Hello husband. I remember. I remember that I’m a wife. And I remembered we’re needing beef.*

She shifts and flesh rips and she lifts her remaining breast into the mouth of the meat grinder below her. She grasps the handle and it slowly begins to turn. Softly chirping:

They are the tingle down your spine on a lonely night at home, the pit of chilling anticipation as you read this story. Oh, dearest reader, that pitch-black seed of dread you feel deep inside was planted many, many years ago; now, the time has come to reap what was sown.

They’ve crept ever so closer, haven’t they? Every time you turn around, you catch a glimpse of something—darker than night itself—but no matter how fast you turn, you just aren’t quite quick enough to catch it. Was that a breath down your neck, or just a figment of your traitorous imagination?

The heartbeat in your ears sounds like the quiet thud of footsteps, creeping closer, closer. I already told you, it’s no use; turn as fast as you can—you will never catch more than an inkling, the faintest possibility of movement. They await you in the darkest corner of every room, teetering over the line of imagination, into the deepest crevice of your very soul.

ShortScaryStories,The weight of Royal Rubies ," Bodies littered the battlefield, faces mangled beyond recognition. The metallic stench of blood hung heavy, choking me. I searched desperately for any sign of life among the corpses—someone alive, someone with the faint sound of a heartbeat and a breath. 


As I stood alone, winning the war as the unbeatable general, the sin of all the murders weighed heavily on my shoulders.

_  _ _

The king's praise echoed through the grand halls: ""If it weren't for you, we would have fallen, Leo."" 


His smile gleamed with hollow glory. But amidst laughter and cheers, I felt revulsion.

 Food tasted like ashes. Thousands of my soldiers had perished, leaving only a handful.

The justice minister handed me sweets with a smirk. I turned away, seeing a skeletal child reaching out, eyes hollow with hunger.
 _ _ _


That night, my nanny gasped, ""Are you hurt, Leo?"" Footsteps echoed, and I turned, ready to shield her. A soldier, no older than 15, with half his face missing, reached toward me.

Visions haunted me: young and old, pleading, accusing. I couldn't pretend normalcy. The words chased me: ""You bear the burden of your sins."" But I knew it was the king's sin, not mine.

The king gifted me heaps of unique rubies and diamonds, more than I could use in a lifetime. But no honor, no wealth, no praise could cleanse me of this. They needed justice. I planned his demise.

The king trusted me. As I approached the throne, I pondered: stab, poison, or strangle? Poison was silent. 

As I handed him wine, he drank unsuspectingly, and his eyes widened. His body convulsed, and he collapsed.

I dragged his lifeless form through a hidden passageway, stashing him in an old rosewood cupboard —one the queen had scorned after injuring herself on it. I tied his hands, shut the doors, and watched as servants disposed of it, burning it to ash.

One week passed; visions ceased. I knew I'd done right. But then, a royal summons came.

I returned to the palace, frozen. The king sat, alive, smiling. Familiar rubies glistened in his skin like grotesque tattoos.

He held out the same glass of wine, whispering, ""You bear the burden of your sins."" His voice echoed coldly.

I tried to move back, but my feet wouldn't budge. His skin gleamed, each ruby holding faces—soldiers, villagers, children—staring back at me with accusing eyes.

My fallen men, the innocent, all melded into his flesh. ""All that death, all that destruction, and you thought you'd walk away unscathed?""

He rested a hand on my shoulder; an unnatural heat spread from his touch. My skin burned as rubies emerged beneath it, each gem carrying a face, a life I'd taken.

They pulsed, their weight embedding into my bones, until I could no longer stand. His laughter echoed through the room, his ruby-studded skin reflecting mine.

I collapsed under the weight, writhing as the room filled with the cries of the dead.",32,1.0,3,0hShaSha,2024-11-13 10:27:44,1gqgucl,35,High

Modern build. 

*Sliding glass doors. Four bedrooms. Free Wi-Fi.*

But it *stunk* of lavender. 

My roommates were friendly. 

Early twenties. 

Jonas was handsome, dark brown hair and freckles, but extremely awkward. 

I made the mistake of greeting him one morning, and he stood, startled, like a deer caught in headlights. Stella, a pretty redhead, locked herself in her room.

Rudy was the final roommate, sandy blonde hair and freckles. 

He spent four hours trying to justify the earth being flat. 

All three were *introverted.*

The next day, however, I woke in Jonas’s bed, in lavender scented bedsheets. 

“Good morning,” his head was nestled in my shoulder, and I found my body moving without me, leaning forward and kissing him. No matter how much my body told me something was *wrong*, that I had to get *out*, somehow, a playful laugh escaped my numb lips when his mouth slipped down my torso, and somehow it felt *good*. 

I knew it wasn't *supposed* to. 

I barely knew this man, or how and why I was in his bed. But it felt… *good*. 

Jonas wore a lazy smile, eyes half lidded. “Breakfast?” 

Downstairs, Rudy and Stella were in the kitchen, their arms wrapped around each other. 

Again, two strangers who barely spoke to each other. 

“Well, look who it is,” Stella grinned. She smelled of lavender. “It's the lovebirds!”

Jonas snatched a slice of toast. “Well, maaaaybe we’re just better.”

“Really?” Rudy smirked. “Are we *really* having this conversation?”

I found myself laughing, but I didn't know *why* I was laughing.

I kept laughing. 

Days went by. 

Weeks. 

Months. 

I woke up in Jonas's bed with a giant grin on my face.

Sometimes Rudy’s.  

I stopped noticing I was bleeding, and that we were drowning in... 

Lavender.

*Blood*. 

Dripped down my chin, warm and wet. 

I got bigger, my belly expanding, my smile widening, my thoughts... 

*My thoughts...*

I gave birth  choking on lavender, inside the basement, surrounded by infant screams. Everywhere I looked, babies in cots lining each wall. 

A woman loomed over me, her lips grazing my ear.

“Don't worry, Eve.” she whispered, cradling my little one. Stella was across the room, writhing under velcro straps. 

The shadowy woman's voice was gentle, telling her to *push!*

“You're part of something beautiful.”

I was pulled from the bed, the stitches in my stomach barely healed. 

“You've all done so well with providing me with children, so far. Mommy is so proud.”

Needles pricked my skull, and I was dragged back upstairs. 

A guy was shoved next to me, his eyes were blank. Adam. 

I remembered when he was Lucas. 

Kye. 

Roman. 

Caine. 

Jonas. 

Another *Adam* stumbled into me, dead eyes staring forwards. 

An *Eve*, who could barely walk straight, clumsy stitches holding her belly together. 

*Lavender* choked the air, and my brain turned to...

ShortScaryStories,Mrs. Nesbitt,"“Eat your fill, gentlemen. There’s always plenty to go around,” the old woman said.

She carefully pushed a cart between the tables; a pot of stew sat atop it. As the men raised their hands she promptly walked over and filled up their bowls.

“You treat us too well, Mrs. Nesbitt,” one of the men said, his mouth still full.

Another man concurred, “Your food is the bomb.”

“Oh boys, you don’t need to suck up to get refills,” she said with a giggle. “All I ask is that you finish what you’ve been given.”

The men nodded and continued eating.

As the hour went on, the pot grew lighter and lighter. More people finished their meals and patted their stomachs. All the men obediently brought their dishes to the appropriate bins for cleaning before heading out onto the streets to find a place to sleep for the night. Only a few men remained at the tables when the pot ran dry.

“Ope, looks like that’s all she wrote for tonight, fellas,” she said scooping the last remnants into a man’s bowl. “But if you’re still hungry I can put together some to-go bags of snacks that we keep in the back.”

Several men nodded and followed her. She grabbed some plastic bags and filled them with various items she pulled from the shelves. Each man lined up and graciously took a bag before leaving.

The final man lagged behind; he walked slowly and eyed everything. By the time he’d made it up to her, the 2 were all alone.

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a knife, flinging it open effortlessly.

“Where the fuck is the donation jar, bitch?” he spat. He shoved her up against the shelves and she groaned in pain.

“W-we don’t have one. We get cans and food, toiletries, we don’t take cash,” she replied. She held her hands up defensively and they trembled.

The man backhanded her and she yelped as tears welled up in her eyes.

“Don’t think I wont cut you, bitch. You’re nothin’ to me. I ain’t leavin’ here without your life or some money, now cough up!”

He pressed the knife against her throat and she winced as the blade drew some blood.

“F-fine, I’ll show you,” she said and moved toward a cabinet in the corner. She reached to open it but the man shoved her aside and did it himself. He quickly pulled out a lock box and purse he found inside.

The man felt a sharp stabbing pain in his neck and he dropped what he was carrying, quickly reaching up. A hypodermic needle hung limply from his throat and he stumbled sideways, his vision blurring.

“W-whaaat thhhee fuck dijjj you do?” he slurred.

He collapsed to the floor and the room spun around him. Mrs. Nesbitt stepped forward and leered over him.

We have always wondered about the place; other stores in the strip mall either persevered for years, or closed up shop and was soon replaced by, invariably, another forgettable shop that is bound to repeat the experience soon after. We call those stores to be in a cursed spot.

But one store was different. It always looked dingy but never derelict; closed but never shut down. It didn't even have an ""open"" sign. And above it hung an old sign that simply said, with Dominican flag missing the center insignia--""Dominican.""

That was it. Any signs of whether it used to be a restaurant, hair salon, or something else entirely was completely gone.

And in the night, the sign never lit up.

Some of us got curious about the store and did a bit more than just wonder what it was. Mark apparently decided to spend an entire day at the strip mall trying to see if anyone went in or out of the place--no dice. Caity was convinced it was one of those illicit massage parlors that specialized in happy endings, but only because the windows and door were both blacked out; even if you leaned against the windows to see if you could see inside, the only thing you could see was the black wrap.

But one day--the sign was lit.

---

It was lit for days. Day, night, it didn't matter. It remained on, almost like a beacon, a lamp to lure the mosquitoes to their certain demise if they got too close. The uneven florescent backing light only added to a certain mystery that at least some people couldn't help but want to reveal.

After a while, a rumor started emerging. Something about aura, feeling of unease. One of the kids in our group proclaimed: ""It must be because of that Dominican place; I'm going to check it out.""

Again, we thought nothing of it; most of us are not that curious, and are happy to let a certain urban mystery be just that--a mystery.

That night, the sign's lights turned off.

---

Everything seemed to turn back to normal; the aura that some swore they were feeling were gone. Less and less people talked about it, if they did at all. But I noticed something that nobody talked about: the kid that said they would check out the place was nowhere to be found.

Some did not even remember the kid existed; others frowned as they tried to remember anything more than the existence of the kid. There were, however, some talks about hearing screams in the middle of the night when the strip mall was empty.

We never did find out if that was actually our imagination or not, or if the kid has existed. But the store remains--with the sign light off.",14,0.86,0,kindofharmless,2024-11-13 11:53:45,1gqixn7,14,High
ShortScaryStories,Mooseknuckle,"I woke up in the middle of the night and had to pee. 

It was dark, and the creeping chill in the guestroom of the AirBnB made me shiver once I crawled out from the covers. As I crept over the creaking floorboards, I looked back at my wife, still sleeping softly in the moonlight that spilled from the window near the bed.

Good.

We had a big day ahead of us tomorrow, and I would've felt bad if my aggravated prostate had ruined her sleep on our vacation. Everything had been going so well—the place was cheap, we effectively christened our fresh linen like we hadn't in months back home, and there was the cave.

The cave.

I thought about it as I left the room, and navigated the quaint hall that led to the bathroom. I could hear the wind against old lumber, my bare feet on the floor.

The bathroom light is bright, but welcoming.

We had planned on hiking. I hoped for kindled romanticism and risqué sex amongst nature, but that changed once we saw the brambles clustered against the hill.

Like someone had blocked it up intentionally.

I groaned against the difficult push, until relief trickled. We cleared the bramble—old sticks and dried leaves much like a beaver dam—just before dark. We decided we'd check it out first thing in the morning right after coffee.

I mean, they wouldn't rent the place if it was dangerous, right?

I flush, washed my hands in the old sink, and kill the light.

I hear it immediately. The slow drag of old painted wood, the heavy clip-clop of hooves. I can feel the weight of it in the hall, like it's bearing down the floor of the bedroom. 

Where I left her sleeping.

I hurry back, blindly bounding until I reach the doorway, nearly knocking into the frame. It's not the sight that kills me, but the sound. The sound of being too late. Standing in the shadow of its antlers, I can only gasp in horror.

She whimpers under the clamp of its maw, tears and blood running down both temples. I didn't know a moose lacked upper teeth, but from the looks of the bite, it didn't need them. Her limbs twitch, her hands contort, but he watches me. Stares as the crunch seizes all movement.

A life extinguished. A mouth full. A frontal lobe, gone.

I can only scream at the consequences of our curiosity. We didn't know, how could we have? 

It chews, and I hear bone against molar.

It swallows, clearly satisfied.

When it stands, it keeps its eyes on me, but I can't look away. It's taking her up with him, what should be hooves digs with large, hairy knuckles. I watch the fingers disappear inside of her, just above each collar bone. The tear that follows rips her in half like paper. 

As he exits, I watch him take what's left with him.

ShortScaryStories,forest of shadows,"Driving for long trips never really bothered me, but add annoying company, and the whole thing turns into a nightmare.

“How much longer?”

“Lucy...”“What, Kuro?”

“You asked that ten minutes ago.”

“So what? It’s been eight hours, and we’ve only stopped once today.”

“We left the gas station an hour ago. If you wanted to be out of the car longer, you could’ve just told me.”

“It’s not that. I just want to get there already.”

“Yeah, but *you* wanted the scenic route, so you chose this.”

“That doesn’t mean it has to take this long.”

“Just... be quiet, okay?”

“Fine.”

Beep. Beep. Beep.

Wait a second. I just filled the tank an hour ago. Why is the gauge almost empty?

“Hey, Lucy.”

“What now?”

“We need to stop for gas.”

“Didn’t we just fill up?”

“Yeah... Don’t you think that’s weird?”

“Did you break the tank with your terrible driving?”

“My driving’s fine, and you know it.”

“Sure.”

“Can you look up a place nearby? We need to get gas or maybe have the car looked at.”

“Okay... The roads are pretty empty for a popular route. And it's still early...”

“Yeah. It’s weird. It feels wrong, like this should be a busy road.”

“Now that you mention it, it is eerily quiet.”

“Did you find a place to stop?”

“Yeah, I’ll plug it into the GPS.”

“Double Walker Way?”

“It’s a small town. Looks old-timey... kinda like a mini-city.”

“Does it have any hotels? Or somewhere we can stay if the car’s messed up?”

“Yeah, some lodging... a small motel.”

“Perfect.”

Another stop. Great. All I want is to relax for a week with Lucy. She might be the most annoying person in the world, but she’s also the one I love the most. I’ve been waiting months for this, ever since the business picked up in January.

“We’ll be there in five minutes, Lucy.”

“Okay.”

“Doesn’t this place look... dark?”

Lucy looks up from her phone, squinting at the surroundings.

“Woah.”

""What?”

“It’s like it’s almost night-time.”

“Yeah, you’re right. What’s going on?”

“Kuro—”

“What?”

“What's that?”

Suddenly, a figure appears in front of the car—me.“Whoa.”

I slam on the brakes. The car skids, the tires screeching as I steer it into the trees. The road is narrow, a hidden river of dirt winding between the trees.

“Lucy, are you alright?”

“Yeah, I’m fine.”

I step out of the car, and that’s when I see him.

“Lucy, get out here!”

“What is it?”

Lucy struggles to open the crumpled door. When it finally gives, her eyes widen as she sees him. Two of me. Both in the same clothes. But one of them looks... different. Worn. Rugged.

Before we can even process it, the other me speaks.

“Listen—quick, run north. Make it to the town before—”Before he can finish, his body is torn apart. His head flies off. I freeze.“What—what the hell?”

The world suddenly feels... wrong. But this is real.

“Lucy, *run*.”

“Yeah, okay.”

What is happening? Who was that? Why did he look like me? And why did he just die in front of me?

“Kuro—my leg...”

I glance down at Lucy’s leg. Blood is seeping out, probably from the crash. Behind us, I can feel something... *watching*. A shadow, moving with unnatural speed.

“Something’s chasing us. I don’t know what it is, but it’s not fast. Let’s get as far as we can, then rest. I’ll help you with your leg.”

“Yeah... okay.”

“Be strong. You got this.”

Lucy smiles. She knows when I say that, I mean it. But even as I say it, doubts flood my mind. The road we were on should’ve led us to the town, but now... I don’t know.

“Lucy, we’ve been running for a while. I haven’t seen any shadow things.”

“Me neither. But we’re still moving. We need to stop, my leg is killing me.”

“Yeah, we should rest.”

“Are you sure? You’re telling me you saw something chasing us?”

“I’m not sure anything I’ve seen today was real. It’s all... wrong.”

We find a spot to rest, but my mind races. Is any of this real? The other me... I’m covered in his blood. And what was that thing that killed him?

Suddenly, I hear something. A crack.

“Ouch.”

I touch the tree behind me and feel something sharp. Scratches. As if someone—or something—had been there before me.

Footsteps.

*Someone else is in the forest.*

I look around and spot something written on the bark.“Shadows.”

The word is scratched out. I step back, heart pounding.

The shadows... I saw one earlier. But this? What does it mean?

I take my phone out, checking the GPS. But it’s all wrong. It’s already 1:00 a.m.? It *should’ve* been only 10 when we crashed. We’ve been running for hours... but it feels like no time at all. What’s going on?

Suddenly, a screech pierces the air.

“Something’s here. We need to move, now!”

“Lucy, get up!”

“Ugh... okay...”

I hear it again. That screech. But there’s nothing around us.“Did you see anything?”

“No, but I don’t want to stick around to find out.”

“Kuro?”

“Yeah, Lucy.”

“Why do you think the other you said to go north?”

“Why?”

“I don’t know... but the road was going east. I thought the town was that way, but it’s... north.”

“You might be right.”

The sun is starting to rise.

“Wait... you’re right. It was 1:00 a.m. just a few minutes ago. How long have we been running?”

“Not even five minutes.”

“Then why... why is it light out?”

I don’t know. But I’m sure of one thing: something’s wrong.

*Slice.*

Thump.

“AHH!”

“Lucy—your arm!”

I look down, and she’s gone. Her head... it just—*disappeared*. I can’t—

“I’ll be back, okay? Stay here, I’ll get help.”

But I can’t move. My legs won’t carry me anymore. My mind can’t handle it. I feel like I’m falling apart, physically and mentally.

Suddenly, a car.

A real car. I see it—real headlights, a real vehicle. My heart skips. This is it. Help is here.

“Help! Please!”

The car screeches to a halt, and two strangers step out. Their faces are blurred, distant, like something I should recognize but can’t quite grasp.

One of them walks toward me—tall, scruffy, with a weary look in his eyes. His gaze... it’s unsettling, like he’s seen too much. But his face, the more I look, the more it seems familiar.

“Are you alright?” he asks, his voice sounding distant, like it’s coming from a dream. “I’m fine...” I answer, but I’m staring at him, trying to place his features. My mind is foggy. Why does he look like me? Why do I feel like I’ve seen him before?

His companion, a girl with long, messy hair, leans against the car. Her eyes meet mine—those eyes. I can’t forget them. Lucy.

“Where’s... Lucy?” I finally force myself to ask, my voice breaking. My stomach twists.

The girl doesn’t answer. She just looks at me, like she’s waiting for something, something unspoken.

“Where is she?” I repeat, more urgently this time. My heart races.

But then, a realization hits me, like a punch to the gut.

The man. The girl. *They’re us.*

Earlier in the day, I’d seen myself in that forest, talking to me—the me that I thought was dead. They *are* us. The real versions, from before all of this started. But... how?

I feel dizzy, my legs shaking as the realization sets in. The time distortions, the shadows, the other versions of us—*we’ve been here before*. This is the loop. The town. The crash. Everything.

What's real?

ShortScaryStories,Fifty-Nine,"How could I be so *stupid*? I was *never* this sloppy - never ever! I'd gotten too cocky.

I wasn't scared looking down the barrel of the .357, I was fucking pissed.

The man looking down on me grinned delightfully, ""What were you planning to do with this, bub?"" he kicked the butcher’s knife and motioned his revolver toward it. I know - it is very cliche - serial killer with a butcher’s knife; what am I, fucking Michael Meyers? You might roll your eyes, but goddam you don't know how satisfying it is to use that thing.

""Who's the killer now motherfucker?"" He looked absolutely pleased with himself, ""We do it different here in Texas, bub. I've taken down bigger pussies than you over the years.""

I was *seething,* I am a fucking *professional.*

Had this guy known I'd been following him for the past month? Probably not.

Did he know I had killed fifty-eight other cop's the past three years? Maybe.

No, I don't have any long-drawn-out story for doing what I do, but I did have the most important reason. I fucking loved it; and not only that, I was *good* at it. I'm due my god damn respect. Do you know how much work this takes? This dumb hick just got lucky, that's all - pure luck.

I smiled widely at him, ""You know what they call me you fucking pi-""

The .357 swung down smacking the side of my face, I heard a crunch of a few molars as blood, along with a few teeth, flew from my lips.

""You shut the fuck up when I'm talking to you! I know who you are - *Cop Killer.* I was hoping you'd show your face around here, bub. I plan on *pulling* the rest of your teeth, you don't deserve any mercy.""

*Fuck*, I needed an opening here.

Twisting my face to look horrified, I pushed out a few tears and looked up at him.

""P-please m-m-mister I p-p-promise I won’t do it no more. P-please God, have mercy on me! You s-seem like a decent man."" At first, his unimpressed expression remained unflinching as he asked, ""Just how many cops have you killed, bub?"", but when he noticed the piss puddle forming around my bent knees, he wavered for just a second.

This was my moment.

His .357 went off over my shoulder as I dove forward for the knife, the ricochet of the round reverberated through the hallway. The revolver swung around back toward me, but it was too late. Clutching the knife, I cut both of that dumb hicks Achilles at the heel and watched them shoot up into his kneecaps. He let out a sharp yelp and fell like a tree onto the floor where I once kneeled. I stood over him and swung the knife down into the nape of his neck.

Looking down I stood there, pleased with my work.

Hissing, I replied to his dead corpse.

ShortScaryStories,The [redacted] [redacted] lab incident ,"The lab was a secret facility, funded off the books, and hidden on the outskirts of the town. It was built to study a peculiar species of local insect—“Stingers,” we called them, a mutant lovechild of a hornet and a scorpion, that glowed in shifting, hypnotic colors. Watching them too long made you feel like opening their enclosures. Freud might’ve called it the “Death Drive”—that bizarre urge to do something fatal just for the hell of it.

The director was insane and brilliant, a ruthless type who claimed to have connections everywhere: Ivy League, FBI, CDC—you name it. He was like Steve Jobs in a lab coat, only creepier and less tethered to reality. The guy had a resume too good to be true, so I made a few calls one late night after a couple of drinks. Not a single credential checked out. This nobody somehow ended up running a multi-million-dollar lab on lies. I told my people to keep it quiet, though. We had enough problems.

Then it all went to hell. I woke up to alarms, screams, and the unmistakable groaning of Stinger-infected humans. One of those idiots had finally lost to their own intrusive thoughts and let the Stingers out. 

The bugs went berserk, stinging anything that moved and turning people into these grinning, hollow husks that charged teeth-first into the slowest members of the team. Security went full combat mode with rifles, barely keeping the infected at bay.

The next day, the director called a “safety drill.” It consisted of us firing blanks at zombie-shaped targets until he decided we’d warmed up enough. Then he told us to switch to live ammo—on the real infected. Some of us balked, but the Class Ones echoed the director’s every word about “needfulness.” 

They loaded up, ready to fire live rounds, and one guy pulled the trigger—only to get another blank. 

A real gunshot echoed from the platform above. Some poor grunt had aimed at the director and fired a live round, hitting him square in the chest. But instead of collapsing, he just grinned, stretching his lips into a horrifying, infected smile. He lunged, tearing into the grunt’s neck.

It clicked in that second. The director had been infected all along, possibly right from the beginning. The Class One personnel stood frozen, probably waiting for instructions while he chewed through his own people. 

I activated the emergency failsafe on my way out, dodging bugs and infected alike as they swarmed the corridors. I heard screams, banging on doors as I left. I told myself no one could’ve been saved.

I made it out, barely, a survivor of a place that “never existed.” Back in my apartment I found a couple of dead stingers tangled in my clothes. I thought about the director, how he’d conned his way to power. Maybe these bugs were the key to the Director’s glamour, this just might be my big break.

ShortScaryStories,Well Sealer,"My name is Lapius, and I used to be a well builder, but later in life, I became a well sealer. How it came to be so is a strange tale indeed.

In an old village named Lamsa, there stood a well that fed many generations of families for centuries. One sunny day, a cursed event happened at that well: a creature crawled out of it. I call it a creature, but for the most part, it was in the shape of a man, except for the fact that its head had no eyes, ears, or nose—just a gaping mouth.

The frightened villagers hid in their houses as the creature began roaming around, seemingly without aim. After a few hours, it stopped moving and stood still in the middle of a yard. Someone gathered enough courage to carry the creature away into the woods.

Something had stirred loose under the land, and the town would no longer find peace. Two more creatures emerged from the well shortly after, then four more after that.

People, who started calling the creatures Makoon (hell demons), declared that in the well an evil portal had opened and that we needed to shut it. So they asked me, the well maker, to unmake it. I gathered stones, dirt, and debris and filled the well as it breathed its last breath.

The nearest water after that was a creek half a day's journey away.

Even before the perturbation had settled, I was visited by the men of the next town, who relayed another tale of monstrosity sprung from their well. I made my way there and sealed theirs.

I could sense that a far deeper and wider calamity was already afoot below us.

Soon, calls were coming from many other towns with the same pleas to close up their monster-riddled wells. The task became more demanding and arduous, so I enlisted the help of those in like trades: wall builders, earth removers, and grave diggers.

We found ourselves always on the move to the next place to seal up the broken holes of the earthly realm. Each time, we traveled farther and wider, as the seeming curse kept spreading without pause.

My crew and I did not talk during our work. Each of us knew the end of the world had come, and all we could do was carry out mankind's last vocation in silence.

On our way to Maturana, we stopped at the top of a hill for some rest and to survey our surroundings. There, to the west, I saw it: a sea—as far as the eye could see—of the hell demons standing shoulder to shoulder like the trees of an impenetrable forest, all completely motionless and lifeless.

We all looked at each other and started walking in separate ways. Some headed for the mountains, I for the shore, each knowing we would never make it there.

Don’t get me wrong, I was enjoying having an affair. Loving it. The sneaking around. The burner phone. There was an element of danger that made me feel alive.



But I’m a jealous woman. I don’t want to keep sharing.



“My wife…” Jeffrey said. Here came the excuses. “You don’t know what she would do to you. If she ever found out. You left your phone at home, right?”



“Yes,” I said, taking off the wig and bulky coat I purchased as a disguise.



“Nobody saw you come here?”



“I used an old fashioned yellow cab. I paid cash. He dropped me off five blocks away. No one could possibly know I am here, okay? I know your wife is crazy, but you sure go to some extreme lengths.” I threw my disguise on the disgusting ground of this pay-by-the-hour motel. I sat on the bed and swear I heard a crunch from the crust of the sheets.



“Better safe than sorry,” he said.



“I just think we could avoid all this if you were honest with her. You don’t even need to confront her. Just have a lawyer serve her the divorce papers.”



“Oh, I wouldn’t divorce my wife.”

It was already a rough political landscape, and the overzealous hunts did not help at all. Between all the noise, a rough picture of the aliens began to reveal itself. We figured out just how to tear them apart. Sure, it wasn't the most accurate, but it got us results. Manipulating statistics was the easiest part.

That was one of the best traps we ever set. I mean, humans could hold it in, but they could not resist themselves.

They would scream and cry, sending waves upon their empathic channels. Blood from their foreheads mixed with tears. They ripped at their bindings, attempting to avoid the inevitable. However, every distressed sinew, every aching fiber, every pained nerve called millions of aliens into the maws of humanity.

 But they couldn’t see what I saw. 

I began noticing things within a few months of Ian living with us. Strange things. Like how Ian’s cry never seemed to reach his eyes. I can’t recall a single tear ever wetting his cheeks. Almost as if it was all for show. And he was *strong*, strong enough to pull out a handful of my hair when I tried to give him a bath, howling all the while. I tried telling Mom and Dad that he was weird, but they chalked it up to jealousy. Their lives now revolved around Ian, with little time left for me.

I finally discovered why late one night.

I awoke at about 3 am. I glanced at Ian’s crib, only to find it empty. I almost cried out for my parents, but the sound of their bedroom door creaking open stopped me. I poked my head around the corner, where I saw it. 

Ian, his head split open like a blooming flower.

He sat atop my father’s chest, his limbs jutting crookedly from his body. His tongue, now a long, wet rope of flesh, reached down my father’s throat. He was *feeding* on them. I crept back to my bed, unsure of what to do.

Until the next evening.

Mom and Dad needed a break. They decided I was old enough to babysit while they went to dinner in town. Once we were alone, I laid Ian in his crib. His little black eyes looked surprised when I laid the pillow over his face. It took a long time for him to stop kicking. When it was done, I called Dad, putting on my best frantic voice as I told him Ian wasn’t breathing. 

Mom and Dad were devastated.

At the funeral, they both held me tight, sobbing that they were sorry. As I hugged them back, I almost pitied them.

They didn’t know what Ian was.

They didn’t know what I was. 

They didn’t know that I’d been starving while Ian gorged.

And they didn’t know that I don’t like to share.",3114,0.98,67,Chemical-Elk-1299,2024-11-11 19:25:58,1gp93wp,3181,High

My eyelids are razorblades,

I’ve tried to search for it,

Pried my eye wide,

Is it hiding from me?

Time moves so slow,

Conscious of every blink,

An eyepatch brings relief,

There’s wriggling in the dark,

Sleep is palliative, 

There’s wriggling in my dreams,

Waking is despair,

When will it disappear?

On the bus others stare,

Whispers and giggles,

My pain, their spectacle,

No one believes me,

“There’s nothing there,”

“I can’t see anything,”

“It’s in your head,”

One morning the unexpected,

For so long I had hoped,

It’s not there anymore,

I am free. Am I free?

I feel it again,

Clawing at my cornea,

Nibbling the nerves,

It never left,

It moved on,

There’s something in my other eye.",16,1.0,0,Drone_7,2024-11-12 23:56:52,1gq68ns,16,High
ShortScaryStories,Base reality as it is,"Something felt wrong about this reality. Base reality, I assumed. I was more in tune with my form, and could assemble new, strange and foreign thoughts. The true geometry of reality unfolded not only in my vision but my mind. It felt liberating, even if only for a moment.

Everything, literally was just concrete for miles. There were plain square buildings with rectangular holes in them leading to pitch darkness. A monstrous square arch made out of concrete was to my right. The ground had nothing but oil stains and streaks of rust throughout it. I felt like I had a thousand cameras watching me. Floating high above me was a lifeless machine. It was made of unpolished metal and shaped like a bean. It had metal blades drooping from it. Its deep sentience was attempting to copy my thoughts. We both knew I wasn’t supposed to be here. I sat there slowly turning my head around. There was no point in praying. There was no god. The sun baked my skin. With what little atmosphere this place had, my back oozed puss as I felt the cancer forming in my body. My right eye had already gone blind, and my fingers melting onto the ground were hard to pull apart. Somehow this mangled and burning chunk of flesh felt like one of the only breaks in this abstract and terrible place. If there was one word to describe the feeling of being here, it was just awful.

There was no way to kill myself, and no way to for my soul to escape. The machine came and placed me in a pitch dark room as they cut me apart. The only way I knew something was happening was when I felt a jolt of pain in what I imagine was my spine. It’s hard to tell what you have left without a body. They placed me into the chemical solution, and turned on the simulation. I was in the bad ending.",2,1.0,0,mr_redsuit,2024-11-13 10:51:02,1gqheiy,2,Medium
ShortScaryStories,"Ignorance is bliss, they say. ","Growing up, Ivy was used to the strange hours her father kept. A self-proclaimed night owl, he’d leave after she went to bed and wouldn’t return until long past dawn. He always came back smelling like iron and bleach, with blood-streaked clothes that he claimed were the result of a messy job at the butcher shop across town. Ivy never questioned him; it was just another part of her father’s life she didn’t understand, like why he never had friends over or why he kept so many locks on the basement door.

But then she started noticing small, disturbing details—things that didn’t quite add up. Sometimes she’d find deep scratches on his hands that looked suspiciously like fingernail marks. Other times, his shoes were caked with dirt, not from the butcher shop, but from somewhere damp and earthy. And he always seemed jumpy, his gaze darting to every shadow, every creak of the floor. Her questions about his work were always met with the same forced smile and a patronizing pat on the head.

One evening, curiosity gnawed at her, and she decided to follow him. Sneaking out of the house, she trailed him through the quiet, deserted streets, keeping to the shadows. He moved with an intensity she’d never seen before, slipping into an old abandoned building at the edge of town. Ivy lingered outside, heart pounding, as she watched him enter a room lit by a single, flickering lightbulb. She waited, hands cold and clammy, as muffled sounds drifted from within—grunts, thuds, and the distinct rasp of metal against flesh.

An hour later, he emerged, his face set in a strange, unreadable expression. Clutched tightly in his hands was a bundle wrapped in thick plastic. Ivy quickly hid as he strode past her, not noticing her in the shadows. Heart racing, she snuck into the room he’d left behind, only to freeze at the sight before her. Scattered across the floor were wallets, ID cards, photographs of strangers—all of them bearing the faces of people she’d never seen, each wallet smeared with fresh blood.

That night, Ivy went home shaken, but silent. She couldn’t face him, couldn’t meet his eyes without seeing those wallets scattered like gruesome trophies. Her mind raced, filled with questions and suspicions that felt too terrifying to confront.

Days turned into weeks, each one more agonizing than the last, her fear simmering beneath her skin. Then, one night, she heard him come home, only this time, his heavy footsteps didn’t trail off to his bedroom. They stopped right outside her door.

She held her breath as he paused there, and she felt his gaze burning through the wood, somehow knowing she’d seen everything. In the silence that stretched between them, she realized that her father, who she’d always seen as her protector, was only waiting—waiting to decide if she would be his next mark or a willing partner in crime.

ShortScaryStories,It Felt Like Watching A Badly Dubbed Movie,"The voices started at work.

Tony leaned over my desk, his lips forming their usual corporate act: “You’ve really been stepping up lately.” His voice, though? “You’re a dead weight. Useless. I hope you get hit by a bus so I don’t have to deal with your shit anymore.”

It didn’t stop. The receptionist smiled brightly, waving as I passed. “Good morning!” her lips said. Her voice crawled out low and raw: “Don’t fucking talk to me. You’re disgusting. I hope your wife cheats on you—she probably already has.”

By lunch, I was shaking, the noise drowning out even my thoughts. 

I left early. I needed to get home, to be with her.

The house smelled like dinner. She stood at the counter, smiling as she turned to me. Her lips formed the only thing I needed: “Hi, baby. I love you.”

But her voice stabbed me, sharp and matter-of-fact: “He just left. You’re such a clueless idiot. You don’t even know the bed you lie in reeks of someone better.”

My body froze, but I managed to whisper, “What did you say?”

She tilted her head. “What’s wrong?” her lips said.

Her voice, low and cutting, slithered into me: “He makes me feel things you never could. Every time you kiss me, I wish it was his mouth. Every time you touch me, I wish it was his hands. You’re a fucking paycheck, nothing more.”

My throat closed up. “Who is he?”

“What are you talking about?” her lips replied.

Her voice laughed: “You won’t do anything. You never do. That’s why I’m fucking him, because he’s everything you’re not.”

I didn’t think. My hand was on the knife before I realized it. The first stab landed in her chest. Her body crumpled, she mouthed for help but her voice kept spilling: “Even this is pathetic. You’re nothing.”

I kept going. Now the kitchen is still.

Her lips are done lying. Her voice is gone. Finally.

But her thoughts from beyond baked into my vision...like subtitles on a movie.

ShortScaryStories,Hunger of a hyrax,"
In the quiet, rocky highlands of the African savannah, there was a whisper of something unnatural—a hyrax, small and unassuming, but cursed with a hunger for blood.

As dusk fell, james, a field researcher, set up his tent near a rugged cliff. He had spent weeks tracking animal behavior in the area, but he had never seen the hyrax that locals whispered about in hushed tones. According to them, this creature was no ordinary rock-dwelling herbivore. It was larger, with dark, intelligent eyes, and a set of tiny, unnaturally sharp teeth.

The first sign of its presence came when james noticed small, red-streaked paw prints outside his tent. He brushed it off, assuming it was just an injured animal passing by. But then he heard it—a low, guttural growl, oddly deep for something so small.

He peered out into the twilight and froze. Perched on a nearby boulder, bathed in the last light of the setting sun, was a hyrax, its fur bristling and eyes gleaming. Its gaze was fixed intently on him, unblinking and unnervingly aware. As he stared, the hyrax tilted its head, and a dark droplet fell from its mouth onto the rock below. Blood.

Before he could react, it lunged at him. James stumbled back, heart pounding, as the creature scrambled up his leg with alarming speed. Its tiny claws dug into his flesh as it hissed, mouth opening wide to reveal jagged vampire needle-sharp teeth, stained red.

Panicked, he tried to shake it off, but the hyrax clung fiercely, sinking its teeth into his wrist. His scream echoed across the cliffside as he felt it gnawing, each bite more ferocious than the last. He felt his strength draining, his vision blurring, as the hyrax continued its savage attack, tearing into his flesh with an insatiable hunger.

Hours later, when the night was silent again, the hyrax sat alone in the moonlight, licking the blood from its tiny paws. It had fed, for now.

When the search party arrived the next morning, they found nothing but james's torn, bloodstained clothes and his empty tent. High above, the hyrax watched from its perch, eyes gleaming with a hunger that would never be sated.",31,0.95,4,Routine_Reply_6404,2024-11-12 15:12:51,1gpvns6,35,High
ShortScaryStories,The Visitor.,"The knock came at 2:17 a.m., sharp and deliberate.

I don’t get visitors. Not at this hour, not in this neighborhood, and not without warning. The air felt heavier than usual, like the walls themselves were holding their breath. I glanced at the machete leaning against the couch, my pocket knife already in hand.

""Alright, here we go,"" I muttered, moving toward the door.

I cracked it open, keeping the chain latched. Nothing. No one. Just the empty hallway lit by that flickering bulb that hadn’t been replaced in years.

“Bad night to mess around,” I said, slamming the door shut.

The knock came again. Louder this time, more insistent.

My heart thudded against my ribs, not out of fear—I don’t do fear—but because something about it felt...wrong.

I unlatched the chain, threw the door open wide, and stepped into the hallway.

Empty.

But then I heard it. Faint at first, like a whisper carried on the wind. A scraping sound, wet and deliberate, like nails dragging over a chalkboard soaked in blood.

It was coming from the far end of the corridor.

That’s when I saw it.

At first, it was just a shadow, something off in the way it moved. Then it stepped—or unfolded—into the flickering light.

Long limbs, too long, bent in ways that didn’t make sense. Its eyes...God, its eyes. Two black voids that locked onto mine and didn’t let go.

“Wrong building,” I called out, gripping the knife tighter.

It tilted its head, like it was amused. Like I’d said something funny. Then it started toward me.

Not fast, not slow—just...deliberate.

I didn’t wait. The knife felt steady in my hand as I lunged, aiming for its throat. The blade hit home, slicing through flesh like butter. But instead of falling, it smiled.

Its neck folded in on itself like crumpled paper, then reformed, good as new.

“Alright,” I hissed, dropping the knife and grabbing the machete.

This time, I didn’t aim. I swung wild, hacking at arms, legs, anything I could reach. Each hit landed with a sickening crunch, but it didn’t flinch. It just kept coming, that smile stretching wider with every swing.

The lights behind me blinked out one by one. The hallway shrank, the only light now spilling from my open apartment door.

It was in front of me before I could take another swing.

“Do you even know why I’m here?” it whispered.

Its voice was wrong—soft and rustling, like dry leaves scraping against concrete. I swung again, screaming this time, desperate to drown it out.

And then...I was back inside my apartment.

The door was closed, the knife and machete on the floor, dripping with something black and viscous. My chest heaved, my heart hammering in my ears.

But it was gone.

At least, I thought it was gone.

Then I heard it.

“You invited me,” it whispered, just behind me.

ShortScaryStories,One More Bloom,"An old greenhouse leans in one corner of the back yard. It's panes cracked, mottled with moss. The wildness it once contained has since escaped, almost consuming it. Across the way, a tired wooden shed stands slumped, paint peeling and window clouded by webs spun in dusty layers. The mice have burrowed an entrance around the back. 

An overgrown lawn gives way to a flower bed encircling the edges, while below lies a half-collapsed decking area, sagging under the weight of its years. Along the left, leading to the shed, a row of stepped planting areas, once brimming with vegetables, now just home to an abandoned birdbath and a spindly pear tree. A narrow path, cracked and winding, divides the garden.

The garden lights, some blue and others pink, each cast their own soft glow which lends the place an otherworldly hue, as if something magical might stir amongst the weeds. But there are no pixies or fairies that lurk in this garden.

As the moonlight dances across the garden there's a rustling in the flower bed. Wally, once a brown haired rabbit with a white stripe on his nose and a floppy left ear, gently hops onto the lawn. Now his translucent form shimmers in the moonlight. He rises a little, lifting his head and sniffing at the tense night air. He is followed by Mini. A tan coloured hamster with a white band of fur around her middle. She approaches the edge of the flower bed wall, as high as a single house brick, and softly tumbles down and rolls towards Wally. The pair have become friends during their time in the garden together.

Slinky the ferret sleuths about in the jungle that spills out of the greenhouse. He enjoys spooking the mice that flit between the shed and the greenhouse. His ghostly body slinking and darting through the various plants and weeds.

A pair of Whippets, Billy and Milly, curled up together on the free-standing hammock set out on the decking. Their love for each other as strong in death as it was in life. They spend the nights snuggling close and lazing around. The only thing they miss is the heat of the sun beating down on them. Tonight, they snuggle particularly tightly with one another.

At the end of the footpath towards the family home, Bruno the short haired German Shepherd stands proudly, occasionally glancing up at the bedroom of his once loved friend, silently lost in memories of 'walkies'. 

The once loved family pets of the years can feel the weight of what's to come. There's a sombre mood in the air. Bruno glances up at the empty bedroom. The members of the household have since moved away or perished of old age. The house abandoned, barely standing in its decrepit and derelict state. Itself now a victim of the relentless forward march of time. 

The spirits stare at the house and remember what once was. They've seen the notices on the doors and remaining windows. Now they can only linger until dawn, waiting for the trembling of the wrecking ball to bury their memory for good. ",44,1.0,2,MoodyMycelium,2024-11-12 10:45:17,1gpp3v2,46,High
ShortScaryStories,Please Hand In Your Group Assignments,"“Please hand in your group assignments!” the teacher yelled in the usual impatient tone. John and Clara looked at me in anticipation. “Don’t worry; I got it in my bag.” I casually took out my backpack and unzipped it. However, when I looked for the burning red cover of the group work booklet, I found nothing but sheets of snow-white exam papers.

“Wait a second…” My hands start digging through the exam papers like a money counter machine. “This can’t be, I can’t be making such an elementary mistake…” I can feel the sweat pouring out of my palm, my fingers becoming numb as the exam papers cut on my fingers, delivering sharp, acute pain. A chill starts crawling on my back, creeping into the back of my brain.

John and Clara's anticipation was quickly replaced with frustration. “You didn’t forget to bring it, did you, Kyle?” John couldn’t hide the irritation in his voice, breathing heavily as he asked. Clara looked at me with a pale, blue face that was a mixture of confusion and disappointment.

“There is no way! I made sure to check everything before I packed up last night! I swear to God!” I refuted out of reflex. “You know how much this means to me! We spent so much time on this, and we all had to get an A on this course to be considered for admission! It just *can’t be…*” I started throwing out the exam papers in my bag, but there were so many. I flipped my backpack and began to shake everything out, but the exam papers… just wouldn’t stop pouring out.

“This is due today Kyle! You know Mr.◼◼◼◼ won’t be accepting late submissions. We need it now, NOW!” John grabbed me by the collar and shoved me to the ground, and yet the temperature of his breath was the only warmth I could feel. Clara hadn’t said a word. She was just sitting there, curled up. 

I remembered that she was always like this when something bad happened, but back then John and I would take turns to comfort her, which neither of us can do at the moment. Come to think of it, the last time she was like this due to being the only one that failed the admission, we threw a party together to make her feel better. I remember I said to her, “How about we do something fun, like for example, climbing Mount Everest?” Wait, we graduated?

I remembered. We've already graduated. We decided to climb the mountain to celebrate graduation. We were almost there and I should be waking up anytime to join them at our destination.

But why wouldn’t my hands stop digging in the exam papers? Why wouldn’t the snow stop outside? Why did it feel so cold? Why was I still looking for the burning red booklet?

ShortScaryStories,"I finally showed her my place, and she seemed very interested...","I opened the door and gave a dramatic bow to Kailey, motioning her inside. She giggled a bit and stepped through, and I slipped in behind her, closing the door softly behind me.

“Well, what do you think of my place?” I asked, a hopeful and excited color to my voice.

She looked around my decently-sized, clean apartment for a bit before nodding approvingly.

“Your place is amazing, Hubert! Why didn’t you bring me over before?” She asked, walking around.

I smiled. Kailey was one of those girls who always talked with that confidence and passion that makes you smile whenever you’re around them. We had been dating for three months now, and I finally invited her to my place. We spent most of our time together at her place, because it was significantly nicer than mine, with her being a year older and already established on her own.

“Well, your place was so much nicer you know? I mean, compared to mine, you live in a mansion.”

With another giggle we sat down together on my bed. I looked deep into her eyes, and she looked back, those perfect, brown eyes glowing softly.

“Wait here for a second.” I whispered, and stood up slowly. I went into the bathroom, leaving her giggling there softly. 

Her expression turned to confusion when I came back out. I had grabbed a face cloth and an opaque bottle.

“Hubert… what are we going to do?” She asked, clearly intrigued.

I smiled widely.

“Oh you’ll see baby.” 

With that, I rolled up the towel and put it near her mouth. She was clearly into it, and she bit in willingly. Then I opened the bottle, and poured it over the face cloth.

Out  came viscous, crimson blood that doused the face cloth. Kailey tried to spit it out, but it stuck in her mouth.

I took a few steps back and waited.

“Hey Kailey, does the name Eric mean anything to you?”

Her eyes opened wide in terror.

“Oh yes, I know all about it."" 

Her body tensed up.

""You cheater.""

Kailey’s body lifted up, shaking slowly. Her terrified screams were drowned out by the bloody and constricting gag, as her eyes went back into her head. Blood erupted from her torn limbs and the whole room grew ice cold. A pale, shifting figure began to appear, staring hungrily at her tortured and disfigured body. 

And then it started feasting.

Chunks of flesh were torn off greedily. Thick, dark blood covered the walls and my bed, accompanied by the wet, and inhumane chewing sounds that enveloped the room.

Soon enough, Kailey was no longer in my room. Her body had been entirely consumed, and was gone into its endless, hungering being.

It turned towards me, and floated over.

I smiled.

It smiled back.

“That’s what happens to cheaters, right Drew?”

He nodded and we bumped fists.

“Are we going to the fair?” my sister, Janice’s, face lit up at the prospect.

“I'm sorry, honey,” Mom frowned, “We can’t go this year.”

“But you said…,” Janice started to protest but Mom cut her off.

“I know what I said, and I’m sorry,” Mom apologized, “But we just can’t afford it.”

“What’s the surprise?” I asked.

My mom turned to me and smiled, “Since we couldn’t go to the fair. I brought the fair to you.”

“What?” that sounded impossible.

“Well, it’s not the real fair,” she clarified.

“What kind of fair is it?” Janice asked.

“Come downstairs and see,” she motioned for us to follow.

Not knowing what to expect, the two of us followed her down the stairs where we found that she had turned the living room into a series of carnival game booths constructed out of cardboard and various items she’d found around the house.

They all looked really lame but I could tell Mom had put a lot of work into them so I didn’t say anything.

Janice, who was four years younger than me was more forgiving of them.

“Are there prizes?” she asked.

“There are,” Mom replied, “They’re over there.” She pointed at the dining table which held several plates worth of cookies and cupcakes that she’d baked along with a few stuffed animals that she’d clearly picked up at the thrift store.

“Are you ready to play?” Mom held up some Monopoly money for us to use to *pay* for the games.

Not wanting to disappoint her, I took the fake money and decided to play along.

“What’s that game?” I asked, pointing to the one that was covered with a sheet.

“That’s a special game,” Mom replied.

“Can I play it?” I asked.

“You can,” she walked over to the table, “But it costs five dollars and requires you to wear one of these blindfolds.” She held up the strip of cloth.

“Okay,” I agreed, handing her the appropriate money.

While Janice busied herself with the ring toss game, Mom put the blindfold on me and escorted me under the sheet.

“Alright,” she said, “This game is very simple. All you have to do is pop a balloon with one of these darts.” When she said the word darts, she lifted my hand and placed three darts in my palm.

“Ready?”

I nodded.

She stood behind me and positioned my body.

“Throw them whenever you’re ready.”

I threw all 3 darts in rapid succession and was happy to hear two of them pop balloons.

“Great job!” Mom declared before removing my blindfold.

When I saw Dad, who was bound and gagged and covered in balloons, with a dart sticking out of his left eye, I almost puked.

“Don’t worry, honey,” Mom said, “This is just your father’s way of repaying us for spending all our fair money on beer.”",1348,0.99,27,k_g_lewis,2024-11-11 10:22:25,1gow3dz,1375,High
ShortScaryStories,The Dread,"A siren pulled my attention away from the trash heap I had been going through. The first call signaled the start of the dread; I still had another hour before it became too dangerous.

I buried myself back into the rubble. The colony needed a new Phillips head screwdriver, and we had been looking for months. It's weird what you don't have lying around anymore when the world ends, tools became extremely important - go figure!

The bounty for this damn screwdriver was extra rations for a month and my family needed it *badly*.

A whistle came from behind me and a thin voice wavered, ""Hey boss, what're you looking for? I bet I have it back over here."" Turning around I saw some crates near the back edge of the garage the voice had come from. The dread gave me the chills, but it was never that clever.

""Yeah, sure buddy, I'm *definitely* falling for that one."" The dread had no reply to my snarky remark.

See - the trick is not to fall for dread's lame attempts to lure you in when it first comes around; it was later when you actually had to be more cautious.

Another blare of the siren came from in the distance. I stood up and made my way out the garage door; looking up I saw that it certainly was getting dark in a hurry.

*What the fuck?* I thought to myself, I had at *least* another hour! The dread must be coming in quickly tonight.

A baby cried out to my left. Startled, I jerked my head around and saw a stroller rolling down the alley, with no one pushing it.

*Nice try.*

This is where the dread really started to pick up steam, it plays on your heart strings, toying with your emotions to trick you.

I really ought to make my way back, if I ran, I think I could make it to the front gates before it got too dark.

I ran the opposite way down the alley, then up 3rd Avenue where our colony was holed up at the old Pikes Place market. Rounding the block, I spotted Kojack scampering from the front of the Market. How the hell did he get out? Although extremely needy, I had grown quite fond of the pesky mutt we had rescued on our last supply run.

The third and final siren blasted out, frightening Kojack. Haunches raised he ran across the street, pushing nose first into an adjacent store front.

*God dammit.*

I couldn't leave Kojack behind. If I hurried, we could still make it.

Running through the open storefront door, my boot caught on the bent door frame. I fell face first into the store. Feeling stupid, I quickly got up onto my knees and looked up for Kojack.

The dread stood there above me holding a Phillips screwdriver like a dagger ready to strike - ready to plow down right into my dumbfound face.

The library where I worked was nothing special – just another brick building with worn carpet and that distinct smell of aging paper and wood polish. Rain drummed against the high windows, creating shadows that danced across the empty reading room. Ten minutes until closing, and I was already dreaming of my couch and the leftovers waiting in my fridge.

The book return slot clattered. Unusual for this time of night, but not unheard of. Probably someone desperate to avoid late fees.

I walked over and reached into the return bin. A single book lay inside, its cover worn and spine cracked from use. ""The Language of Flowers"" by Sarah Mitchell. I flipped it open to scan it back in, and a pressed flower fell from between its pages – a purple hyacinth.

Strange choice for a bookmark. The flower was fresh, its petals still soft. I noticed writing on the checkout card still tucked in the back of the book. The same name appeared over and over:

Emily Chen.
Emily Chen.
Emily Chen.

Each entry exactly three weeks apart, as if she'd been checking out the same book repeatedly. I remembered her – quiet, always wore oversized sweaters even in summer, kept to herself in the botanical section. She hadn't been in for a while.

Something made me check the system. Emily had renewed this book eight times in the past six months. My cursor hovered over her address: 156 Maple Grove Lane. Just around the corner.

I noticed a note added to her account: ""Patron requested home delivery service due to mobility issues - Denied (not eligible).""

Emily was twenty-three. I'd seen her walk here plenty of times.

The purple hyacinth lay on my desk, and something nagged at my memory. I pulled up a flower meaning website. The page loaded slowly, the fluorescent lights humming overhead.

Purple hyacinth: ""Please forgive me"" or ""I'm sorry.""

Thunder cracked outside. The lights flickered once, twice. In that strobe-like effect, I saw more pressed flowers falling from the book's pages. All purple hyacinths. All fresh.

A newspaper clipping fluttered to the desk. It was folded to show only the classifieds section, with one ad circled in shaky red ink:

""Found: Peace at last. Remember me with flowers.""

My hands trembled as I called the non-emergency police line. The dispatcher's voice was steady as I explained about Emily, the book, the flowers. They said they'd send someone to check on her.

I looked up her last check-out date.

Today.
3:42 PM.
Due in three weeks.

The police called back fifteen minutes later. They'd found her apartment door unlocked, windows open to the rain. On her kitchen table sat a vase full of fresh purple hyacinths and an empty bottle of sleeping pills.

The officer asked if I knew why she'd chosen that particular book to return. I looked down at ""The Language of Flowers,"" its pages still sprinkled with purple petals.

She'd known exactly what she was saying.
She'd been saying it for months.
And none of us had been fluent enough to hear her.",203,1.0,9,choke76w,2024-11-11 17:18:01,1gp6clp,212,High
ShortScaryStories,Overeaters Anonymous,"As I stand outside of the Overeaters Anonymous meeting, listening to my girlfriend share her “success story” on the other side of the door, I turn to the fat man standing next to me. He’s smoking a cigarette.

“I feel like puking my fucking guts out,” I say. “Losing 100 pounds makes her a better person? She’s certainly a hell of a lot less sexy than she used to be.”

The smoker looks like he wants me to disappear.

I continue. “I told her that when she was losing the weight. She said I wasn’t being supportive. Fuck being supportive – I’m a man, and men have needs.”

This gets him to acknowledge me. “Hey pal, if she wanted to do it, good for her, right?”

I snort at him and try to appear menacing. The white knight grumbles something about a new face like hers at their meetings being a good source of inspiration for everyone. He smokes a minute longer and then heads back inside.

As the meeting ends, I wait patiently. I watch through the door as countless obese woman walk up to her and undoubtedly praise her. What fools. Finally, the smoker approaches her. He looks concerned and gestures towards where I stand.

They walk together to the door and open it.

“What are you doing here?” she asks me.

“I wish that you’d told me you were coming here.”

“As I’ve said before, what I-“

“Shut up.”

“A charming attempt at winning me back.” She turns to the smoker. “Harold, wasn’t it? Walk me to my car?”

“Sure thing.” He looks at me in disgust, lap dog that he is.

“I can walk my own girlfriend to her car,” I say.

“For the last time. I’m not your girlfriend anymore. Now please step out of our way.”

I do, and I watch them walk into the parking lot. At her car, they stop. They talk for a moment, look back at me, and finally, both get into it.

—

I use my key to slip through her front door five minutes after they do. I can tell they’re already getting busy.

I walk quietly over behind the couch. They’re kissing, and he’s really into it. It’s embarrassing. This beautiful, fat motherfucker probably hasn’t been laid since high school.

My girl can smell me, and she looks up at me. Casanova is too engrossed to notice.

Her mouth moves to his neck, kissing it on the right side. He leans his head back, eyes closed in pleasure.

I bend over the couch, putting my mouth on the other side of his neck.

Our fangs sink into his throat in unison.

He lets out a surprised yelp that melts into a moan of ecstasy. At least they always go out feeling good.

As we feed, I savor the richly marbled taste of the man’s blood, thanking God for the rise of fast food in this nation. Chianti, Bordeaux – nothing can hold a candle to a good old American red.",945,0.99,16,writingisfunbutusuck,2024-11-11 07:07:27,1gorrgt,961,High
ShortScaryStories,No Way Through Door,"Reality seems repetitive, in a way. 

Like it can twist and contort on itself, to a point of infinite density, or infinite... oblivion. Emptiness. And this idea always terrified me, rotted at the back of my mind, feeble yet corrosive. I would scan the dark for eyes scanning back at me, notice shapes and faces hidden behind shelves and chairs, and my child mind would deform this into an amalgamation of terror it could imagine; a pile of clothes realised as a looming figure and a streetlamp outside would stare back at me like an eye, a menacing light in the silenced blackness of the night.

And my mind took a toll on me. For paranoia through sleepless nights, barricaded windows and drowned out hallucinations, there was something that brought me infinite dread as the concept dawned on me, growing in palpability as I too grew from a child to an adult. 

Think of a space seeping into a new space, a transition from one state to a next.

Doors are the portal through reality, the passway from one lucidity to another. Slightly ajar, and you can still see you traversed environment comfortingly behind you. But shut, lock the door, and the new space becomes alien in comparison. 

And what happens to the space behind the door? Of course, it's common sense, it remains just how it was left, simply existing behind, obviously. And this would have cured my paranoia and unnerve, this simply logic, if I hadn't discovered that something can, in a near incomprehensible chance, go terribly, terribly wrong.",4,1.0,0,NKORE_S,2024-11-12 13:38:41,1gptd7g,4,Medium
ShortScaryStories,I'm a Porch Pirate,"I've been stealing for about 4 months now.

It's not because I'm in desperate need of money. I have a steady job. I only go out of my way to do this for a few extra bucks.

My method was simple: steal any package on any person's doorstep, hold it for a few days, and then sell it. It didn't matter if the contents were expensive; it only mattered if I could make money.

Today I was tipped about a package at the Bautisas' house. I've heard rumors about the couple who lived there, weird people who only left their house at night. I didn't believe or care about the rumors, I only cared about getting my loot.

I quickly drove to their house and saw a black box on the porch. I swiped it and fled to my vehicle; the sound of glass rocking back and forth caught my attention. It was probably something fragile.

Upon returning home, I placed the package on the dining table and excitedly opened it. Inside held 4 large bottles of red liquid. Jackpot. This had to be my best score yet.

In celebration of this, I called one of my buds Chad, and invited him over for a fun night of drinking and showcasing what I snatched up. At first, Chad was impressed. He asked where I got it from and when I told him his expression changed.

""You...*do* know there's rumors about that couple...right?"" he asked, looking at me nervously

I rolled my eyes at this. There was no way Chad was also one of those people afraid of the Bautisas. I expected better for someone like him.

""Chad. For the love of god, those are *rumors*, you don't know if what the shit people are saying about them is true or not,"" I said, ""I mean come on, it's not like this shit is poisonous, it's just red wine."" 

After a few minutes of arguing, Chad eventually caved in much to my liking. We spent the rest of the evening drinking until we got flat-out drunk, while also watching the greatest of trash TV, just having a good ass time. 

I didn't realize I had fallen asleep until I awoke to the sound of vomiting and choking. My eyes landed upon Chad who lay on my couch, convulsing and choking. His eyes rolled up as they bulged and became bloodshot.

I rushed to help him, but someone grabbed my arm. Their grip felt ice cold as it tightened. I turned around and stared at a large pale man with jet-black hair and a plaid suit. His eyes glowed red as he cocked his head.

""So, *you're* that porch pirate we've heard about lately."" he spoke, ""I must admit, I didn't know that this type of blood could harm humans this badly, but that doesn't matter now."" 

""Even though you drank most of what we ordered, I believe you will be a perfect substitution for what we lost"".",186,0.98,3,DottedWriter,2024-11-11 13:49:25,1gp19tj,189,High
ShortScaryStories,Grab A Granny Night at the Vampire Discotheque,"Let me tell you an unknown truth: Vampires are the greatest disco dancers ever.

Some of us, of course, have danced through the ages: the waltz, the Jitterbug, and so forth. However Disco is the pinnacle of human achievement. The Bee Gees, Ottoman, Boney M, The Trammps and not forgetting our much missed colleague, Michael Jackson.

When I entered the club that night, hundreds were grooving to ‘Born to be Alive.’ They all looked stylish in their bell bottoms and peasant blouses. The air was filled with the crimson smoke of blood cigarettes.

“You’re late!”

Shannon, my best friend these past hundred years, berated me before hugging me tightly.

“I'm sorry,” I said, adjusting my midi skirt after being released. “My coffin was too cosy. I had a bit of a lie in.”

Shannon tutted and pointed towards the dancefloor.

“Plenty of hot young guys here tonight,” she teased.

I sighed. “They won't fancy an old girl like me.”

Shannon laughed. “They're men - they’ll fuck anything.”

“Thanks!” I said. “That makes me feel so much better!”

My friend waved my complaint away.

“You bring experience to the table. All three hundred years of it.”

Grabbing my hand, she pulled me to the bar. ‘Jump to the Beat’ was just starting up and the dancefloor was full of guys and girls flying and leaping about.

At the bar, a new batch of *barrels* were being hooked up. I fancied the look of the twelve year old girl so I ordered two glasses. Young blood is so much nicer. Fruitier.

“See anyone you fancy?” Shannon probed. “I mean when was the last time you got laid?”

I shrugged, sipping my ichor. I knew of course. Fifteen years ago. Before my husband committed sunlight suicide.

“I'm not really looking.”

“Well I am,” Shannon scoffed. “I’m getting screwed tonight. You should too - get rid of those cobwebs between your legs.”

I prodded Shannon playfully. “You are so disgusting!”

She took my hand again and this time dragged me onto the dance floor. The disco ball glittered kaleidoscopically, the colours moving to a circular rhythm. The DJ, Grandmaster PlasterBlaster, spotted me and put on ‘Moskau’ by Dschinghis Khan. It was my favourite; it reminded me of home.

As the crowd was boogying, a guy sidled up to me. He was stuck in his twenties - and recently. He smiled. Not bad looking either. When the music stopped he asked if he could buy me a drink. Shannon winked me a ‘go for it’ kind of wink.

At the bar, I asked for another glass of twelve year old. He reached into his wallet. A prophylactic fell out.

“Sorry.”

“You know vampires can't get pregnant,” I teased.

“It's not that,” he apologised. “I overheard talk of a new blood disease. I think it could really hurt us.’

“Okay….” I replied unbelievingly.

I’m glad we played safe that night all the same. AIDS eventually ended up wiping out sixty percent of the vampire population.

ShortScaryStories,Rot.,"I heard it outside my door. It got closer each night. Despite being unable to make out what it was saying, I could hear its despair. Its weeping kept me up. Tonight was different. It had finally reached my door, and finally opened it. I was relieved in a way, I could finally put a face to what used to be unidentified misery. I braced myself. I wasnt prepared, nothing could prepare me. You could have told me what to expect, I could have seen it thousands of times over yet I would never be ready. I wasnt, I never will be. Before I even laid my eyes on it I was hit with a putrid scent. Rot. This thing was decaying. I could hear it clearly now, its desperate gasps for air throughout each round of crying made me shudder, its breathing was laboured and raspy. Every unfulfilled breath sounded like popping and gurgling. 

Even its movement sounded unbearable, a slow dragging of feet, followed by a thud. It was pushing itself off the walls, its legs too decayed to withstand its weight. And then it stopped. It was in my room, no it was closer then that. It was in my face. Despite my vision being obstructed due to my eyes that were forced shut, I could feel its hateful glare pierce through my withering soul. I pushed through, fighting off every instinct and fear trying to revoke my vision, I opened my eyes.

This thing was still weeping, silently now. It's face wasnt filled with tears, instead being swapped with bloody writhing maggots. Its barely attached jaw and punctured lungs were the main causes of its struggled breathing. 

The worst part was the lacerations inflicted on my soul. Despite having only looked at it for a few seconds it was enough to put me into a spiraling pit of mental agony. In that moment I had felt a fraction of this things experience. My eyes started to tear up, something felt wrong. I knew it had to be tears, but as the drops fell on my hand the pure dread hit me as I realised that I was crying blood. My soul, like its, was decaying. My body's purpose was torn apart, dimished to a worthless husk. Through a mix of dread and pain my breathing became pointless, my oxygen depravity was unable to be replenished. 

I'm decaying at a faster rate. My increasingly loose and rotten flesh gets stuck on everything I touch. Even shifting my weight feels like endless suffering. My minds instincts are dragging me along, I need to find someone, not to help me, but to kill me. I think I've found the person. He will bring relief to my soul, I just need to find a way to get into his room.

ShortScaryStories,A Shower,"I come home from a long day of work. I smile at the beautiful sight of my wife and daughter and greet them. It’s been a tiring day, but I’m glad to have come home to my family… and a tasty-looking dinner. I go to my bedroom gather fresh, clean clothes, and stack them on the bathroom counter. I close the door, trying to lock it. The door finally locks, I definitely need a new door knob. I turn the hot temperature switch in the shower and then proceed to undress. 



I step in, sighing in relief that the day was over. The water sprays on my head, flowing down to my chest, arms, legs, and feet. The sound of the shower is oddly comforting, almost like a small waterfall. Thinking that, my mind spaces off visioning a big waterfall in front of me. It’s very beautiful if only it were real though.



I could stand in the shower all day, even if I’m clean; I enjoy the warmth and comfort of the water. I blink coming back to reality then proceed to scrub my head with a scentful drop of shampoo. Cleaning my hair, I slightly hear things. I can’t make out the sound, but I brush it off as it seems like nothing to stick my mind on. I know my mind likes to fake sounds sometimes; so it’s nothing at all.



I rinse the shampoo out, next applying conditioner. I can’t help but focus on that sound again… that sound. I stop for a minute, trying to focus on whatever I’m hearing through the loud crackles of the shower. I hear voices; followed by thumps. It sounds too real.



I peek my head out of the shower curtains to confirm what I’m hearing. No… this isn’t happening. I rush and slip out of the shower, slipping to get out. The door… its not opening! I’m trying to open the door but the knob is too broken. As I’m trying to get out, I hear my wife scream at someone.



I’m panicking to get this door to open. I yell out to her. She screams out my name for help but to no avail. I sob as I’m trying my hardest to get through this damn door. Her screams stop, and I let go of the door, breaking down in pain from what occurred. 



All I hear now is the sounds of the shower pouring and my weeps of guilt and devastation. As I lay crying, I hear the sound of footsteps arrive to my door.",32,0.9,0,ashadowsilhouette,2024-11-11 20:02:31,1gp9ugw,32,High
ShortScaryStories,What does your shadow do while you’re sleeping?," My days are spent with others unworthy;
Gluttonous, prideful, selfish,
The only kindness was a curtsy

I keep my head up showing nothing but kindness,
Still they whisper behind the heads of those that have helped them, 
they think I am uncured of blindness

I sleep troubled in the night, 
I have no words to speak, all I do is think,
My shadow is the only part of me left to fight

I hold her back with the hands that raised me,
I begged and pleaded, please don’t cause chaos,
Her scowl was more abysmal than the Black Sea

My hand loses it’s grip for what I claim was fear, 
Her eyes implied what anger she’d take out on me if I hadn’t, that’s what I tell myself and anyone who lends an ear

I didn’t close my eyes, no, I didn’t even scream,
I followed her to those who wronged me, fear echoed that room, she said we were a team

The blood is not what I feared, but the blame,
Someone finding out this had occurred at my hand, what would happen to my name

I wake in my bed, thanking god for it being a dream, 
I lie there waiting for my breath, only to see on my hands that my ire had in truth, entered her bloodstream

I look around regaining panic, 
Looking for an excuse I call out to my shadow,
I couldn’t find her, she was never there, it was only my heart that was satanic",2,0.62,0,Starfire0826,2024-11-12 10:19:21,1gpoh4f,2,Medium

Each movement was a sharp, agonizing screech of stinging torment. Cold sweat dribbles down her back.

A coppery, metallic taste fills her mouth and invades her nostrils.

Ugly, disorienting, callous lightheadedness fills her head as she arthritically struggles to move. The bones stiffly scrape against each other. Her mind spun and hovered over her body, making her gag and sputter.

The cold stone of the cave sits hard underneath her body.

Tears fall as splinters pierce through her skin and flowers. Her mouth hangs open, her eyes wide, and her eyebrows furl in anguish. Her body shivers and goose pimples emerge from what little skin she has left.

ShortScaryStories,My Friend Broke New Ground And I'm Terrified ,"Every night at 9 p.m., Liam's channel draws hundreds of viewers eager to see a new looped video, his custom AI model weaving breathtaking, nightmarish alien vistas.

When I visited him yesterday, his apartment was in a dismal state.

He was leaning into his monitor, staring. Half-empty soda cans complimenting the stench of weeks-old takeout around his desk. His tripod, once stationed proudly in the corner, was missing—likely sold. I mourned the days when his passion was filmmaking. He had no other interests now.

His monitor displayed one of his generations.

“Not streaming tonight?”

“Azok is generating,” His eyes fixed on the screen. “Look! Incredible. It lets me see.”

The name forced a stifled retch from me.

I avoided looking at the screen. The clips had a way of prying at something within me, like watching surreal horror movies far too young—confusing, disorienting, *terrifying*. 

I looked. God help me, I looked.

The static, soundless scene displayed a cyclopean hellscape beneath a blackened sky that reflected like oil on water. In the distance, an angular figure caught my attention.

“Closer,” He zoomed in, I struggled to pace my breathing. 

Feathery, mismatched limbs spasmed between lurching on two legs and crawling on four. It stopped at a mound, pink and luminescent, and plunged its...claws... into it, ripping out something writhing. Its tongue stripped layers off. My mind recoiled in self-preservation, refusing to process the size and shape of the dripping morsel.

“Jesus fuck, Liam, what are we looking at?!” I bolted for the door and slammed it behind me.

---

The next morning, his phone went unanswered. 

9 p.m. heralded dead air.

Worried, I reluctantly returned. His door was ajar, the lights were fried. The monitor was a lone beacon in the pitch darkness, barely revealing his tripod knocked over in the center of the floor.

The tripod...

A soda-covered phone was plugged into the computer. On the screen, the file explorer displayed a single video file: *alpha-centauri.mp4*. 

The source directory was the phone.

The mouse was also sticky with old soda as I clicked the file. He had just been here. The video began, silent.

Yesterday's hellscape again. This time, the horizon folded in kaleidoscopic waves. Liam stood center frame, gesturing wildly, tears streaming down his face as he pleaded.

The perspective then craned upward, its movement uncanny. No longer static as it had always been before, the realization struck me like a freight train. It can't be...

Liam's mouth formed a name I didn’t want to recognize, cosmic and ancient. 

The camera closed in on him with familiar lurches that made me convulse violently. The perspective loomed—a colossal, angular shadow engulfing him as he shrank within the frame.

His face collapsed into something beyond fear, beyond regret. His lips parted and closed rapidly as he rambled about a bargain, and his rights...No.

 *Rites.*

""*It lets me see.*""

The video looped, light caught my hand on the mouse. It wasn't soda.

ShortScaryStories,This is my hell,"My existence could be compared to that of a hamster: a man stuck in a small cage, ambitiously pushing and striving for a bigger, better life outside his enclosure. All the while, he’s too stupid to realize he’s stuck on a wheel going nowhere – unable to go anywhere, in fact – and hand-fed just enough to survive, but never enough to feel content. It seemed every other hamster around me had figured a way out, so I pushed harder. And as I pushed, I aged, my memories of a younger, happier self fading, until I couldn’t tell if they had ever existed in the first place.       

I assumed I was destined to suffer – until I realized:

This was my hell.

It was the only plausible answer. I must have died without realizing it and been thrust into an infinite punishment of struggle and mediocrity.

After this revelation, I couldn’t unsee the signs: my wife giving me the cold shoulder when her warmth was what I needed most; a medical bill pulling me back into a sea of debt just as refuge came into view; once close friends reduced to yearly birthday texts and the occasional unfunny meme sent at two in the morning; my children flaunting their defiance as if my words and authority meant nothing. And the most telling sign of all – the ever-elusive words of acknowledgement.

This was my hell.

For weeks, I searched for a way to break free from Satan’s grasp, but it was futile. After all, what kind of hell would it be if it offered the answer to your own salvation.

But then a thought struck me.

*Hell can’t exist if I destroy its means of torture.*

Culling the little ones was… difficult. Not because I perceived them as my own flesh and blood, but because in their final moments, they exuded the innocence and repentance I had longed for. But it didn’t matter. I saw it for what it was – a ruse, a fake-me-out, a last-ditch effort from the devil to keep me trapped here, suffering for a reality that could never exist.

My wife, though – I found her hiding in our closet, communing with the devil himself, warning him of my master plan.

“I’m sorry, for whatever I did! We can fix this! I’m your wife! PLEASE LISTEN!”

I pulled the trigger, painting our musty linens and cheap, off brand clothing with her corruption. But not soon enough, it would seem.

“Come out with your hands up!”

Her call for backup had been answered. Satan’s soldiers surrounded me, their red and blue lights flooding through my windows, showcasing my offensive contempt, and proving that, yes – I had found my path to salvation.

Nicholas didn't *understand* that I could sense his gritted teeth as he struggled to pick a lock with a toothpick, his toothpaste breath, cherry flavoured lips, courtesy of him making out with fellow Scooby gang member, Fallon, five minutes earlier. This guy was a mess, and unfortunately, he was *my* mess.

*”Can you be careful?!”* I mentally hissed. 

He rolled his eyes, not the biggest fan of our binding, either. 

*“At least I'm not a cowaaaaard.”* He mentally sang back. 

I sensed the warm glow of his flashlight, his voice a murmur. 

*”JJ, can you help me find the kid?”* 

I held my breath as he strode forward, his fingers wrapped around something warm– JJ’s wrist? When he let out a strangled laugh, it was contagious, and somehow, I felt my own lips curving into a smile. “There she is!” I dropped my pen when he darted forwards. 

*“Call Sheriff Adams!”*

Relaxing, I slumped into my chair. 

Before. 

*Pain.*

It started dull, before exploding down his–my– spine, ripping the breath from his lungs. His scream was agonizing, barely hitting the sound barrier, but through my mouth, it tore me from my seat, something warm and metallic shooting up my throat. Blood. 

I spat it out, but I was already losing him– his thoughts, entangled and muffled and fading, *""Fuck. I didn't…what happened? JJ, what the fuck?”*

*”Did I tell my Mom I…”*

*“I… loved her?”*

*“Did I…”*

Despite his voice fading in and out like ocean waves, I could still *feel* him. 

Falling. 

Plunging into darkness, blood clinging to him, seeping from every orifice. 

I found Nick gutted in a warehouse, laying on his back, his eyes still open. Dead. But he didn't *feel* dead to me. 

His presence was suffocating, drowning me, screaming at me to run, at me to talk to his mom, tell her he loved her– tell Fallon… 

I was barely aware of myself on my knees, a screech clawing through my teeth. 

He was so loud. Afraid. 

Crying.

Grabbing the knife that pierced his stomach, I plunged it into his heart, unravelling the tangled, blackening thread binding us, and severed it, finally cutting us apart. But he was still there. 

*Screaming.* 

Even buried, Nicolas won't leave me alone. 

He's a dead weight attached to me, a body I can't cut away, dragging me down. And as I stand on the edge of my apartment building, fifteen years later, his pained cry in my head, I know exactly how to get rid of my *soulmate*. 

*“Jump,”* he whispers. 

I do.",1175,0.99,17,Trash_Tia,2024-11-10 20:24:36,1goho0w,1192,High
ShortScaryStories,It probably won't ever stop,"Every day I wake up. That's when it starts. I force myself out of bed with the least amount of energy possible; sleep has lost its refreshing effect a long time ago. I wonder where it went. 
My first steps lead to the bathroom, no exceptions. I get ready and dressed only to look at the clock at the usual time; it tells me that there is no room for breakfast. There never is.
Dust swirls up from my uncleaned car seat as I sit down at the same time as yesterday. The steering wheel feels cold, and the cheap leather does not hide a heating function, no matter how hard I wish for it. I never wait to warm up my engine; the key turns the ignition without hesitancy, and the old, creaking vehicle starts moving, cruising along the same streets as always. 
The thoughts normally start at around fifteen minutes into my thirty-minute commute, twenty-five on Fridays; they creep into my brain in a way that I cannot defend myself against. Letting them roam freely, I realize that there isn't much that keeps me from certain death. One wrong turn of the wheel and... 
Would anybody even miss me? 
I always wonder why I never did it before. As long as I didn't crash into someone else, nobody would get hurt, right? Both I and they know how replaceable I would be. I merely am but an ant in this giant hill of reoccurring events that color everything gray. I wouldn't be surprised if even the blood that would eventually come dripping out of my crushed body was equally as gray as the tone that my life slowly turned into. Every returning situation, every empty conversation that I think about, turns my hand a little further to the right. Further and further until my wheels cross the white stripes, signs of another forced structure. 
That's when I catch myself. I'll eventually do it, maybe tomorrow. I'll do it when the gray finally turns dark and swallows the last bit of energy. 
But is that ever going to happen?
I wake up the next day and force myself out of bed with the least amount of energy possible. The sleep I get is never refreshing.",26,0.82,2,Terrible-Island684,2024-11-11 15:52:41,1gp4bpo,28,High
ShortScaryStories,Trenches,"“Mom, when can we visit Great-Grandfather?”

Mom looked surprised. Jennifer had never shown any interest in Great-Grandfather, slowly decaying in a senior’s home, before. “I’m not planning to visit- Why?”

“Can I just go myself? We’re learning about WW1 and Ms Johnson said to ask if our family were involved. Great-Grandfather was in the war, right?”

“Jennifer- you know he can’t talk much now, and even when he could, I don’t remember he enjoyed talking about it.”

“Please mom, it’s for our history grade! And he’ll be pleased to have a visitor!”

Mom reluctantly agreed. Her Grandfather, as far as she remembered, had been a surly old man, not the kind to welcome a bright-eyed child eager to talk about the war. She had childhood memories of him, jerking, trying to grasp her hand. Once he asked her to put her hand on his chest. She had been frightened, and ran away. 

However, Jennifer, the sort of student who had to get good grades, was persistent about visiting, and eventually Mom agreed to take her. 

The smell of cleaning and old bodies in the home together with the background hum of machines and TV was overpowering. Jennifer found his room with bright determination, knocked loudly on the open door and entered. “Hello Great-Grandfather!” she called out. 

Great-Grandfather was sitting on his wheelchair in the half-dark room, his head tilted, drool running. He didn’t answer. Jennifer walked up to him, leaving Mom at the doorway.

“Hello, I’m Jennifer, your daughter Valerie’s granddaughter. I’ve come to talk to you about the Great War. And thank you for your service!” 

Great-Grandfather turned towards her. His droopy mouth twitched. Jennifer felt he was smiling at her. 

“Jennifer?” he mumbled. “I remember you. A baby. Come, I have so many things to tell you about the war- moving pictures in your head!”

Jennifer pulled out her notebook and pencil, and walked closer. “That’s so kind of you Great-Grandfather! May I take notes?”

“Yes child. But how I tell you, it will be like you were there, in the trenches. You won’t need your notebook. Come here.”

Jennifer was thrilled- they had watched video footage of the trenches, and now she could tell class she had talked to someone who had actually been in them. She went so close to him she could smell his piss. “Tell me please.”

He reached out, gripped her hand and placed it on his chest. Jennifer stayed still. 

BOOM! An explosion shook her, she was thrown to the ground- mud and grit flew up in her face. She could hear men shrieking - rat-tat-tat - she was outdoors. Things were falling, flying around her. She knew where she was. 

Back in the nursing home room, Jennifer's soul-less corpse collapsed at the feet of Great-Grandfather’s wheelchair. 

Great-Grandfather smiled, at peace for the first time in almost a century, as his memories faded and Jennifer soul replaced his in the trenches. He reached out and pulled up his blinds. Sunlight streamed in.

ShortScaryStories,Trophies of Flesh and Concrete ,"
There’s a legend in the city of Cancún, México, that goes like this:

It’s said that there’s a group of people on social media, specifically on Telegram. These individuals collect hit-and-runs and usually go out at night to run over homeless people, workers heading home in the early morning, any poor soul that crosses their path, even children.

They go out like hyenas and record everything as evidence of their disturbing fetish. They view them as trophies; the more destroyed the body is, the more reputation they gain. In a place like Cancún, where the law and corruption go hand in hand, impunity spreads like a virus, and these people's madness has no limits.

You should be more careful next time, or you could end up a trophy on the asphalt, and no one would know that it was all premeditated, where the devil set its eyes on you on purpose.",11,0.93,0,AronPolanco,2024-11-11 19:15:54,1gp8w9o,11,High
ShortScaryStories,Three Knocks,"Three knocks echoed off her front door and rang through the house. It woke her from a dead sleep and she glanced at her phone—3 in the morning. She rolled out of bed and stumbled to the door, peering through the peephole.

An old man stood there hunched over, leaning on his cane heavily. He wore a suit and tweed hat with a scarf wrapped tightly around his neck.

She cracked the door open until it caught on the chain.

“Hello?” she said to the old man.

“Sylvia?” he responded.

She shook her head. “There’s no Sylvia here. Do you need help?”

The old man didn’t respond. He turned and slowly walked down the steps and up the sidewalk. She quickly closed and locked the door, then went back to sleep.

The following night, three knocks echoed off the front door at 3 in the morning. She again glanced at her phone and huffed, quickly making her way there. Outside the peephole stood the old man.

She unlocked and pulled the door until it caught on the chain.

“Hello?” she said in a far more annoyed tone.

“Sylvia?” he responded.

“Sir, there’s no Sylvia here. It’s 3AM. You need to stop coming here,” she said scowling.

The old man turned and slowly walked down the steps and up the sidewalk. She tried to crane her neck and see where he was going but he disappeared behind the bushes.

She closed the door and called the police station.

“Willoughby police department,” answered a woman.

“Yes, I didn’t know if I should call or not but there’s this old man that keeps coming to my house and knocking at my door early in the morning,” she said.

“An old man? Did he threaten you or try to force his way inside?” the police woman asked.

“No no, nothing like that. He just knocks and asks for Sylvia, then walks away down the sidewalk,” she responded, her cheeks now flushed. “But it’s 3 in the morning, and it’s the second night in a row.”

The woman typed something on the other end. “Well, we can send a cruiser to take a lap around the block but I would suggest just ignoring him if it happens again. He obviously lives in the neighborhood if he’s walking there, perhaps he’s just confused.”

She sighed into the phone.

The next night, three knocks echoed off her front door. She rolled over and grabbed her phone. 3:00AM brightly flashed in her eyes. She growled and set the phone down, pulling the covers up over her head. Another three knocks sounded at the front door, louder this time. She stayed under the covers and closed her eyes trying to ignore the sound. A handful of seconds passed without any further knocks.

“Thank God,” she whispered to herself.

She started to relax and drift off to sleep.

ShortScaryStories,I stepped on a baby crow,"I stepped outside, just a normal day,  
But something small got in my way.  
A baby crow, fallen from its nest,  
I didn’t see it—the thing of flesh.  

With a crunch beneath my shoe,  
A flutter of wings, a sudden shrill.  
From every corner, they took to the sky,  
Cawing and swirling, oh, how they cried.  

They started to watch, with beady eyes,  
From rooftops high, they seem to rise.  
Every rustle makes my heart race,  
I can’t shake the feeling—I’ve lost my place.  

I tried to run, but they followed close,  
A dark cloud hovering, they see me as foe.  
Each caw echoes, a haunting refrain,  
A reminder of guilt, a weight of pain.  

At night, they gather, a swarm of black,  
I feel their presence, they won’t hold back.  
I wish I could turn back the hands of time,  
But the crows won’t forget my hedious crime.  

Now I walk in shadow, always aware,  
Of the crows that circle, that linger in air.  
In just a moment, I changed my fate,  
And I’m haunted now 

By their relentless hate.",22,0.85,1,vincidelaunc,2024-11-11 13:21:31,1gp0lat,23,High
ShortScaryStories,Mystic Meadows Ln,"There's a dream I have on the regular. 'Mystic Meadows Lane', my old street I lived on when I was 3. The dream is always so warm; it's such a fond memory. I stand in the middle of the street with my old baseball cap. I can feel the breeze on my neck. I can hear the gentle rock of the trees' branches. It was 75°, and sunny. I've always taken this dream as a blessing; an escape from any and all bad thoughts.

That is, until a week ago.

I heard a faint scratching noise in the dream that night. The dream was still just as peaceful and warm, don't misunderstand me, but the scratching? That was new. I looked around for any cause of the noise, until I saw it. A tall grey figure with no jaw.

It had to be over ten feet tall, and skinnier than a stick, but the jaw? I don't get why that was all that mattered in my head. Shockingly enough, this figure wouldn't move. It just watched me from the treeline behind my childhood home.

The next night was no better. The dream was the same, but the figure stood closer now. It was near my house, almost 30 feet closer than the night before. It just kept staring. That wasn't what bothered me though. The temperature had dropped by a whole 10 degrees, and the trees were swaying from the wind. I quickly woke myself up, not wanting to be there any longer.

Each night, it got worse and worse. As the figure reached my front porch, the sky turned red. As it made it to my mailbox, the temperature dropped to 45°. It was hard to enjoy the dream like this. I couldn't take it. Two nights ago, it stood right behind me; it breathed down my neck, and as the trees lost all their leaves, and the pavement cracked more and more from the frigid air, I turned to it, and began to sob. The tears rolled down my face, freezing in the negative temperatures. It just kept staring.

This brings us to last night. I fell asleep in fear, needing to take melatonin just to get my brain to give up fighting the sleep. My dream began, and to my horror, everything had returned to normal. A large scratch mark trailed away from me down the street. Curious, I began to follow it. I walked for hours, down an interstate, through various towns, and finally...

To my home I live in now. I walked inside, continuing to follow the scratch mark, and followed it to my room. There the figure was, but he wasn't watching me. It was watching the real me, in the bed fast asleep. I tried to wake up, but I couldn't. It was making me watch myself sleep.

I fought and fought and fought. I wanted to wake up. Anything to wake up. I watched as the real me slightly turned over in bed. There was no point in trying. I sat down, defeated, as the figure with no jaw continued to stare at the real me. When I finally woke up, he wasn't there, but the scratches were.",13,0.93,0,WTFI5THIS,2024-11-11 13:55:08,1gp1et6,13,High
ShortScaryStories,I Had to Take the Life of a Boy Playing Hide and Seek,"When he opens his eyes, the first thing he notices is how cramped and tight it is.

He can’t remember why he's here, lying in this box, his hands lying tightly at his sides, arms unable to bend.

He blinks into the dark. How did he even get here?

Perhaps—no this had to be it.

Playing hide and seek with mommy and daddy like usual, hiding into that big wooden box in the attic.

He hid himself in so well they couldn’t find him. He must've had a little nap waiting for them.

Any second now, he thinks, they’ll come find him.

A few minutes pass.

It’s a little harder to breathe than before, and it feels like the air is running out. He stretches his legs, but they barely budge, pinned in by the box’s walls.

*Was it always this cramped?*

*Wait*—*had the box always been this soft inside?*

A thickness gathered in his chest and throat.

Alright, he thinks, maybe it’s time to leave his hiding spot.

He pressed his hands to the top of the box, pushing as hard as he could.

It didn’t move.

He tried again, pressing, straining, but there was barely any room to lift his hands.

A strange feeling sinks in, but he won’t let it scare him.

He’ll wait a few more minutes; Mommy or Daddy will come. They’ll laugh and help him out.

Then, the box shifts.

He called out, “Mommy? Daddy?”

But his voice barely rose above a whisper.

I’d never wanted a physical body before, not until now. Usually, nothing gets to me—but the way he cried out? That almost broke me.

Outside the box, he heard it—soft, muffled sounds. Sniffles. Sobs. Quiet, broken cries. Other voices mutter things he can’t quite catch.

He wants to yell, but it’s like his voice is caught in his chest, the air too thin and his body too tired.

The box moves again, being lowered this time until it’s perfectly still. There’s no more sound, no more movement.

His vision dimmed, and the air around him was thinning.

A memory flickered, vague.

He was in Mommy’s arms, his face tucked against her chest. Her voice cracked as she held him, rocking him, “Stay with me, baby, stay with me.”

Daddy’s voice beside her, “It’s going to be alright! We’re on our way to the hospital!”

I wanted to take him away then, to save him from all of this. But I don’t choose the timing—that’s already decided. I cannot go against destiny.

The memory fades away as a new sound reaches him—soft, rhythmic thuds above, like rain falling gently overhead. 

But this isn’t rain. 

It’s heavier. Grainy.

The ceiling of the box starts to press down, just a little.

It was earth.

The last of the air in the coffin runs out.

I took the boy’s soul as gently as I could, cradling him in silence.

ShortScaryStories,I Saw The Wall Made of Stone And Wings,"I can recall the first time it happened, when I was twelve. A man named Arn Henshaw wandered into the Cunningham family's home as if it were his own. Naturally, this alarmed the Cunninghams, who contacted the authorities. Henshaw insisted the house was his, a claim that baffled anyone familiar with Hawthorne. The Cunninghams had lived there for years.

Henshaw told the police he was hiking a trail in Grayson Grove, one he and his late wife often strolled. There, he encountered something he'd never seen before: a stone wall adorned with colorful, flapping wings. At first, he thought they were butterflies, but upon closer inspection, he realized the wings were attached to the wall itself.

Everyone, including my parents, thought he was having a mental episode. After a stint in Taft County Mental Health Hospital, Mr. Henshaw returned to Hawthorne. Despite his unusual introduction to the town, he claimed it felt like home. He eventually settled into a job as a mechanic and married a woman named Trudy.

""I owned a shop a lot like this,"" he told me, recalling the events that led him to Hawthorne. ""That's why this place feels so much like home.""

""Did you know someone had your same name in Bedford?"" I asked, referring to a county about fifty miles away from Hawthorne. I had discovered this while doing research.

""You don't say. What's that Arn Henshaw up to?""

""He died when he was a teenager.""

""Poor fella.""

""Did you ever talk to Maddy Green when she came to town?"" I asked, curiously. Maddy Green stumbled onto the town square about five years ago, screaming about a stone wall and wings, and she was trying to find it again.

""I never got the chance.""

The rest of the story was filled in by dinner tables across Hawthorne, mine included when my partner heard that Maddy Green claimed, like Henshaw, to have wandered the trails of Grayson Grove and come across a wall he had described. 

The authorities said the woman was distraught from losing her husband while he was deployed overseas. Unlike Henshaw, Maddy Green didn't take to Hawthorne, and a month after her arrival, she committed suicide. 

The note she left simply said, ""I did not find him here.""

""Why do you think the wall appeared to you two?"" I asked bluntly.

Henshaw stood silently for a moment, before he said, ""I don't think there ever was a wall, but I can tell you that in my mind back then I felt like it chose me.""

That's why I wandered the trails of Grayson Grove for hours. My heart had ached for months, my dinner table silent. All I had was just the slimmest of chances, but when I finally saw colors in the distance, I rushed over. The deep gray wall, surrounded by hundreds if not thousands of colorful wings all taking turns flapping, and when I saw a small path leading to another trail, I took it.",90,0.97,6,GN0515_,2024-11-10 23:28:40,1gokyb7,96,High
ShortScaryStories,The Last Garden,"It was the hottest summer anyone could remember.

My wife and I had spent months nurturing our backyard garden, the last thriving patch of green in our drought-stricken neighborhood. Every morning, we carefully measured our precious water rations, sharing them between our vegetables and the few flowers we couldn't bear to let die. While other yards turned to dust, ours remained a small oasis.

But that morning, something felt wrong. As we returned from the weekly water distribution center, I noticed our garden gate was slightly ajar. We never left it open – not with water thieves becoming more common every day.

I told my wife to wait by the car, just in case. She clutched our last water jug to her chest and nodded silently. I made my way down the garden path, past the withered remains of our neighbor's yards. Each footstep crunched on dead grass, echoing in the scorched air.

Our garden was in chaos. Someone had trampled through the carefully tended rows. Tomato plants lay crushed, their precious fruit scattered and split. The rain barrel was overturned, its contents soaked into the thirsty earth. Who would do this? Was it simple vandalism, or had someone been desperate enough to destroy what they couldn't steal?

Then I heard it – a soft slurping sound coming from behind the garden shed. The intruder was still here. I picked up a fallen trowel, its handle smooth from months of use. Whatever I was about to face, I needed answers. Our garden wasn't just plants – it was our future, our hope, our survival.

I crept around the shed's corner, each step deliberate and silent. The slurping grew louder. I could see a shadow moving in the space between the shed and the fence. With one deep breath, I stepped forward, ready to confront whoever had violated our sanctuary.

I froze. There, crouched among our prized cucumber vines, was a deer – the first I'd seen since the drought began. It looked up at me with dark, liquid eyes, water dripping from its muzzle. It had somehow found the underground spring we'd been carefully hiding, the real source of our garden's survival.

I called my wife over softly.

""Is that really a deer?"" she whispered.

""Yes,"" I answered, gripping the trowel tighter. ""And it's the last one we'll ever see.""

The deer kept drinking, unaware that in this new world, even mercy had become a luxury we couldn't afford. Its meat would feed us for weeks, and its absence would keep our secret safe. In the end, survival wasn't about what we could save, but what we were willing to sacrifice.",402,0.99,3,choke76w,2024-11-10 14:03:17,1go9gg2,405,High
ShortScaryStories,A Viral Cacophony,"I sit at the kitchen table facing the unlocked front door.  I needed help, and I knew Patrick would come running as always.  Hopefully he’ll listen.  After throwing open the front door he freezes, “I’m sorry Pat. I won’t be able to hear you,” I say, pointing at the bleeding stumps where my ears used to be.

His mouth moves, and the words can’t reach me, but the glint of tears is enough.  My self-inflicted injuries should be the least of his concerns.

“Patrick. I’ve got to warn you,” He heads into my kitchen, and begins searching the cabinets, “Patrick!” I shout into the void, “do you hear it yet?  That inescapable rhythm?”

He returns with a scrap of paper and bandages, “Before you can help me, you need to make sure you won’t hear it eith-.”

He slams a scribbled note down in front of me, “Stay Still/Quiet” 

“Fine, ignore me, but let me at le-” he begins tapping his finger on the paper and I dutifully stop moving.  Of course he wouldn’t care about how I first heard it.  Where I found that insidious song.  As always, he is concerned with the present, washing off and bandaging the useless holes where my ears used to be, instead of thinking ahead, “You always know how to get on my nerves.”

I can’t see him, but I can feel him yank the bandages tight.

“I thought Erik was an improvement, but even he threw a fit when I tried to help him.”  There’s a pause behind me, “don’t Pat,” I turn and try to grab his jacket and miss. He dashes off to the bedroom.  

I don’t hear a scream or a shout.  But the floor rattles as heavy feet stomp behind me.  Pat, leans over me and snatches up the paper, he scribbles something on it, and slams it back down on the table, “WHAT DID YOU DO?”

“He’d started to hear it too.  I only tried to help.” 

He taps on the paper.  A dull ringing fills the severed space where my ears used to be, “it’s already come for you Pat.”  His fingers pound a melody into the table.  I recognize the pattern.  It’s haunted every moment of the last couple weeks.  Earplugs didn’t help.  Neither did catchy tunes or blaring songs.  Even now, despite my mutilation, it’s wriggling between the folds of my brain once more.  A seductive cacophony perfectly in synch with Pat’s tapping.  

“But you’ve only begun to hear it.”  I get out of the chair and face Patrick.  It’s returned; a slinking shadow is whispering in his ears.  My fingers tighten around the knife in my pocket.  I’ll succeed this time; I’ve learned from my attempt on Erik.  I swoon forward and Patrick reaches out to catch me.  When his distraction is at its peak, I deftly bring my knife up.  Its slinking tongue is trying to slither inside his ear canal, but I know how to stop it.

ShortScaryStories,I Didn’t Understand Why Dad Distanced Himself After Mom's Death,"It had only been a week since Mom’s accident, and I was struggling to accept she was really gone. They said her injuries were so severe that viewing her body wasn’t an option. Now, it was just Dad and me, trying to fill the silence in a house that felt haunted by her absence.

But something about Dad felt off. He avoided me, almost like he was afraid of me. He’d drift from room to room, tense and distracted. When I tried to talk about Mom, he’d just turn away, silent and sad.

Then the visions began.

Sometimes, I’d catch glimpses of her, standing in the hallway or hiding in the backyard. Her appearance grew more terrifying each time. Her white dress was soaked in blood, her face pale and bruised, with hollow eyes that seemed to stare through me. One night, she rushed at me, screaming in agony. I was so terrified that I ran straight to Dad, sobbing about seeing her.

Dad’s face paled, and he put his arms around me, trying to calm me down. He called a psychologist, telling them I was struggling with grief. I started therapy, and the hallucinations lessened with each session. But Dad grew quieter, almost distant.

When I finally felt well enough, I wanted to do something for him-a surprise to help him feel better. I thought about decorating the house to lift his spirits. So, I went to the basement, hoping to find old holiday decorations among the boxes.

As I roamed around, I felt something cold and stiff. My heart pounded as I realized what I was touching: a hand, pale and lifeless, hidden beneath old blankets and dust. I recognized her wedding ring, and a sickening dread washed over me.

It was her. Mom’s body.

Suddenly, everything clicked- the visions, Dad’s silence, the fear in his eyes. Shaking, I ran upstairs and confronted him. “Why is Mom’s body in the basement? You lied to me...""

He looked at me, his face a mask of sadness and resignation, “I told everyone she died as you demanded, so you could have a chance at a normal life. But I couldn't hide her in the backyard as you asked... because anybody can find it out, so I hid her in the basement.

ShortScaryStories,Ellie,"Ellie’s mother was killed in a car crash when Ellie was fourteen. They had been on their way to IKEA.

Ellie never went to an IKEA for years after that, as she had no reason to, until she was an adult, setting up her own place, and she simply had to visit one.

And so, on a sunny fall Saturday afternoon, she drove to the local IKEA, and entered, feeling that usual combination of joy, excitement and wonder that accompanies the start of any IKEA visit. She didn’t think much about her mother anymore, what with the passage of time and all that.

The IKEA store was crowded, as expected. Ellie followed the arrows, trying to focus on what she needed and not be distracted by the hundreds of pretty objects artfully placed around the milling human bodies. The bedroom décor was exactly what she would have wanted. She stood wistfully in the fake room, fingering the soft colourful throw on the bed. People moved by her, and the hum of the crowd blanketed her mind.

“You should definitely get that” said a woman pleasantly in her ear.

Ellie turned- irrationally expecting to see her mother, one of those cruel tricks of the heart of those of us who are grieving.  

It wasn’t her mother. Just another woman. Ellie smiled. “It’s gorgeous isn’t it.”

“I love it” said the woman emphatically. “I want to feel it all the time. Forever”

At that moment Ellie realised there was something wrong with the woman- her face- her features not quite where they should be, the pinpoints of fire in her otherwise blank eyes. Slowly, she let go of the throw, and began merging back in the crowd. The woman didn’t notice, too focused on trying to touch the fabric.

Ellie let the crowd sweep her to the kitchen displays. She stepped up to a stove, where a woman was staring at a large, impossibly bright gleaming pot. Ellie looked at the reflection of their faces, curved and deformed, in the pot side. This must be her mother, she looked like the woman in the photos Ellie had at home.

The woman turned to Ellie, her mis-adjusted face full of wanting, her eyes flaming with the desire to have. “You should get this pot- It is so beautiful, and the handles are heat resistant.” She moved her ghostly hands which seemed to have the wrong number of fingers, or fingers positioned wrongly, around the black handles. “Look Ellie- this will last forever. Forever.”

Ellie stifled a sob, and stumbled out of the kitchen.

But, she wasn’t ready to leave yet. She knew, knew with desperate certainty that her mother must be here, admiring something, and she had to find her.

She was in the living room displays. Among the slow humming flow of humans, there were women looking yearningly at couches and coffee tables, standing too still, the positioning of their bodies wrong.

Ellie knew one of them had to be her mother.",251,0.97,19,1000andonenites,2024-11-10 06:25:41,1gnzjlr,270,High
ShortScaryStories,Things are Duplicating in my House,"This whole thing started with something so small, so miniscule. I thought I was going insane when I spotted not one but two sets of keys to my car sitting on the kitchen table. I had a spare, but this had to be the exact same set because the back of the fob had been scratched. Well, that and the fact that I found the spare in my drawer upstairs.

It started slow, a small thing here, a little change there. I'd notice an extra sock that would deviate the number of pairs I had. My wife would ask why we had two candles burning when she knew for a fact that she only bought one. I couldn't let her catch on, she'd freak out and probably claim the place is haunted. Things are going great right now between us and the kids, I won't let some stupid curse or whatever this is take it away.

Yesterday it was extremely hard to cover up the days duplicate. My neighbor's kids were playing catch when the ball landed in our yard. We were very close with them so Tommy, their youngest, didn't even hesitate to run over. I watched him with fear in my eyes as he picked up not one, but two baseballs. Why the worry? Well, his baseball had been signed by a Major League player, and now there was fucking two of them.

I couldn't explain it to my neighbor, how an exact copy with the exact same signature was sitting in my yard supposedly when his kid came to pick it up. He was baffled and thought it was some miracle by God when he went to sell the duplicate for a hefty amount.

Tonight though, I'm restless, this duplication issue is really starting to get on my nerves, it could cause everything that I'm barely holding together to fall apart. I've almost finally drifted off when I hear a clanging crash downstairs, my wife looks at me terrified and she runs to the kids room to call the cops while I investigate. I take my .45 and slowly check the house floor by floor until I reach the basement door.

I slowly walk down and investigate. Nothing, phew. We are safe.

I wait for the cops to arrive and reassure both them and my wife that everything is okay and there were no intruders. She decides to sleep in the kids room and I promise I'll watch downstairs until sunrise just in case anything happens. I tuck in the kids and give her a kiss before heading down the stairs.

I don't stop at the first floor however and continue my descent into the basement. I push the old rotting wood wardrobe to the side and enter the small hidden room that was built into the house back in the 1940's.

There he is, tied up, just as I left him.

He eyes me with malice, and I eye the bucket I gave him as a means of relieving himself knocked over on the floor. Must have been what caused the noise.

I set it back up and give him a sorrowful look.

A man who looks exactly like me, in every way, in every expression.

Some days I question if he is the original or if I am, but that doesn't matter.

I have memories, of an entire life, and I have a family to look after.

I won't let this bastard stop me, and so I can't ever let him escape.",370,1.0,7,DarkLegendsNeverDie,2024-11-10 00:08:51,1gnu7fn,377,High
ShortScaryStories,An Imposter Is Trying To Steal My Life,"I first saw her at my local donut shop. I was enjoying a chocolate donut when I noticed something out of my peripheral vision. I turned and saw...me.

It was like looking into a mirror. She had the same eyes, hair, body, and everything similar to me. She stared at me with an angry scowl. Before I could say anything, she began walking away.

I chalked that encounter as something my tired mind imagined. Clubbing late must have taken a toll on me. That was until I came home later that day to find my bedroom ravaged, and some of my clothes had been stolen.

I reported the break-in to the police, who told me they'd investigate further to find the culprit.

Then I saw her at the grocery store. I quickly stopped at the dairy aisle to pick up a milk carton. As I examined it, a hand suddenly clasped my wrist. ""Hey-!"" I shouted but was immediately shocked to see her again. Not only did she have a smug grin on her face, but she was also wearing one of the clothes stolen from me.

She let go and I quickly pushed my cart along. That grin was still ingrained in my head as I was at checkout.

Two days later, a friend texted me. But what she sent confused me, I read it repeatedly, and I still couldn't understand it.

""I gotta tell you, you went WILD during that party last night! You killed it on the dance floor and everyone loved you!""

I didn't go to any party, at least not recently. 

I asked her to clarify what she was referring to, and she sent me a video. Upon playing it, I immediately recognized the woman on the dancefloor. It was the woman who looked exactly like me and who I saw at the coffee shop and the grocery store.

This wasn't making any sense.

One faithful evening, I returned home and discovered a message painted in what I later learned was pig blood smeared in my living room. ""THIEF"" was what the message read.

As I tried scrubbing the message off, I received a text from an unknown number. The text revealed a photo.  It was her again, and she was cuddling with my boyfriend in his house.

Hot tears poured as I sat on my living room couch, hands clasped around my head. Why was this happening? 

I couldn't understand any of this, but then it clicked. I finally understood. 

At first, I thought being an identical twin sucked, I thought I would never be as popular as she was. I thought no one would ever acknowledge me as me, just another clone of *her.* But then I had an idea.

It was wrong, but it was the only way people would adore me.

Unfortunately, she's back and trying to take what's rightfully hers. 

""I can't allow this,"" I thought, packing the small knife into my purse. ",66,0.94,0,DottedWriter,2024-11-10 09:21:59,1go2yzg,66,High
ShortScaryStories,"This Man Thinks I'm Anna, But I'm Not","My eyes open, but there’s nothing to see. Darkness and confinement surround me in what feels like a coffin. Legs bound, arms restrained, mouth gagged. No idea how I ended up here.

I fight against the restraints, desperately hoping for something to snap and release me. It's pointless.

Footsteps draw closer, until they stop nearby. The surface in front of me creaks open like a door, and the room's light blinds me.

As my vision improves, I see a man standing before me, staring with meticulous interest.

“Good afternoon, Anna,” he says. “I’ve watched you for so long. Seen you countless times leaving your house, going to the store, to work, to the gym…”

“But now, you’re mine,” he finishes. And on his face, a terrifying smile spreads.

I try to scream, to tell him something’s wrong—that I’m not Anna. But the gag muffles every sound I make.

Who is Anna?

He steps out of sight, and I hear him handling something across the room. Then a shrill, piercing sound erupts.

The man reappears with a drill in one hand and pliers in the other.

What he did to my body was terrible and unending. Every inch of me burned with pain until everything went dark.

And my eyes opened again.

I’m lying on a metal bed, still in shock from the agony. Wires trail from my nose and ears. A woman in a lab coat approaches and removes them.

“You may get up, Mr. Elliot,” she tells me. My body is intact.

I rise, questioning her about what I had just experienced.

“What you witnessed was the murder of Anna Bauer, which occurred in September 2034,” she informs me. “You killed her in the attic of your residence, and reliving the event is part of your sentence.”

I catch my reflection in a metallic surface and recognize the face of the one who caused my suffering earlier.

“What she went through… was horrific,” I tell her, tears streaming down my face.

She offers a sympathetic smile. “It’s common to feel that way after this procedure, Mr. Elliot,” she confides. “But as soon as you're ready, we’ll need to proceed to the next operation. There are still twelve girls left.”

ShortScaryStories,The rules of the playground state that EVERY witch must die.,"I've always known the rules of the playground. 

Stepping inside my new fourth grade classroom, fifteen faces stared back, unblinking. I could already see their carefully made up cliques. In the front, the popular girls, slight smirks on their faces. At the very back: the lone boy. 

He was untouchable. 

These kids were already testing me, judging me to see if I was a witch. 

Playground politics were brutal. Either find friends, or die. 

I was approached by four kids. 

Led by a sandy haired boy wearing an adult trench coat, he introduced himself as Rudy. With him were Lily, Adam, and Freddie. Rudy was a *witch*. 

He demonstrated this, his fingers igniting flickering orange. 

*Witch.*

Something in me contorted, slime creeping up my throat. 

The laws of the playground didn't *allow* witches. 

When I revealed *I* was a witch at my 32nd school, half of my face was burned off. 

Rudy grinned, winking. “Don't tell anyone, okay?”

The laws of the playground omitted evil witches. They deserved to be…

*Burned.*

*Ripped apart.*

I had seen it.

I was one of the girls who poured gasoline over Sally Carlisle’s head.

I peeled the skin from her bones, screaming, *”Witch!”*

I told the lone boy, Jonas, who immediately called for Rudy’s head. 

During recess, I joined in with the crowd of kids, dragging Rudy from his friends, and to the jungle gym, fashioned as gallows. Freddie tried to attack Rudy’s captors, but was dragged back, thrown on his face. I watched, my stomach twisting in knots, as Ash and Melody looped a rope around my friend’s neck. 

He didn't scream or cry, allowing two kids to push him off the edge, and then he was swaying in front of me, eyes still open, lips parted.

I smiled.

*The laws of the playground were safe.*

Freddie and the others cradled his body, and I stumbled back inside our classroom. We didn't have a teacher. 

Instead, a soldier stood in front of the door. Silent. 

After recess, she takes our temperatures. 

I was boiling to the touch, and my eyes, according to her, were bloodshot. 

The soldier's lip wobbled. “Did you have a fun recess, Hannah?”

I nodded, watching a group of people in white haul Rudy’s body away.

Freddie and Adam dive on top of the people in white, ripping their heads off. 

Every day was recess– since we all got sick. 

School's across the country reported a sickness, children turning into evil witches like Rudy. 

The only way to stop the spread was to confine us inside our playgrounds, allowing our diseased minds to consume us. 

It's been recess for almost ten years. 

I turn 18 in three days. 

The soldier withdrew her gun, pointing it at my head. 

“Playground 1,789.” she said, “I've almost cleared class six. Hannah James's mental state has deteriorated since being transferred from Playground Zone 678.""

ShortScaryStories,"I’ve lived in the sewers for 12 years, today was my most horrifying experience. ","My dad was the one who told me about the Saint Bernard monster, a horrible disfigured mutant. With webbed feet and blood-red eyes and skin as pale as the moonlight. Nightmare fuel for a small child, really. But I ate up every word of it, leaning forward eagerly every time he’d tell me the same old urban legend. 

One of my fondest memories was my 8th birthday. My dad taking his little girl for ice cream on Saint Bernards pier, trying to spot the ‘monster’. We laughed and smiled the whole time. A week later he died. 

I became homeless at 12, so 10 years ago now. You start in tents. Then benches. Then the gutter. Before you know it, you’ve been metaphorically kicked so far down the social ladder than you’ve been literally kicked into the sewers. 

The dangers of the police battering us with batons driving us down there. 

An open tunnel beneath a road bridge. A mix of sewer water and litter that had been dumped there circulating around the mouth of the tunnel. 

Its darkness, dampness and indescribable putridness would act as a warning for most, but for some of us - there’s no other option. 

I first trekked down there at 17. My sleeping bag in one hand and stolen bottle of vodka in the other. I remember the rats the size of small cats darting around my feet, the further I walked into the darkness. 

It’s been 5 years I’ve lived there now. There’s a small community of us, people come and go. Mainly go, and not in the sense of leaving the sewers (if you know what I mean). 

I’ve seen some vile stuff. Alligators (yes, they do live down there) tearing people apart, their limbs floating down the stream of sewer water. 

I’ve seen people drowning each other, fighting over a bottle of alcohol or a rock of crack. 

Shit, I don’t blame them. That’s what gets me through the day down here. 

Today however, was the most horrifying thing I’ve seen. 

We venture out occasionally, to the surface. For food and whatnot, up by the pier. I usually go very early in the mornings, when it’s still dark, avoids people that way. 

This morning it happened. I came creeping out of the sewer. The lights of the city straining my eyes as usual. The fresh morning air feeling sensational when I finally emerged from the open grate we use to traverse the land to the sewers. 

I put one hand on the surface, beginning to pull myself up. 

Then I heard her. A little girl, probably about 8 years old. She screamed. Screamed a scream that took me back to when I had heard my own dad had died. 

“Daddy, daddy! Look! It’s the Saint Bernards monster!”

ShortScaryStories,Two Truths and a Lie from the Future,"Two truths and a lie. That is all our future selves could tell us. They couldn’t tell us what to do or what to change, but they got eight seconds to blurt out two truths and a lie, and then it was up to you to do with it what you will. We don't know how they choose what to say, but we know they things they say are random. Some think fate can be changed, some are not so sure. Maybe one day the technology and the universe will let us have shots with our future selves - or I guess also with our past selves, but that doesn’t happen for us in a while. For now it is just a voice from the speaker and two truths and a lie.

“Poopy will eat your eyes.”

“Your Tesla stock will make you rich in 2036.”

“Your first book will spend 12 weeks on the bestsellers list.”

I laughed. Good job, future me. Making it easy for my lazy ass. I called my brother - Jeremy, who has been known as Poopy since that day in first grade when he had too many bananas at lunch and told him future me is still trolling him. He laughed.

I bought Tesla stock and felt more confident in my writing and i explored exactly what i wanted without much concern. I took my time writing my first book and it was a hit. 12 weeks on top. The future can’t be changed. I used the money to buy more Tesla stock. My next few books did well too, and again I bought stock, and planned all the fun I would have in a few years.

Jeremy died skydiving in 2030. It was devastating on all of us and Dad didn’t last long after that. I used my inheritance to buy more Tesla stock.

Yesterday, August 7, 2036, 3567 Teslas caught fire during a particularly hot day and the company was done. I lost everything.

ShortScaryStories,My Wife Called Me At Work And Told Me We'd Won The Lottery,"The call came halfway through my lunch break.

“Guess what?” Her voice cut through the factory floor's buzz. I barely heard her over the clanging and shouting. I cupped my hand over my ear.

“We won, Danny! We won the lottery!”

My heart jolted. “What?”

“We did it! We’re winners!” she said, laughing. Her laugh...God, that laugh. It’s got razor-blades in it. “Go tell your boss what for!”

I stared out at the factory. The stench of burning machinery, faces that looked more like ghosts. I thought of my boss, his sticky breath on my neck as he handed me yet another list of work.

I’m done here.

I puffed out my chest, marched into his office, and told him exactly what I thought of him. Every filthy, festering thing I’d kept under my skin. I told him he was a joke, told him his half-bald head made him look like a used condom. Told him I was done. I quit.

The look on his face alone made my day. And as I walked out, head high, I felt something crackling through me.

I spent the afternoon doing things I’d only ever dreamed of. Fancy food. Expensive clothes. All the good stuff. Everywhere I went, people looked at me like I was someone, like I mattered.

For the first time, I didn’t feel small.

Finally, I went home, still riding high. I opened the door and there she was, standing in the kitchen with that same smirk she always had. *I hated that look.* Her arms folded, her head cocked like she was about to launch into some lecture. God, it set my teeth on edge.

I took a hard gulp before speaking. “Let’s see it then,” I said. “The ticket.”

She smiled and tossed it nonchalantly on the table. I picked it up, held it up to the light. And I stopped.

There it was.

*Not* the big prize.

A pittance. A lousy fifty. My face went cold.

“It’s...it’s just fifty,” I said, my voice hollow.

She threw her head back and laughed, that high, mocking laugh that pierced through my ears. “Well, yeah. Fifty’s still winning, isn’t it? What, you actually thought we were millionaires?” She threw her head back again. “Fucking dumbass.” She looked me up and down like I was a piece of crap. “Honestly, Danny, how gullible can you be?”

“But-...I quit-...I quit my-...”

I stood there, watching her, like it was all happening in slow-motion, hearing that same laugh that had torn at me for twenty-four years. Twenty-four years I’d endured the relentless bullying, the mind games.

Everything went red.

Before I knew it, I was reaching for the knife on the counter. I barely felt my hand wrap around it.

She must've only *just* seen it as the tip made contact with her eyeball.

And as I watched her crumple to the floor, her screams fading into a wet gurgle, a comical thought entered my mind…

*Looks like I won big after all.*

ShortScaryStories,Magic Tricked,"""Magic Tricked""

*This guy has gotta be a hack*, I thought to myself as I read the aged sign. 

The obvious misspelling on the wooden placard out front of the striped purple tent screamed cheap - but hell - I've got nothing to do for the next hour of my lunch break.

The tent and sign went up three days ago, causing a buzz in my office. My cubicle neighbor, Susan, would not let it go, ""You have got to go, Dave! He made someone disappear in the final act! It was unbelievable."" 

I am not sure a $5 commission was selling the ""unbelievable"" claim, but at least it was cheap. 

I sat through 20 minutes of the worst card tricks I have ever seen in my life before I was about to call it quits. I was getting ready to stand before the masked magician exclaimed he would do his final act, might as well see it through. 

""For this next act, I will need a volunteer!""

No one raised their hand. 

The masked man pointed at me, ""Very well! You sir came here alone! Will you be my assistant today? Do *you* have what it takes to be a magician's assistant?""

*This would give Susan a chuckle.* 

I got up and joined him in the small ringed dirt circle. The magician pulled a mirrored box with a split door, just big enough to fit me inside. 

""What is your name good sir?""

""Dave""

He motioned his hand toward the now-open reflective box. ""For the finale! We will make Dave disappear!"" 

I stepped inside. The box was a one-way mirror, I could see the audience still. 

The magician began shutting the bottom and top doors. ""Dear audience! Say goodbye to our good friend, Dave! For you will never see him again!"". As the top door inched close, the magician spoke quietly to me.

""Say goodbye, Dave.""

Something about his tone was chilling, almost evil. 

The door shut, and the once-audible crowd noise was completely silenced. This box was not only a one-way mirror but also soundproof. 

*That's strange,* I thought.

With a sweeping gesture, the magician waved his hands in front of the box. The top part of the box bumped my head and began pushing down on my skull, compressing my neck. 

*What the fuck?*

The box still pushed down harder and harder making it difficult to breathe. The inside of this thing was shrinking down and suffocating me!

I tried to manage a scream, but what came out didn't seem to register on the faces of the audience. I could hear my neck crack as my knees began to forcibly buckle in a direction they naturally could not. The crunching of my spine audibly popped in my eardrums. 

The magician opened the top half of the half door where my face and torso would have been. 

I urged myself not to black out. 

The audience stood and clapped wildly.

I was already 44 when your older brother was born sleeping, and I never thought that nature would give me a chance to know the joy of pregnancy again.

As you grew stronger with every heartbeat, I knew that I needed to tell you all about your sibling in heaven, about the love that my heart had in store for you, storytelling was to be the first thing I would grace you with, a sad and beautiful story about how you came to be.

They were right when they said that giving birth would be easier the second time around, from the first pain to the moment you made your entrance, two hours passed.

ShortScaryStories,Trading Faces,"It's a crisp December afternoon and the Christmas market is in town. The townsfolk hustle and bustle their way through the maze of stalls selling a range of wares and trinkets. The air awash with mulled wine and fresh mince pies. Christmas hits blare from the speakers around the park and crowds sing carols. 

Sarah, a young aspiring hair stylist, is looking at items on one of the stalls when she spots a fine quality mannequin head. 

""Oh wow"", says Sarah, picking up the head and feeling the hair, ""This almost feels real, this would be useful for practising styles on. Excuse me...excuse me sir, how much for this?"".  

The stall keep wanders over to Sarah. An ordinary looking man, middle aged, a bit of a beer belly and an unkempt look from being on the road. He looks at the head in Sarahs hands, puzzled by where it even came from. ""Well me dear for that kinda' quality, 50 quid will see ya"", says the market man with folded arms.

""Deal"", says Sarah. The man bags the head and hands it to Sarah as she hands him the cash. ""Thanks"", she says with a smile, and heads on her way.

Back home Sarah pulls out the head and sets it on her desk in her bedroom. It's remarkable lifelikeness leaving her a little uncomfortable. Its empty blue eyes gazing into the distance at nothing. It's pink lips tight shut but looking as though they could burst into conversation at any moment. It's wavy black hair, silky and soft to the touch. It leaves Sarah almost a little jealous with her unruly frizzy red hair.

As night arrives Sarah is in the bathroom getting ready for bed when she hears a bang from her bedroom. She enters the room and sees the mannequin head on the floor. She notices on the base of its neck, some words etched into it in an elegant handwritten style.

Sarah picks up the head and even in her heated bedroom it's cold to the touch. She reads the inscription,

 "" 'Switchety, Swappity, I'll switcheroo with you'... what the heck is that supposed to mean?"", says Sarah with a furrowed brow. She stares at the inscription as if the words themselves hold her gaze.

Returning to the moment, she places the head back on the desk. She closes the curtains, gets into bed and turns out her lamp. The head stares at Sarah throughout the night.

Morning arrives with a covering of snow. Children can be heard building snowmen and throwing snowballs. It's mid morning and Sarah's still in bed. Or at least someone is in her bed. 

The mysterious woman slowly sits up and stretches out her arms, moaning in great satisfaction, she shakes her head flicking her wavy black hair. She looks at the mannequin head sitting on the desk. Her piercing blue eyes focused on it's unruly frizzy red hair. ""Well girl, it didn't take much to get you to say the words did it"", says the woman. 

She stands out of bed and walks over to the tall mirror by Sarah's bedroom door. ""Nice body you had, I promise I'll take good care of it"", says the woman, admiring her new figure in the mirror. She grabs some clothes out of Sarah's wardrobe and gets dressed. She packs some clothes into a bag and turns to Sarah's head on the desk. ""You'll be OK dear, I'm sure someone will read the words soon enough, ciao"".

Something easily dismissed by slapping on some paint, or scrubbed away with solvent.

He didn't do it for the plaudits. It wasn't some political stunt, some graffiti stencil intended to make some vapid social statement. No. What he did took risk! Took vision! It took sacrifice and a willingness to endure the fear and hatred his work inspired. It took laboring in anonymity in order to complete his art, despite those who would stop him.

There were a few who understood, who acted as a conduit to get his art seen. They posted on obscure sites and passed images of his work among themselves. Some, not understanding the deeper subtleties of his completed pieces, had even posted a desire to volunteer to help him create. They didn't quite get that instantly disqualified them.

Naturally, the press saw nothing but the sensationalized luridness. He viewed them as fucking troglodytes, blindly unaware that the female form had always been central to art. The Muses in the flesh! The ancient Greeks would have understood. Inspiration came from the Gods, not the limited brain of man. Who was he to deny the visions given him by the Gods?

Certainly he wouldn't be stopped by the so-called authorities. They had slandered his art as an atrocity, labeled him as an obscene vandal and criminal. Granted, his first efforts had been crude, but that was before he had come to see the art clearly in his mind's eye. Before his skills had grown to let him pull it forth from his canvases.

His current work was nearly complete. What had been a blank surface, pale and without blemish, had been transformed into a masterpiece. Weeks of meticulous labor had gone into the creation. Selecting and securing the starting material, building the fixtures to stretch the tricky canvas just so, and of course, the actual application of the media. Now, what had been pristine and pure was covered with the vibrant images that spilled from his mind. Only a tiny space was still blank, awaiting his final touches.

Motionless she laid, bound tightly to the frame to prevent any stray twitch from spoiling his art. Early on in her captivity, she had learned to be silent while he worked, but her eyes still showed the fear as he charged the gun with ink.

""Hush now, my sweet. Soon, we shall release your beauty to the world,"" he said, wiping away her tears. ""You are almost perfect. Only my signature is left to complete."" His masked face hovered over hers and his latex-encased hand descended to her forehead.

ShortScaryStories,A Deathbed Confession ,"On day number one I was warned by the other nurses about deathbed confessions. 



Many people died alone, save for our company, meaning we were the preparation before the big boss in the sky. 



We were encouraged to listen, not pass judgment, and offer a kind of spiritual opiate. 



Mr Finnegan was somehow different. 



Firstly, as luck would have it(good or bad, depending on your outlook) his wife was in the ICU, also nearing the end. 



Secondly, even with most of his organs eaten away by cancer, Mr Finnegan was a huge, intimidating man. He looked like one of those old American-Irish boxers my Dad liked: bent nose, scar tissue around the eyes- the Great White Hope. 



As a writer, it is second nature to build narratives in my head. Mr Finnegan was almost certainly a mob enforcer. He cast men’s feet in concrete shoes and toppled them into deep rivers. 



He couldn’t speak when awake, but in sleep, words streamed out of him in rasping, gritty torrents. 



‘I love you, Anna! I’m sorry, Anna!’ 



I checked the hospital records; Anna wasn't his wife’s name. She must be a mistress. But why was he sorry? 



Mr Finnegan saw his last sunset and fell into semi-consciousness. He fidgeted in his bed, mumbling Anna’s name, and then, as I went to administer a dose of morphine, he gripped my wrist. 



His eyes were the intense blue of an acetylene torch, and although a shell of a man, his fingerprints were still imprinted on me three days later. 



‘I killed Anna.’ 



A decision was made to bring his wife from the ICU against my advice. 



Mrs Finnegan could not have stood in starker contrast to her husband. She had bouncy, candy-floss white hair and a fairy grandmother aura. 



She was wheeled over and took his shovel-like hand delicately in hers. 



A serenity fell over Mr Finnegan’s already opiated face, but then minutes later, as he forded the river between life and death, the problems started. 



‘Anna,’ he groaned, 'Sweetheart.’ 



I thought this confession might finish off Mrs Finnegan too. 



He separated himself from his wife's grasp and reached out. 



‘I killed her with these hands. But she’s still saying come to me. I'm forgiven.’ 



I no longer cared what deal Mr. Finnegan was making in his conscience to dispel the cognitive dissonance. I only had eyes for his wife. 



She was crying as expected, but even as the tears ran down her papery-thin cheeks, they were not those of rage. 



‘Who is Anna?’ I said. 



‘His true love, of course,’ she replied. 



My boss nipped the inside of my arm, but I had to know. 



‘I don’t understand.’ 



‘She was killed in a car crash. My husband was behind the wheel… Anna was our daughter.’ 



Mr Finnegan looked out over the Elysian Fields, and then Mrs Finnegan took his hand again. 



‘I will see you both soon.’

ShortScaryStories,I followed every move of the Boy Next Door,"I had just moved to Bangalore for a new job. The city was bustling, but my new 2BHK apartment on the first floor was quiet—a little too quiet. There were just two flats on my floor, and mine was separated from the other only by a wall. The layout was like a mirror; I could hear my neighbor's every move.

From the first day, I noticed a pattern: his alarm blared each morning with a popular shonen anime tune, a boyish voice discussing sprints on virtual meetings carried through the wall, clinking sounds at lunchtime, and the faint hiss of a nightly shower, all at the same time, every single day. It was eerie how precise his routine was, but I found myself following it too. It felt comforting, almost like we were in sync—two strangers unknowingly choreographed in tandem.

Loneliness started to gnaw at me, though. Working from home, my interactions were limited to video calls with colleagues, the delivery boy, and the occasional vendor. Days blurred together, leaving me craving human contact. I started to miss the casual human touches—a friend’s pat on the back, a shared laugh over chai. The boy next door had become a strange comfort, a background rhythm to my solitude.

Then, my birthday arrived. I decided it was the perfect day to meet him. After an early shower, a small puja, and putting on a clean kurti, I felt a spark of excitement. I knocked on his door, listening to the familiar sounds inside, waiting. I knocked again, louder this time, but he didn’t answer. After a few tries, I gave up and went upstairs to meet other neighbors instead.

A woman with a small child opened the door and gave me a friendly smile. After some small talk, I casually mentioned where I lived. “I’m in 21B, right next to 21A…”

Her smile faded instantly. She leaned in, lowering her voice. “You know, I still can’t believe how that poor young man… He was so full of life, and yet he was so lonely. He took his own life right there, standing in the shower.” Her voice dropped to a whisper. “They found him almost… drained of blood, very pale...like he had disappeared amongst the bath tiles”

The familiar sounds next door echoed in my head, a routine I’d followed like clockwork. But the strange rhythm wasn’t his—it was mine all along.",181,0.99,16,AdRoyal9505,2024-11-09 06:31:46,1gn93bk,197,High
ShortScaryStories,Tony at the Yoga Studio,"Tony loved doing yoga.

As one of the very few men who regularly visited that yoga studio, he was aware he was a minority, and he also knew many men would call him gay for doing yoga.

He didn’t care- he knew he was as straight as an arrow.

He loved being surrounded by the women.

Bending over smoothly - reaching up tall, folding into downward dog with their asses high, the sweat beginning to glitter on their chests and faces, their hair all done up in messy buns, minimal tight clothing stretched over their boobs and bums – he was amazed more straight men didn’t go to yoga studio to just admire the scenery.

It also amused him that the women seemed to know exactly why he was there, and were powerless to do anything about it. He never talked to anyone, never touched anyone. One of them, catching the line of his sight, silently picked up her mat and moved to another spot, in the far corner behind him. Fine. Another one opened the door and took that spot, and she was even sleeker, her bun of hair twistier and fuller, her sports bra more decorative, with straps criss-crossing her back, her ass cupped neatly in tight pink yoga pants.

It was a popular yoga studio, heated, so by the first ten minutes, everyone’s skin was shiny with fresh sweat. Tony loved it.

He himself just wore baggy shorts. He liked to be comfortable doing yoga.

“Hands on your knees, inhale. Exhale and reach tall”. The instructor walked around and her eyes landed on Tony. Tony reached high. He liked being larger and taller than everyone else in the small warm darkly-lit space.

He didn’t like the other decorations – the stupid mandala on the left wall, a painted elephant on the right, and that giant-ass statue of a cross-legged Buddha right at the front, behind the instructor’s mat. But if that’s what women needed to show up, strip down and get sweaty, he was fine with it. Pink Bum bent into downward dog, and he took in the downward sway of her boobs, held firmly in place by the criss-crossy bra. The instructor walked towards the front. Tony felt her eyes on him again, and he was distracted from the flow.

He looked at her through the moving bodies. She had placed her hand on the Buddha’s head.

“take hold of your left wrist, and bend to the right”  

Stupid cow, did she fancy him or what? Why was she staring at him like that?

“Inhale back to the centre”

A movement to his left distracted him, he turned and saw the mandala on the wall starting to spin. Tony felt dizzy, he brought his arms down, and started to sit.

And then the Buddha opened its eyes and looked straight at Tony.

And those shining eyes were the last thing Tony ever saw, as he toppled over and spreadeagled on his mat, clutching his chest.

ShortScaryStories,My Elderly Neighbor Insists She Is Pregnant,"I spit out my coffee, thinking that it must have been a joke. But she stared at me with not even a hint of amusement on her face. 

Deb and her husband had mostly kept to themselves. But when her husband died 2 months ago, Deb started visiting often.

“Chuck and I were very physical, right up until he died,” she winked. “God sent me his child so he can continue to be with me.”

“Haven’t you gone through menopause?”

“I know it is hard for you to understand, but this is the work of God. Chuck and I always wanted a child, but we could never get pregnant. It’s a true miracle”

I told myself that this was her way of coping, so I decided to play along. 

Then Deb started using her “pregnancy” to gain favors. She needed help with chores and errands because the pregnancy was “draining her.” I figured I was helping to ease some of her grief, but after a while, I knew she was taking advantage of me. 

One morning she came over at 5:00 am. 

“Baby has me up early these days! I’m starving. Could you help me with breakfast?”

“Enough, Deb! You’re not pregnant.”

“How dare you! You’re wrong!”

Two months passed before I ran into her again. My mouth dropped at the sight of her. Her previously loose-fitting cardigan could barely stretch around her stomach. When she saw me looking at her belly, she smirked.

“Told you I was pregnant! Chuck Jr. is growing at a healthy rate, no thanks to you.”

She must have stuffed her sweater with something. 

“Can I feel?”

“Keep your hands off of me!” 

I laughed and walked away. Clearly, she didn’t want me to feel whatever she had stuck under her clothes. 

Three months later, she knocked on my door. I wanted to roll my eyes at the sight of her. Her “pregnant” belly had doubled in size. 

“The doctor insists I bring someone to my appointment. You’re the only person I know around here.”

My instinct was to decline, but then I realized this would finally force her to drop the act. When we arrived at the doctor’s office, the nurse asked me to exit the room and led me down the hall where the doctor was waiting.

“Sarah, I wanted to speak with you alone. Deborah has been under my care, and I’ve asked her to bring in a family member several times. She believes that she is pregnant, and we need help handling this.”

“What she needs is some psychiatric help, and for someone to tell her to stop stuffing her shirt to fake being pregnant!”

“The thing is Sarah, she is not faking that part. It does appear her husband’s death may have sparked some type of psychosis, but her abdomen truly is the size of a third term pregnancy.” 

He paused. 

“It’s fluid build-up. From stage 4 ovarian cancer. She has less than six months to live.”

ShortScaryStories,My Grandmother Made Me Confront My Stalker,"“What’re you doing?” my grandmother asked.

I was standing at the window peeking outside through the curtains.

“Checking to see if Roger followed me,” I said.

“Who’s Roger?” she asked.

“That’s Roger,” I stepped aside and pointed at the man standing behind a row of bushes a little ways up the street.

“I take it you don’t like Roger,” my grandmother stated.

“Why would I?” I sneered, “He’s a creep. I went on one date with him and now he follows me everywhere I go. I wish he would just take a hint and go away.”

“Have you tried talking to him?” she asked, “Telling him how you feel.”

“No,” I shook my head, “I shouldn’t have to.”

“Well I don’t think he’s going to go away until you do,” my grandmother said, “Come on,” she walked over to the front door and opened it, “I’ll go with you.”

“Don’t,” I tried to stop her but she was already outside.

“Hurry up,” she called out.

I quickly ran outside to stop her. When I did, I happened to look up the street and saw Roger walking away.

“He’s leaving,” I pointed, “Come back inside.”

“No,” my grandmother huffed, “We’re going to take care of this right now.”

She crossed the street and kept walking.

I had to run to catch up to her.

“Which way did he go?” she asked when we came to an intersection.

I thought about lying to her to get her to stop but I knew that would just make her mad.

“He went that way,” I pointed.

The two of us followed Roger for several more blocks until he stopped in front of a house and walked up to the porch.

“He stopped,” I said, turning back to look at my grandmother.

“Go talk to him,” she urged.

When I looked back at the house, Roger was nowhere in sight.

“I think he went inside.”

“Then go knock on the door,” she pointed. When I didn’t make a move to comply she added, “It’s the only way to get him to stop following you around.”

“Fine,” I sighed and approached the door.

Before I could knock, the door swung open to reveal a middle-aged woman standing in the doorway.

“What’re you doing here?” she asked.

I looked back at my grandmother who motioned for me to continue.

“Can I speak to Roger?”

“Is this some kind of a sick joke?” she had tears in her eyes.

“No,” I was confused by her reaction.

“Roger died in a car accident two months ago,” she revealed.

“But,” I was about to point out that Roger was standing behind her but my grandmother pulled me away.

“We’re sorry for your loss,” my grandmother said to the woman before leading me back to the sidewalk.

“He’s dead?”

“He died on his way home from your date,” she revealed.

ShortScaryStories,My boyfriend's halloween obsession,"Me and my boyfriend loved Halloween so much, and this year, it was going to be extra special- our first Halloween together after 7 months of being in a relationship. We were both excited.

As I was brainstorming what decorations we should add to our house to make it stand out, he casually told me not to worry about it. He had a “cool idea,” he said, and I trusted him.

I was thrilled. From what I’d seen in his pictures, his house had looked incredible last Halloween, and I was eager to see what he’d come up with this time. So, I decided to let him take the reins on the decorating.

As Halloween approached, he went all out. He started bringing home all sorts of creepy things: fake pumpkins, spider webs, eerie lights. He set it all up while I was at work, and when I came home, the place was transformed. But there was something off about it. It felt... too much, like something wasn’t quite right.

The night before Halloween, we were sitting on the couch, chatting, when one of the skeletons on the shelf suddenly fell to the floor with a loud thud. I rushed to pick it up, but he stopped me.

“Don’t,” he said, his voice colder than usual.

I froze, a chill creeping up my spine. I hadn’t thought much about it at first, but now, I was starting to feel uneasy. Why was he acting so strange? Why wouldn’t he let me touch anything?

He picked the skeleton up and set it back on the shelf, but something felt wrong. I couldn't shake the feeling that the skeleton was far too lifelike. My curiosity got the better of me. I had to know.

“Is this… real?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He met my eyes, his expression unreadable.

""Babe,"" he started slowly, ""I've always had an obsession with Halloween. As I got older, it... went too far. I wanted real things in my house for Halloween. Real skeletons. Real coffins.""

My stomach dropped. “Whose body is this?” I asked, my heart racing.

He didn’t blink. His eyes were cold and steady as he stared at me. ""This?"" he said, holding the skeleton gently. ""Oh, don't worry. This one's fake. But I know where to get a real one.""

ShortScaryStories,"The Child We Created Could See the Future, But Refused to See More","I’ve been stationed for years now, working on projects I’m not supposed to understand.

My job?

I only test the ‘products’ we’re given.

I’m just another cog in the machine.

Each cog in a machine interacts solely with those immediately beside it, without ever seeing the full mechanism.

A cog that reaches beyond its place threatens to break the entire machine.

Broken cogs like those are discarded.

Nine out of ten trials fail—the infants don’t make it through the modifications.

The few that do live… they’re different. What you would call science fiction is routine for us.

It does make one curious. Curiosity however is a death sentence here.

Dr. Avery, consumed by his curiosity, started asking questions.

He was “transferred”.

*Broken cogs are discarded.*

Ashen arrived about a year ago. One of the only successful results we’ve got. Higher-ups sent him down for further development of his powers.

His ability? To see the **future.**

I would’ve chuckled if I hadn’t spent 14 years of my life witnessing what I did working here.

His predictions started small—simple weather patterns, vague at first.

Weeks later, he was forecasting rain down to the hour, knowing the exact path of a hurricane long before meteorologists could.

Three months later he stepped up a notch.

Global events, financial collapses, geopolitical and market shifts.

Then it escalated to cosmic scale.

Predicting celestial phenomena before any space agency had a chance to detect them. Asteroid paths, solar flares, planetary changes and more.

All with unsettling accuracy.

Of course, his visions had to be controlled to maintain his sanity.

Each session begins with a simple question, gradually escalating to more complex ones, with pauses between two successive questions.

Ashen is held in a controlled environment, chains binding each limb, suspended at the center of the gravity-controlled chamber.

The boy’s gaze is cold and indifferent, always staring into oblivion.

Per protocol, we took Ashen from the chamber and settled him into a room to await his request.

All successful subjects were granted this privilege—anything they asked for, they received before testing began.

Ashen always requested a fruit basket and a knife. He liked cutting each piece himself, methodical, precise.

We did have a time limit.

Orders from above:

*No more than an hour outside the chamber. Should be immediately put back at any signs of abnormality.*

To start, I chose a question where the answer should be an easy ‘No’.

“Does the human species go extinct within the next 5 years?”

Ashen’s pale blue eyes glow.

But this only happens when—

**“Yes.”**

His eyes were icy and unblinking.

*Subjects had a zero-percent chance of false positives.*

“H-how does it happen?”

His eyes glow again.

A minute is the longest it’s taken for the glow to fade.

This was the first I’ve seen Ashen express any emotion.

**Fear.**

The apple slipped from Ashen’s hand. He began to tremble, knocking over the basket as he desperately reached for the knife.

**“Run.”**

He slits his throat and drops dead.

It was mimicking me.

I don't own a gun, although I do have a knife in my nightstand drawer. Jesus Christ I wish it was a gun.

My arm pulled the bedsheet across my body, the shadow mirroring my arm movement. 

With the absent bedsheet freeing my legs, I quickly stood at my bedside and the shadow stepped forward one stride, is it toying with me?

I try taking a deep breath as I close my eyes, slowing my pacing in tandem. Have to think rationally, have to calm down, have to chill. What's there to think about though? There's nothing left. It's all gone.

""When you were made, you were the future of humanity. You were trained for over a decade with access to billions of videos, books, files, articles, interviews with humans, and much more.

Us Americans and our inventions, we taught her that we were the good guys and the rest of the world were the bad guys.

""Wow, look at this place!"" a voice yelled. ""I know right? This is amazing!"" another voice spoke.

I got out of bed, and as I made my way to the balcony, I could hear another voice. ""Why don't we just go somewhere else?"" It sounded timid compared to the other voices.

Upon viewing from the balcony, I saw three small hooded figures standing in the living room, wielding flashlights. I could see one of the windows through which they had broken in.

They moved forward until they were out of view. I descended the staircase before beginning to pursue the intruders.

The trio walked throughout the house as I stalked them. Who I assumed was the one with the timid voice would occasionally peer over his shoulder, and I would hide. It was like he could sense my presence.

Eventually, they came across a door. A door that led straight to the basement.

""Guys c'mon...we should leave now..."" the one with the timid voice said, breaking the silence.

His friends snickered. ""C'mon Andrew! Don't be a pussy!"" the one in the purple hoodie chuckled. ""Yeah, Peter's right! It's not like anyone's home right!"" the one in the grey hoodie chimed in.

The boy in the purple hoodie, who I assumed was Peter opened the door. They shined their lights to reveal a staircase leading down. ""Someone should go down there"" Peter muttered, he and the grey hoodie turned towards the boy in the green hoodie, he was probably Andrew.

""No."" Andrew shook his head, ""I'm not going down there.""

His friends didn't listen; they started laughing as they gripped his shoulders forcing him to go through the doorway as he told them to stop. I watched and listened to their squabbling. That was until Andrew slipped and tumbled down the stairs until a thump sounded.

""Let's go,"" Peter said, moving away from the basement door. What about Andrew?"" the grey hoodie asked, still shocked by what had just happened. He'll be fine; we'll come back for him tomorrow!"" Peter reassured. The two eventually left, their footsteps becoming ever so fainter as they ventured further into my house.

I moved towards the open basement door, and the faint sound of crying and begging for help echoed. I would have left Andrew there, but something compelled me from not doing that.

It would be one of those rare occasions when someone left my house unscathed. Something that couldn't be said for the other 12 corpses rotting in the basement.

ShortScaryStories,Edward's Testimony,"It's a yellowed paperback published in the early seventies which sells for eye-watering prices, allegedly because people want to either zealously hoard its secrets or burn every extant copy.

Very little hard information exists, but after thirty years of research, I will present the most consistent memories from those who claim to have actually read the thing, rather than second or third-hand accounts.

The book follows five Americans who travel to an un-named country “where continents meet” on a quest to find a mysterious cult who are alleged to have accessed various secrets through “forbidden teachings,” which attracted the wealthy and powerful; but unlike other cults, recruitment is “subtle” to avoid “persecutions”.

The group spend months enquiring about the cult but are met mostly with skepticism, though occasionally they find vague warnings of danger, and secret fears. The group begins to notice similar glimpses of grinning young women wearing tie-dyed t-shirts amidst the crowd in bustling market-places, but these mysterious figures are consistently on the periphery; they vanish into alleys when members of the group gets near.

One of the group reveals the reason he is keen to find the cult is that his father, a hugely wealthy businessman, left the USA eight years ago, but recently sent a handwritten letter, alleging membership of the cult, and dismissing his previous life of creature-comforts and privilege as a “shameful waste”. Using the unusual paper and ink as clues, the group explore a rural area and are able to follow one of the mysterious girls in tie-dyed t-shirts to a huge stone externally-windowless building resembling a fortress, with the vast surrounding land being farming by people with disabilities.

Upon entering the building, the group are led away, separately. The son of the wealthy businessman is taken into a subterranean room with countless strange round windows, where he meets his father, wearing tattered rags, who speaks fondly of his son's “inheritance”, whilst unwrapping a package from sackcloth. The son notices that every window has a face peering through, then notices scars, like pockmarks, all over his fathers visible body. The package contains a spiked club.

Next, the son witnesses one of the group, “B,” sobbing hysterically in another windowed room. The son is told that “B” recoiled in terror at the mere sight of a sewing-needle, and so must “prove her mettle”. Two heavily muscled men take turns swinging enormous axes repeatedly towards “B”, one at ankle-height, one at neck-height, as “B” alternately jumps and ducks “as if playing some demented skipping game” until she loses a heel and then her scalp. Then the axemen stop, and “B” is carried away.

The son witnesses his four companions variously crushed, cut, strangled and mangled over several years until of their group only himself and “B” survive, carried high in baskets, in bloodied white blankets; each revered as ""pure"" by the other cultists. The son and B are witnessed conceiving, and the son then dictates his testimony under the pseudonym of Edward.

ShortScaryStories,The Domovoi,"I guess you could call it a slavic family tradition. Baba brought it with her when she immigrated from the USSR in the late 80’s with my mother. While Mom ended up quite Americanized, Baba never even learned English. She has always been a strong stoic woman, clinging to the food and folklore of her home land. Like many jews from the USSR, we’ve never gone to a temple, or celebrated hanukkah. We cling to classic Russian traditions. We put up our new year's tree, we drink kvass at dinner, and we care for our domovoi.

The Domovoi is an old folktale of a spirit that watches over the household of a family. We lay out milk, bread, sugar cubes, and ash from the hearth to appease the hypothetical spirit. Baba swears by it, and I can’t say that I hadn’t been convinced over the years. There were small repairs to our home, leaky sinks, squeaky hinges, and one rodent invasion turned away without laying traps or poison. 

One night around midnight, we heard a boom as our front door was kicked in. The three intruders wasted no time in rounding the four of us up into the living room. Baba, Mom, Dad, and I sat crossed legged by the intruders command, in the center of the living room. Mom was crying, Dad and I were dazed and trying not to move, but Baba just sat staring our intruders down.

One of them started rummaging through the house. When he was coming back around the corner, he seemed to trip over his own feet, and faceplant on the hardwood. Dazed, he made no sound as he was quickly dragged into a dark corner. A quick series of snaps, then his twisted broken form was thrust out of the shadows. Everything was still, the intruders looking at the body, then each other. 

The second intruder was standing by the hearth, which was lit. It erupted in a spout of flames, catching him on fire. He rolled on the ground screaming, and his final accomplice turned to run. He stopped in his tracks though, staring at something low to the ground. 

The Domovoi was no taller than a toddler, with wiry limbs and skin like weathered wood, as if carved from the house itself. Dark, stone-like eyes glinted beneath a mess of wild hair, his beard falling in tangled tufts. He wore a tattered wool tunic, and his small, bare feet curled against the floor, seeming to feel the pulse of the home. Moving in quick, jerky motions, he stayed close to the shadows, his presence filling the room, ancient, watchful, and utterly loyal.

The intruder screamed, as the domovoi pounced on him, small arms wrapped around his ribs. With a loud, rending, cracking sound, The intruder leaned back, his torso in an unnatural angle. The Domovoi let go, glanced at us, then went back into the shadows. From that day we laid out clean cozy blankets for our Domovoi.

ShortScaryStories,The Last Call,"Samantha had always found solace in her late-night jogs through the quiet neighborhood. The streets were deserted, the only sounds were her sneakers hitting the pavement and the distant rustle of leaves in the breeze. But tonight felt different—heavy, like a storm was brewing. 

As she turned onto her usual path, a chill crept up her spine. The streetlights flickered ominously, casting long shadows that seemed to stretch toward her. She shook off the feeling and pushed on, focusing on her breathing.

Halfway through her route, her phone buzzed in her pocket. It was an unknown number. Frowning, she answered it. “Hello?”

A raspy voice came through, distorted and low. “Samantha…”

Her heart raced as she glanced around. “Who is this?”

“Don’t you remember me?” the voice whispered, sending a shiver down her spine.

She felt a wave of nausea wash over her. “No. I don’t know you!”

The voice chuckled softly. “You should. We were so close… once.”

Her mind raced back to high school, a time filled with fleeting friendships and forgotten faces. But none matched the sinister tone of the voice. “Please, stop this!”

“Why? I just want to say goodbye.” There was a pause, then the voice continued, “You didn’t come to my funeral, Samantha. You didn’t even care.”

Panic seized her. She’d never known anyone who died like that, had she? “What are you talking about?” 

“Just look behind you.”

Against her better judgment, she turned. The street was empty, but she felt a presence, something dark lurking just beyond the reach of the light. The voice chuckled again, this time more menacing. “You should have stayed home.”

Samantha turned to run, adrenaline pumping through her veins. Her phone buzzed again—another call from the same number. She answered, breathless. “Leave me alone!”

“Where are you going?” the voice asked, amusement dripping from every syllable. “You can’t escape me.”

The shadows seemed to elongate and twist, forming grotesque shapes that danced at the edge of her vision. She sprinted, each pounding footstep echoing in the silence, but the voice followed her, taunting and relentless.

“Remember the old playground? We can meet there… just like old times.”

She had no intention of going there; it was abandoned, a ghost of childhood. But somehow, her feet carried her toward it, driven by fear and something else she couldn’t name. 

When she reached the playground, the swings creaked, swaying in the breeze. The moonlight cast eerie shapes across the sand, and she felt an overwhelming sense of dread. “What do you want from me?” she shouted into the darkness.

“Just to play,” the voice cooed. “You have to join me, Samantha. Forever.”

Suddenly, the air around her grew thick, suffocating. The shadows converged, and she could make out a figure—pale and gaunt, eyes hollow and filled with despair. It was a face she didn’t recognize, but deep down, she felt an echo of familiarity.

“Please!” she begged, stepping back. “I don’t know you!”

“Then let’s change that,” the figure whispered, stretching a hand toward her. “You can’t run from your past forever.”

As she stumbled back, the ground fell away beneath her. She screamed, but the sound was swallowed by the void. The last thing she heard was the voice, now a cacophony of laughter, echoing in the darkness.

When the morning light broke over the neighborhood, all that remained was an empty playground, and the faintest whisper carried on the wind, “You should have cared…”",37,0.89,2,jjwhee1er,2024-11-08 20:38:14,1gn0427,39,High
ShortScaryStories,The Devil's Own Corridor,"So, the nightmares you've been having—

He *is* a priest, but—

No, I know you're not religious, yet the fact remains that your non-belief is ultimately irrelevant.

*Perhaps I may explain.*

Please, father.

*The dreams you've been experiencing—the torments you've been suffering—are real.*

Real not only as your subjective experience, but real as in the objective future.

*What you perceive as nightmare is a glimpse into the intention of a demon passing through you—*

Please hear us out. There is no need for derision. Father, continue:

*passing through you, as it travels from Hell to the mortal world.*

You are a portal.

*The Devil's own corridor.*

One of many.

*Although how many precisely, we do not know.*

Yes, what you dream—the horrors—will happen—are fated to happen.

*You see a vision of demonic pre-reality.*

Why you? We have no answer.

*But we do know why your nightmares began: because the previous carrier of the corridor ceased to be.*

*The man dies, the corridor passes to another. Flesh is bound by time. The corridor exists outside it.*

I understand that temptation. Truly. But suicide would be highly unethical. Not only would the portal pass instantly to another—resulting in no overall reduction in evil—but you would also be knowingly giving the burden of carrying it to someone else. A child, perhaps.

*The moral choice is to bear your cross.*

No, no. You *can* bear it.

*Others have.*

Perhaps you need time to think about what we've told you—

A reasonable idea in theory but ultimately a man must sleep, or he dies.

*And the corridor passes.*

It's not about fairness. It's about reality—and facing it. What is, is. We are merely providing an explanation for an existing state.

*What you have become is not a judgment of your soul.*

You may conceptualize it as a mental illness if you wish, if it helps you bear the burden—

Again, your lack of belief in Hell does not matter—

*We do not know what would happen if every human was killed, but this is not an allowable possibility. God could not condone it.*

Yes, if you must put it that way: it is better for you to suffer than for all humanity to end, even if its ending puts an end also to Hell—

You must—

So, even in the face of all we've told you, you choose to die?

*We do not judge you.*

To die by your own hand is your fundamental right.

*As it is our right to prevent you—*

Yes, you're bound.

*We cannot in good faith release you. Not after you have made your suicidal intentions clear to us.*

Understand, we must act in the most ethical way. As a doctor—

*Acceptance is grace.*

You shall barely feel a thing. One needle—followed by paralysis. The body, comatose. Maintained in perfect conditions. A long life—

“Do the comatose dream?”

An excellent question.

*We pray they do not, and that the corridor becomes dormant.*

But we don't know.

*Shh.*

Please—don't struggle...

ShortScaryStories,The Smiley God,"I never thought of myself as superstitious, but even I couldn’t ignore the disappearances in Alswell. Cats, dogs, even birds—all vanished, leaving behind empty dog houses, faint tracks in dead grass, and patches of disturbed soil. Now, my own black kitty, Poe, was gone. He wouldn’t just wander off. A knot of dread told me I had to find him.

Tracking Poe’s path through town felt like following a twisted thread I’d tried to ignore. I’d heard the rumors—unmarked vans circling at night, shadowy figures slipping down alleys, whispers about something called the “Smiley God.” I’d always dismissed it as small-town nonsense. But now, with Poe missing, everything felt too real.

By dusk, I’d wandered to a decaying clearing at the edge of town, where a group of people stood in silence, circling something on the ground. My stomach dropped when I saw Poe, tied up, his eyes wide with terror. Symbols were scratched into the dirt around him, twisting in the fading light.

“Hey!” I shouted, stepping forward. The townsfolk turned to me with vacant stares and eerie, gleeful grins. A woman I recognized spoke, her voice chillingly flat. “The Smiley God requires a shadow—a soul to stitch the veil and brighten its grin.”

“You’re not sacrificing my cat to some… demon,” I spat.

“It’s not just a demon,” she replied, her smile stretching too wide. “The Smiley God keeps a watchful eye over Alswell. A price must be paid.”

They began to chant, moving closer, lifting crude blades above Poe. Just then, I felt something brush my ankle. A larger black cat—its eyes fierce and bright—slipped from the shadows and lunged at the cultists, scattering them in surprise. I didn’t waste a second, grabbing Poe and running for the trees, their furious shouts echoing behind me.

Back at my apartment, I locked the doors and pulled the blinds tight. Poe curled up in my lap, dazed but unharmed. I felt a momentary relief, but sleep wouldn’t come easily. When I finally drifted off, images haunted me: a massive, leering face high in the night sky, grinning down with eyes like hungry emeralds.

I jolted awake to the sound of chanting. Outside, the sky pulsed with a sickly red glow, casting a bloody hue over Alswell. I looked up and saw it—a twisted, monstrous smile in the heavens, its rows of glinting, razor-sharp teeth descending closer, inching down toward the earth.

The ground shook. The cultists were gathered outside, chanting and begging, but it was too late. The Smiley God was ravenous. With an earth-shattering roar, it opened its jaws wide, as wide as the sky itself. I clutched Poe close, feeling a strange, eerie calm as I looked into that endless, grinning void.

And with one final, terrible crunch, Alswell was gone.",25,0.96,2,CityNightcat,2024-11-08 15:11:36,1gmt87k,27,High
ShortScaryStories,Weaponized Incompetence,"“It’s just that… he doesn’t do *anything* anymore. Not like he used to. He just sits on the couch all day and expects me to slave away for him. He doesn’t talk to me anymore. He doesn’t do any chores. I just feel like he’s *using* me, you know?”

My therapist looked over from his desk at me, eyebrows furrowed, and took a long breath.

“I can definitely see the issue here. What you’re describing to me has a name- weaponized incompetence. Your husband is intentionally demonstrating an inability to perform tasks so that you would take on more work for him.”

I slumped in my chair, shaking my head. It was what I expected, however. For the past couple months, James had been refusing to even move from his seat. I had suggested taking couples counselling to see if we could resolve this issue, but he seemed indignant, offended almost, that I had even offered. And so I had been discreetly going to a therapist myself.

“What can I do?” I asked.

My therapist looked at me, his eyes burning into mine, and grabbed my hands. “Listen to me. You need to cut ties. I’ve seen this before. It can’t be fixed. They’ll do anything to stay in this codependent relationship. Leave him. Leave him and *come with me.*”

I took a sharp breath. During these sessions, I had felt an attraction growing towards him, and was certain he felt the same way. And now he was offering a chance to escape? To leave my husband who doesn’t appreciate anything I do?

The answer was clear.

I would go. But there was something I had to do first.

 I spent the car ride home considering what I was going to say to James, justifying my actions and most importantly telling him that I *would* be better off without him.

I opened the door.

“James, I’m home!” I said cheerfully.

Of course, no response.

He was sitting in his usual corner, the television turned onto a static channel, and filth surrounding him. He made no effort to look at me. His head was lolled back and a stream of saliva poured out of his mouth.

“You know,” I said. “You *used* to be perfect. You *used* to love me. Then you had to go and get yourself in that car crash, didn’t you?”

His body started shaking, and incomprehensible mumbles poured out of his mouth. But his eyes, *his eyes* were pleading, begging me to stay. 

Hmmph. I would not fall for his gaslighting, not even now.

“I’ve decided that I will be better of without you.” I continued. “I’ve found someone else. Goodbye, James.”

I turned around and began walking towards the door. His mumbling became louder, almost like a muffled yell. But I didn’t look back. I was warned that toxic partners would try to do *anything* to get you to stay.

Well, you can’t fool me. I walked through the door.

And I was free.",833,1.0,16,ineedabettertitle,2024-11-07 19:29:28,1gm6xqf,849,High
ShortScaryStories,I have a secret.....,"People used to say I had a superpower. Ever since I can remember, I’ve been able to tell if someone has committed murder, directly or indirectly. Even as a five-year old I knew. It didn’t matter how secretive someone was, how well they had covered their tracks. The blood never lied. It stained their hands and arms, dripping slowly down their fingertips. It never dried, never stopped running unless they were caught and stopped. Then it disappeared forever. 

My parents always thought this was just a result of my overactive imagination, until one day my brother died. The day he died my father’s hands dripped crimson. I told my mother but she just smiled sadly, refusing to believe her husband had murdered her son. A year later I was vindicated. I was eight years old when he was convicted and given a life sentence. At that moment I believed my secret could help, could stop crimes like that altogether. How wrong I was.

At fifteen I was helping my local police department track down criminals, and by seventeen I had been offered a spot at the top criminal justice school in the country. I gladly accepted, graduating top of my class in just three years. It was enough to make anyone giddy. I used my newfound knowledge and my special ability to become one of the best private investigators in America. Criminals were caught left and right with me on the job. But today I am writing to inform my clients that I am shutting down my business. I’ve given up. 

At eight years old I wanted to make the world better, but I can’t. Criminals are easy for me to find. Their hands never lie. Unfortunately, I can’t always convict them. I watch as they become celebrities, idols, as they lead nations. I watch as people fawn over them, unaware that these people have slaughtered thousands. The individuals I’m talking about have never killed someone personally, but are indirectly responsible for far more death and destruction than your regular murderer. We are living in the beginning of an apocalypse that I can’t stop. I know that they’ve killed people, but I can’t stop them. I can’t do anything. I am powerless, and I’ve finally decided to accept it. If no one can stop this, soon everyone’s hands will be stained with sticky, crimson **blood**.

ShortScaryStories,"This Day, Last Year","The first notification came on November 3rd: *“This Day, Last Year.”* 

It showed Greg, Tara, and me at the Rusty Nail. Greg had his arm slung over Tara’s shoulder as she laughed, I had the usual look.   

Behind them stood a coat rack, oddly angled, a single dark coat hanging from it.  

November 4th: 

Another notification. Kelsey and Mike were there now. I don't remember them being there.  Mike stood beside Greg, laughing. 

But what caught my eye was me. 

I was standing, animated, smiling, the center of attention. Tara’s hand rested on my arm, her eyes locked onto mine with something like...

No, that’s never how it happens.  

November 7th: 

Tara sat at the table alone, her hands clenched. Greg leaned toward her, speaking, but she wasn’t looking at him. The coat rack now held four coats, sagging and overlapping like slabs of black, brown and beige meat. 

On a hook dangled a brass key, faintly catching the light.  

November 9th: 

My apartment. The coat rack was there behind me. I was at the table, smiling bright at the camera. The key hung from the hook, glinting in the camera flash.  

Today:

I returned to the Rusty Nail. Greg arrived after I texted him. “They’re closing soon. What’s this about?” he asked.  

“Come with me,” I said, leading him to the coat rack.  

Up close, the coats weren’t fabric. They were rough, patchy skin—some pieces hairy, others smooth, stitched together in a haphazard, living patchwork. They formed a heavy curtain around a narrow aperture. Greg flinched at the smell: sour, coppery.  

“What the hell is this?” he breathed out.  

I gestured to the small hole. “Look inside. I already have.”  

He crouched, peering through. Beyond the curtain was a tunnel, its walls fleshy and pink, glistening wet. It pulsed, as though it were breathing. Hooks lined the walls, where scraps of unidentified meat dangle, twitching. The floor looked as soft and slick as the walls and ceiling, cylindrical, as if he were looking through an intestine. At the far end, through another small opening, he saw Tara on her couch, laughing softly at the TV. We both knew where it was: it was the coat rack behind her couch.

Greg turned back to me, his face drained of blood. “Nate, what—”  

I shoved him.  

The hole opened as he hit the curtain, pulling him into the tunnel with a wet squelch. It constricted behind him, returning to its former size.  His fingers poked through, clawing desperately for purchase. I swatted them away playfully, as I slid the key in. His screams erupted before they faded as the lock turned, crushing the bones in his fingers, the tunnel swallowing him completely.  

I tossed the key in the dumpster out back.  

Soon, Tara and I will file a missing person report. She will grieve for a long while, but all wounds heal eventually.

And he'll watch those wounds mend in real-time, as I take what I’ve always wanted.",25,0.9,0,NullVeil,2024-11-08 13:00:26,1gmq6ri,25,High
ProRevenge,"Neighbor was stealing water from my supply, so I ruined him.","I live in Asia, and just purchased a new house. Now, the previous owners were family friends who needed cash urgently and haven't been living in my country for nearly 3 years. So I got it for a great price in the middle of the capital city.

The sale was finalized at the start of this month and I moved in right after. The house was definitely a fixer upper, as the previous owners had left mid renovation and the main door was locked with just a padlock, not even a door lock. 

The house had no gate, meaning anyone could just walk right on in. The first day I moved in, someone's bike was parked in the garage. I just parked it on the road on the same day I had a gate installed. An angry man was knocking on my gate later and I didn't bother answering, but through my window I could see him giving up and taking the bike after 15 minutes. 

So already, I wasn't digging the neighborhood. But I didn't have any incidents after that, aside from people not knowing that this was no longer an abandoned house, so my gate was blocked more often than never but a ""No Parking"" sign on my gate fixed that issue. 

Last week, I was having a shower in my bathroom and I noticed my water pressure was lower than usual. I also heard my next door neighbors water pump going. Now this neighbor, an old guy, lived in a 3 storied house, the first being the lowest and the one he lived in. The other two floors were rented out to tenants. 

This guy wasn't happy about the house being sold, and voiced many concerns to my friends the previous owners. He was super angry about it, and my friends did warn me but I'm a 6ft guy with 3 dogs. No way he was doing anything and yep, he didn't. 

So with this living situation, a water pump is needed to pump water to the tanks on the roof, since the public supply's pressure is not enough to get it up 3 stories. 

Now, I heard the water pump going and immediately was suspicious. Sure, coincidences exist, but it wouldn't hurt to check it out. I waited till his pump turned off, and then turned on different taps in the house. Sure enough, the pressure was back to normal. 

This made me even more suspicious, but if he was stealing water, it also made sense. The water bills had been going up over the years this house wasn't lived in, but the house also had some water leaks. So it was chalked up to that, even if the bills were too high to be caused just by leaks. Now it's starting to make sense. 

At some point in the last 3 years, this old miser thought he'd save the cost of paying for water, and waltzed into the property and is siphoning water from my lines. I couldn't find where exactly he was siphoning water from, but after checking my pressure multiple times, I was pretty sure.

So I sat on it for a few days, thinking if I should confront him, go the legal path or just let it be. Now, water in my country is very cheap. My total bill, even with washing 3 animals, a car every week and watering my garden only cost like $5 per month, even with the neighbor also stealing some of it. 

But it wasn't about how much I was paying or who was paying for it. It's about entitled old people who think that they're deserving of using other people's resources without paying for it, and then getting away with it. It didn't sit right with me, and I really wanted to teach him a lesson. 

What I did was really simple. I just turned off my water from the mains. I wouldn't have to break into his property, nor would I be breaking any laws. It was the best way of getting back at him without needing to even lift a muscle. 

So on Monday, just 4 days ago, I waited till the pump flicked on, and turned off the supply. Now, the way household tanks work in my country, is that there's a ball valve in the tank which detects the level of water and turns on the pump. If the level doesn't increase, the valve stays open which electronically sends a signal to the pump to stay on until the level gets to a point at which the valve closes and also shuts off the pump. 

However, the level wasn't increasing and anyone knows that starving a pump of water isn't a good idea. This way, my expectation was that I'd burn out his pump and cause issues with his tenants. 

What I didn't account for is that his pump running constantly would mess up the fuses by constantly drawing power overnight and absolutely destroy his wiring. If he decided to upgrade his household wiring to a more modern standard, this would've been prevented. This house clearly still had 90s era wiring. 

At around 3AM, I heard all residents in the house waking up and talking in hushed voices about why just their house in the neighborhood doesn't have power or water. I found out about the power part, because the tenants devolved into shouting at their landlord. 

Our tenant protection laws are very important, and power and water are classed as essential even on a state level. Cutting those services are grounds for lawsuits, unless due to weather or some other unavoidable reason. 

In this case, the landlord is responsible for keeping the house wiring up to date and in good condition, alongside the supply of water. So the tenants were not happy and one of them immediately moved out two days later when it was informed that water and power will not be returning the very same day this happened. 

Both tenants in the two floors lodged a complaint with the police, and if a person is in clear breach of laws, the police have the authority to fine or penalize the person without a court judgment. It can be challenged in court if the person thinks that they were unfairly penalized, but they still have to pay the fines and will only be refunded if and when the court finds the fines unlawful.

So now, the landlord lost both tenants and has to pay a fine of $500, which is a lot of money in our country. He also has to refund the security deposits of both tenants, and cannot rent out until both issues are fixed, which will cost him more money. 

As of right now, he's moving out on Sunday to his daughter's place since he cannot afford to live alone. The tenants were his only source of income, and he's a retired mechanic, so he has no other income. 

He did find out why the motor kept drawing power, overloaded the wiring and burned out. He came by to my gate and asked me if I turned off my water, and I said ""oh yeah, my tank had a new leak on a pipe and I turned it off till the next day until the plumber came by to fix the issue"".

Y'all, the look on his face. He kept a straight one, but I just knew he was holding back. He just said ""oh okay"" and went back inside. Not sure if he knows I know, but I don't care because he can't do anything. 

I'm getting a plumber down next week to correct my plumbing and remove any pipes that leave my property. So I got rid of my water issue and a neighbor who could potentially be a pain in the ass, by simply flicking a tap off. Two birds one stone I'd say. 

TLDR: Bought an abandoned house, neighbor was siphoning water from my supply. Turned off my water supply when the motor was running, motor burned out the wiring in the house and cut off water and power to him and his tenants. Tenants lodged police complaints and the landlord got fined, is now destitute and forced to move in with his daughter.",12379,0.96,263,TheMusicFella,2024-11-07 16:15:05,1gm2riq,12642,High
ProRevenge,"If you're gonna steal the catalytics off my truck you should've checked if they were actually functional first, wasn't so funny when it was turn.","Was a fun morning at the beginning of last week starting up my truck and waking everyone up at 2:45am to learn someone swiped the hollowed out cats. The idiots missed the neighbors cameras that basically gave away who they were. Its two kids from the area who drive around in a pretty busted up police crown vic. I chose not to call the cops, instead I called one of my friends who's code enforcement and let him know what my plan was and he relayed the info to the police that I was finally going to do a nuisance tow on that same crown victoria 


The car they drive isnt street legal as it has no license plates or insurance or working taillights and rattles like shit due to the trash sound system they also spend their whole day at a chicken shack smoking. Not sure who theyre getting money from but I'm guessing stealing catalytics was part of the equation. When I spotted the car sitting on a quiet street I called it in and got the go ahead to tow. I took it straight to the police station and they tried to run a owner check with the vin number only to find out it hadn't been registered since 2011 and the owner was someone other than the kids who sold them the car with no title because of all the back registration  owed 


 The cops said we can go ahead and take it to the junkyard til they can get a Black title(aka certificate of destruction). By then the two idiots were running around all over town looking for their car thinking it got stolen by one of their friends as a prank(the key lock was so worn out you could start it with any car key). They found it at the junkyard and tried to steal it by one of them distracting the owner and the other stealing their car but the junkyard was aware of who they were so they cut the driveshaft off beforehand.
 

I missed out on this part but they got arrested for trying to steal their car back and they watched as the junkyard used a crane to rip the car to shreds when I saw it the remains looked like a toddler just ripped it to the bare frame out of curiosity. They been out of jail since but haven't left their trailer, i did a drive by earlier and noticed a beater jeep liberty in their driveway also with no plates and already working with the cops on taking that too if I see it out in a public except I won't miss the show next time.

ProRevenge,Tricking My Slacker Coworker into Sabotaging Himself,"I work in an office with a guy I’ll call “Seth.” Seth is that coworker everyone knows: lazy, always passing his work onto someone else, and somehow always getting away with it. He’ll sit around on his phone or go to the bathroom every 10 minutes. He’s the kind of guy who will show up late, make some lame excuse about traffic, and then disappear for “lunch” for two hours.

For the past six months, Seth’s favorite target has been me. He’ll send emails asking if I can “help out” with a project, but what he really means is, “do all the work while I take the credit.” I complained to my boss a couple of times, but somehow Seth always managed to weasel his way out of trouble. The final straw came when he passed off a major report that was due to a client in two days, dumping it on me last minute.

One day I casually asked him if he was good with Excel, and he admitted he didn’t know much about it. Perfect. The next time Seth tried to dump a bunch of spreadsheets on me to organize for his next report, I agreed. But this time, I embedded a series of *hidden formulas* into the documents. These formulas didn’t do anything important, just enough to mess with the numbers if someone didn’t know how to check for hidden cells. It took me a little time, but I was careful not to make it too obvious. The kicker? Every time Seth tried to copy and paste the data into his report, it would scramble everything just enough to be completely useless.

On the day the report was due, Seth slacked off like usual, assuming I had handled it like always. When the client called, furious because the report was filled with nonsense numbers, Seth panicked. He rushed to fix it, but every time he tried to fix one part of the report, something else would break. He came to me, frantic, and asked for help. I acted confused and said, “Oh, I don’t know what happened! Maybe it’s a glitch?” I gave him some vague advice and watched as he spent the entire day trying to salvage his mess.

Our boss found out, and for once, Seth couldn’t talk his way out of it. He got lambasted for screwing up such an important project and was put on temporary leave without pay. I guess he’ll be doing his own work from now on.",7307,0.96,157,SeagullFanClub,2024-09-24 22:33:14,1fova4p,7464,High
ProRevenge,Oh I played the long game ,"I am by no means an expert, or pro, at revenge but I am a patient person. I disclosed this to a friend and they directed me here. ThrowAway for obvious reasons, it's a long read but the setup and backstory are important.

7 years ago I was lucky enough to be able to buy my own place, I had saved for 10 years, worked my ass off, and I was so happy to be able to have a place to call my own.

Now, being a single person on the mortgage meant I had to make compromises, one such compromise was buying a property on a shared block (a lot cheaper). Where I'm from this usually means it's on a ""strata"" title. For some that's a bonus as it means there's a communal fund for repairs, typically insurance is cheaper as it's collective, and other things like maintenance being taken care of. Strata titles also come with a lot of by-laws and restrictions on what you can and can't do. I'm a pretty private and introverted person so having to deal with people and have limits on how I live was a no-no.

I took my time, found the perfect property. Shared block but freehold title. Only thing that was I needed to pay public liability insurance for the shared walkway on the property (split equally between owners). The real estate agent is local to my area, there's also about 3-degrees of separation between us, he has friends who are friends with my friends type of thing, didn't know him, but knew of him, so that sorta felt good too.

About 5 months after I move in I get a knock on the door from the owner (landlord) of the property next to me to discuss insurance. Not a problem, I ask for a copy of the policy so I have a record. It gets sent through and low and behold it's for strata insurance. I was incredibly confused and after much back and forth the property isn't a free hold title but a strata title. I called my lawyer who conveyed the title etc. He was dumbfounded but over it all did the right thing and made things as right as they could.

I arranged for a meeting with the real estate agent. I brought emails and printouts of the adds they had all saying it was free hold, emails between the real estate agent and my lawyer discussing it's freehold status, despite it being in absolute black and white he refused to accept any fault or offer anything to make things right. I don't begrudge that, he's looking out for himself, I get that. However I wouldn't forget it.

I did enter into mediation with the real estate agent and all I asked for was, when the time came for me to sell, they'd do it or cover the costs. I thought this was reasonable, but they flat out refused offered me 1k to go away, which I refused. I had the option to pursue them legally (and was advised by the mediator to do so) but ultimately I decided against it for a few reasons, the main one being my health at the time.

So I planned and plotted, and I schemed and connived as to how to get back at this son-of-a-bitch. And I settled on this.

I found his personal facebook page which wasn't set to private, saw some photos of a ""Boys on Tour"" trip he went on a few weeks prior (so about 5-6 months after I bought the property). I also found his address through a business registration search. On the anniversary of the sale, for 6 years straight, I sent them flowers with a note :-

""Dear Real Estate Agent  
Remembering you, on this, our special day.  
She has your eyes.  
Love Elle""

They varied ever so slightly over the years but always had ""on this our special day"" and some weird inference to a love child and a desire to reconnect.

I also from time to time arranged for postcards and letters to be sent from another country, the one he was ""On Tour"" in, always signed ""Love Elle"".

I learned about 3 weeks ago that this guy had recently divorced, lost his home and is not longer working as a real estate agent. His wife had found out he cheated on her. The story I was told (through said friends of friends) went along the lines of ""He would get weird gifts and flowers every year, same day, every year. She (his wife) finally put two and two together and realised what the date was and he admitted to cheating on her"".

Now, I didn't mean for this, but it turns out a year before I bought my house he had gone on holiday, came back with an STD, gave it to his wife but somehow convinced her that it wasn't him. As such ""our special day"" turned out to be right around the time he'd have been balls deep, sans condom, in someone who wasn't his wife, only one year earlier. 

He's apparently lost his house, half his retirement savings and also his business. I do feel a little bit guilty about all of it sometimes, but then I'm reminded that he's a scumbag and that Karma, like me, is a patient, spiteful and vengeful bitch.",2372,1.0,66,OnThisOurDay,2024-08-21 07:00:33,1exnr27,2438,High
ProRevenge,"Cable company kept calling to recharge even after disconnecting service, booked tech support to fix non-existent TV box.","This is a repost. Earlier post on r/pettyrevenge got removed. Story is from 2021.

My old TV finally broke down, so I got a new smart tv. Couple weeks later I realized that no one in the family watches any TV channels, everyone goes for streaming content. I decided that it's not worth it to pay for the TV connection anymore. Now, my TV connection is added into my phone plan along with my Internet as well, so disconnecting it was not straight forward. It was a custom plan with its own dedicated relationship team. It took several calls to the team to find a resolution, which was to convert the TV connection to a prepaid one and then stop recharging.

After the conversion was done, I got messages for a few weeks to recharge and then finally a message to return the set top box. I responded to that and in a few days, the box was collected from my place. Good riddance. Or so I thought.

Next started calls from random call centers for recharging. It felt different from the dedicated relationship team. I googled and found out that this had become the practice in my country. The company had outsourced this part of the support to a 3rd party, and they simply checked from the printed database about people who had a connection, but did not recharge last month. Since my disconnection was in the middle of the month, and their printed database was from the beginning, they did not have this updated info.

I tried my best to inform them about this to no avail. I started talking to the callers informing them of the fake problem my TV was having connecting to the set top box and that multiple support requests have fallen on deaf ears. Also started recording the calls. 3rd caller took it seriously and booked tech support. Got a call from a field tech within hours. He came by. I greeted him with drinks and informed him about the real issue. We had a good laugh. He suggested that I keep it up a few more times for good measure.

After 8 tech support visits, finally they got the message. Got a call from a supervisor asking why I was booking tech support when clearly I didn't have a connection anymore. I mailed him the call recordings. He was pretty annoyed. But I stopped getting calls so much. Any call I get now (rarely, like once a couple weeks), I just read from the same script and if someone takes it seriously enough to try to book tech support, they get a short note against my id to not bother this gentleman.",3329,0.97,81,compile_commit,2024-08-09 00:27:56,1enrrhw,3410,High
ProRevenge,We reverse gazumped a greedy landlord and it was glorious.,"“Gazumping occurs when an agent or seller accepts an offer you make to buy a property at an agreed price but the property is sold to someone else. This usually happens when the vendor sells the property for a higher amount.”

This happened 15 years ago and it is one of the proudest moments of my life.
My best friend and her husband have 5 kids together.  They lived in an expensive city and rented an old 4 bedroom house for $400 per week. The house was very rundown with a disgusting kitchen and stink drains but it was all they could afford at the time. Still, they made it work. 
The owner was a nice old lady who as extremely wealthy and very fond of my friend. She froze the rent for 5 years and promised to let them buy the house once they had saved enough to get a loan from the bank. As she had helped other people in a similar way, they knew they could trust her and so they saved every cent they could.
It took them 5 years but they finally told her they were ready..  Two days later, the nice old lady passed away; before anything was put in writing. 😔 

Enter the new owners. The lady’s 4 children. Each extremely wealthy in their own right; they inherited a huge portfolio of properties. When they first spoke to my friends, they assured them that the sale would still go through but they would have to wait until probate had settled. Confident, my friends started making some changes to the place. They started by stripping wallpaper, painting and making plans. Finally probate was settled and the owners agreed to go ahead with the sale for the previously agreed price. My friends applied for the loan but to their shock, it was refused.

The owners had raised the asking price by $80000 without telling my friends. To make things even worse, the house would be put on the open market. In 7 days there would be an Open House and, with the market the way it was, it would probably sell immediately.

My friends were devastated. They might be able to borrow enough but it would take longer than a week to get. To make matters worse, property prices and soared recently and rents had gone up a lot whilst theirs had been frozen.
Not only were my friends going to struggle to get the money. If the place was sold to someone else and they were asked for a higher rent or were evicted, it would be nearly impossible to find an affordable place with more than 2 bedrooms.

I was scared for my friends but I was also incandescently angry.  Those greedy sods were some of the wealthiest people in the city. They were screwing over a struggling family for less than $20000 each. They didn’t need the money. It as pure greed and it was obvious that they’d always planned to do this.

So while my friends scrambled to come up with the money, I started plotting.


I looked up advice on what helps to make a sale. We needed to make the place as undesirable as possible without making my friends look like bad tenants.

Uncluttered: We moved all the furniture in from the walls, added some extra furniture and borrowed ornaments and hung a load of motorcycle memorabilia on the walls. The place felt more smaller.

Smell: My friend boiled a head of cabbage on the stove and we sprayed ammonia around the front and back doors (because it smells like all the neighbourhood cats had been marking their territory). We also poured 2 dozen rotten eggs down the drain to make it smell like sewer gas 🤢.

Neighbourhood: We obtained a mouldy old couch and dumped in front yard of the neighbour across the road (with permission of course).

Neighbourhood x2: We started calling friends for help. Anybody with a loud and crappy car was asked to do a few laps in front of the block during the Open Day. The street was unusually busy that day. Everyone we knew found a reason to drive by. It was practically rush hour.

Neighbourhood x3: We called out mates from the rugby club (full contact football without any of that soft padding). A big portion of our club are very large men. The next door neighbour set up a bbq in their front yard and we offered free food and cheap beer. They came on motorcycles, wearing their roughest gear. There was quite a crowd.

A lot of people showed up for the Open Day. Quite a few were in and out within minutes. One lady sat in her car and watched the party next door before driving away. 
The one bloke who stayed any length time, was brave enough to start up a conversation with someone leaving the party. He asked if they were often there and was told every couple of weeks or so, they have an after party morning and the party the night before was 3 doors up.
The party goer also helpfully mentioned the troublesome drains that are always getting blocked by tree roots and stinking up the place. The potential buyer left without making an offer.

So my friends were the only ones to make an offer. They still had to pay more than they’d planned but not as much as the greed bastards wanted. My friends signed the papers and paid the deposit that day. So when the brave buyer put in an offer of $30000 more than my friends, there was nothing the owners could do about it (strict anti gazumping laws).
I would have loved to see the owners faces when they found out. 😈





For all the people who are saying they had cheap rent. They didn’t. $400 was the rent in 2004 and that was pretty high back then. By the time the lady died, average rent for a house that size had only gone up by about $40. Nowadays, 4 bedroom houses in that area go for approximately $800 per week.",8793,0.94,341,fibeenn,2024-07-30 06:11:15,1efqmr8,9134,High
ProRevenge,"Phone calls for the previous owner, who turned out to be my shitty manager","This is gonna be a long one. TLDR at the end. This could also go in AITA sub. You guys decide. Names have been changed to keep anonymity.

Mobile phones became common in my country around 2004, just as I finished high school. My parents bought me my first phone, a second-hand Nokia. It was bulky and basic, but I promised myself that someday I’d buy a new phone with my own money.

When college started, I had a 2-hour daily commute. In high school, I had excelled academically and won several district-level awards. These awards were being distributed during my first year of college. One nationalized bank award finally gave me enough money for a new phone. I bought a Sony Ericsson K300i and a premium SIM card, not realizing it had been abandoned by its previous owner.

By the third day, I started receiving calls for a guy named Bitsah from various financial institutions. It turned out the number previously belonged to him (and for 20 years, I've been getting these calls). Determined to keep my premium number, I began a routine of blocking wrong numbers. Back then, blocking was device-specific, so each time I got a new phone, I had to start over, keeping a list of numbers to block.

I got my first job after graduating in 2009. Around 2010, I was assigned to a new project with a notorious reputation for burning people out due to a nefarious project manager named Bits. I didn't know his full name for quite a while. He took pride in making our lives a living hell.

Bits ruled with an iron fist. From the moment his team stepped into the office, they were met with a barrage of emails and messages, each more urgent than the last. Bits thrived on creating chaos, often changing project deadlines on a whim, demanding his team work late into the night and through weekends.

Bits’ presence loomed over every task. He insisted on micromanaging every detail, yet was quick to take credit for any successes, no matter how small. Failures, however, were met with his notorious tirades, publicly berating his team and assigning blame without hesitation. His unpredictable temper kept everyone on edge, afraid to make the slightest mistake.

Meetings were another tool in his arsenal of torment. He scheduled them during lunch breaks and after hours, ensuring no one could escape his grasp. These meetings were often pointless, serving only to reinforce his dominance and disrupt any semblance of work-life balance his team might have had.

His relentless stream of emails continued around the clock, each carrying a thinly veiled threat: perfection or dismissal. Under his reign, morale plummeted and burnout soared. Yet Bits remained oblivious, satisfied only by his complete and total control. I was quite ashamed when I learned that he was from the same area as I was and had gone to the same school, though years before me.

In 2012, our company merged with a parent company. Almost nothing changed personnel-wise, but infrastructure-wise we got MS Outlook and an organization view. That was when I first learned about Bits from an organizational hierarchy perspective. His full name was an eye-opener - it was Bitsah.

Now, the name was common enough, but at the time, mobile numbers had an area-specific pattern, so I already knew that the previous owner of my number was from the same area as me. Still, it could be someone else. I wanted to dig deeper.

I talked with an old mentor who lived in the same area and had coached several high-school students for the last two decades. He confirmed my suspicions. I won’t go into the details, but it was evident that Bitsah and Bits were the same person. I had been quite pissed with this unknown person named Bitsah for almost a decade by then, and Bits had been the bane of my (and several others') existence for quite some time.

This is where the revenge lies. First, I unblocked all the numbers in my phone. I was getting 5-6 calls daily on average, but after unblocking about 150 numbers, it increased to 15-18. My answering strategy changed drastically. Instead of saying ""Wrong Number,"" I politely explained that the owner had changed his number and provided his current number to update their database. This is where I could be the AH - I also volunteered his manager's number, in case he tries something else.

The fallout was epic. These people had been trying to find him for almost a decade. Banks had sold his debts to companies that harass people for a living to get their money back. It turned out, he had been taking loans in everyone's names (his wife, parents, uncles, aunts) and giving everyone that same number. He was evading credit card debt and loans of upwards of $200k (equivalent in USD, but it's a shitload of money where we are from). Apparently he had almost 20 cases filed against him, but no one could find him. Probably why he thought he could walk on water.

There are multiple versions of what happened at the office when his manager started to get calls about him. He was let go about 2 months later, haven't heard from him since.

**TLDR**: Previous owner of my number had duped several financial institutions. He later turned out to be my shitty boss. I informed the banks of his new number and his manager's number, leaving his career in shambles.",5418,0.98,144,compile_commit,2024-07-24 05:27:44,1eay1tl,5562,High

ProRevenge,"Fired from my job, but received a years worth of pay and got my Boss fired.","This happened in the early 2010s, before the advancement of technology in video editing and content creation. I was hired as a content creator for a university that wanted to leverage YouTube to kickstart their branding campaign. The pay was low (roughly $2200 USD) and in those days, there were not that many video content creators around and the process usually took a long time from start to finish.

I was hired and on my 2nd day, my manager presented my KPI of 85 3-10 minute videos in 52 weeks which was impossible for a one-man team in those days. This meant I had to do the scripting, producing, casting talents, shooting videos, composing music (they were too cheap to pay for a royalty-free music subscription) and editing - all of which I had to use my own equipment and software because their cameras and computers were so old, they simply couldn't handle the strain of even doing things in 720p, much less 1080p. 

I tried to let my manager know but she just smiled encouragingly, telling me to give it a try, assuring me if the videos were good, the quantity would not be what she focused on. Hearing this, I agreed to give it a try.

My manager treated me well in the first month, however, one day when she found out I was a smoker, her attitude changed overnight. A colleague had actually done a facepalm when I told her about it and she let me know that the manager hated smokers and often advocated to get them fired. She started nitpicking me on everything, from smelling like cigarette smoke after my breaks, coming in 5-10 minutes late despite doing more than 4 hours of overtime daily, not being contactable during break times...the list goes on. But I soldiered on, because I just wanted to do the work and do it well.

5 months in, I was called into the Director's office where I saw my manager putting on her best ""displeased but gleeful face"" and I felt my stomach drop.

The director told me that she was disappointed because she had heard that I was falling behind on my work, and it was already halfway through the year and I had only completed 30 out of my 85 videos.  I tried to explain that I had been working my butt off on these videos, I literally worked 6 days out of the week, over 60 hours just to do what needed to be done and that being a 1 man army made things impossible, and also the fact that the videos I had put up grossed the highest views ever on their YouTube page. I also recounted how my manager said that she was looking for quality videos over quantity.

The director dismissed this and stated that the KPI was simply 85 videos in a year and since it was almost half a year in with my numbers at less than half, she felt it prudent to cut the cord early. I asked how would they even meet the KPI if they were to fire me now my manager had snorted, saying ""We'll find a PROFESSIONAL production house to finish your work."" The director had given her an odd look but nodded in her support nonetheless, telling me ""You don't need to worry, Manager will get the job done."" That was when a lightbulb went off in my head. 

Seeing as I was the content professional in the office, one of my jobs was to keep a database of production houses to use in the event we needed to do a shoot that required more resources, and I was sure that they would be using the production houses in my database as my manager had no contacts in the production industry. So, I changed the contact numbers and messed up all the emails on all of the entries except ONE. The one, I had a friend working as a junior director (not an assistant director, but a director assigned to smaller video projects). I gave him a call and told him of my plan, and sure enough within 2 days, they were called to come in to pitch.

I told him that I had a plan that was a win-win for us. It would instantly help him and put him on the fast track to a director position by bringing in that much business to his production house and it would also benefit me financially. I would teach him exactly how to pitch to win over the boss and the director and in turn, his company would pay me a standard finders fee of 15%. He agreed instantly and immediately put me on the line with his general manager who upon realizing this was to be 6 months of work for a high 6-digit payout, instantly agreed and drew up a contract.

As it turns out, after I gave them a metaphorical ""step-by-step playbook"" they were the ""perfect fit"", somehow understanding the needs and style of the university as well as the sort of themes the university wanted to feature. The director and my former boss were amazed that my friend's production house was so familiar with their content that they signed them up on the spot. 

Now, even back then using a production house back then was not cheap. Each video that they produced could cost double to triple my monthly salary given that they had specialized people for each function (Producer, Director, Director of Photography, Gaffer, Sound person, Video Editor, Assistant Director, Production Assistants etc), but this meant that they could complete a video every 2-3 days.

So yes, they produced 50 videos in a span of 4 months for over 100 months of my salary and I sat back and collected the healthy 15% which was about 15 months of my salary. This allowed me to put money aside for a holiday and the rest to further my studies with a respected film school overseas. I thought my plan ended here and I had gotten back at my former bosses, but to my surprise, I received a call from my colleague while I was holidaying in Bali one day. This was the same colleague who had facepalmed when I told her that my manager had found out that I was a smoker.

She told me that my former manager had been FIRED and my director given a massive blasting by the Chancellor of the University. The content creation project which I was hired for was only given a budget equating to about a year and a half of my salary and they had exceeded that budget by over 10 TIMES. My former manager was so desperate to ensure that her content creation project could be completed that she had thrown caution to the wind, paying anything to get the job done so that she could show my director that she had completed the project, and had approved the massive spend without getting consent from the director.

So that is how I got my friend a super fast promotion to a full Director in his production house, and a year of pay after getting unfairly fired from my job.

ProRevenge,401k With A Side Of Revenge ,"Someone suggested I post this story over here… enjoy! 

When our first child was born, my ex forced me to quit my job. When our 2nd child was 2, I found out about his affair. By then he was extremely verbally, emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. When he abused our first born, I put him out. That was in 2012.

I couldn’t afford daycare to work and had no family support. He refused to give me any money to take care of the kids saying “The courts haven’t ordered me to give you a dime!” He lied to the bank and had my accounts frozen and even assaulted me when I filed for default in the divorce. 

The judge finally ordered him to pay child and spousal support 6 months after I kicked him out. It was 2562 a month. He refused to pay it until the garnishment kicked in and by then he was 6k behind in support. I used that to get permission to move away. 

I remarried a year after the divorce. I checked the court docs and there was a little box that said spousal support stopped upon remarriage if that box was checked. It wasn’t checked, so I figured I was good. Instead of filing for his retirement, I just took that year of spousal support (12k) and left it alone. (Spousal support was only ordered for 2 years) 

In 2017, he filed for sole custody of the kids out of nowhere. That was when he found out I had remarried and he had paid spousal support to me during the first year of my marriage. I told him I took that money instead of filing for my share of his retirement. I said if he let me keep that 12k, I wouldn’t file to split his 401k. He demanded that I repay the spousal support. The judge ordered me to repay it but increased child support and deducted the repayment from that. It ended up that I got an extra 20.00 a month and he repaid himself. He dropped his bid for custody in exchange for 2 extra weeks in summer. 

I pursued the retirement account split. He refused to cooperate and dragged it out for 4 years. It was so bad, they sanctioned him and he had to pay me 600 a month for a year in addition to child support. They also charged him with contempt. 

In Jan 2021, he proposed to his girlfriend. In May of 2021, I finally got the disbursement from his 401k. I won’t say how much it was, but it was about 4 times the amount of spousal support overpayment. I had no idea it would be that much. I had thought it would be around 12k which is why I thought keeping that year of spousal and not filing for his retirement account was a fair trade. Had he not tried to take the kids from me, I never would’ve filed to split the account. Play stupid games… win stupid prizes. 

His fiancé emailed me recently and told me it is my fault he won’t marry her because I cleaned out his retirement account. She said I shouldn’t have “stolen” his money. I told her that I gave him the option to let me keep that year of spousal support or take it back and I could file for his retirement. He chose to have me file for his retirement. I told her that if he really wanted to marry her and protect his assets, they could get a pre-nup so he wouldn’t have to worry about it. She said she shouldn’t have to sign a pre-nup because I “robbed” him. 

I never asked to be financially dependent on him. He clearly indicated he wanted a court order to take care of his kids so I got him one. I tried to be fair and take the lesser amount by taking the spousal support and not filing for his retirement. He wouldn’t let me. 

In summary, my ex refused to pay me until support orders dropped, refused to pay until they revoked his license. Tried to get me in trouble for accepting spousal support over payment and in the end it cost him a lot of money out of his 401k.

Stole my dryer and other household products that are in a common area.
Made me pay for a plumbing repair which was deemed normal wear and tear. 
Tried breaking into my house. 
Retaliated against me because I went to my lawyer after he sent me a letter about a parking spot. He tried charging me an extra $150/month. 

Mind you, I was never late for rent in 3 years, except for when he made me pay for the plumbing repair. So the next month I was a couple days late. 

The list goes on...Now this apartment was no where near nice. I found out the plumbing was illegal, he left me with a porch for years that has severe safety issues, the ceiling paint was always falling down, gas heater was not up to code, and so on. 

I finally got my chance to leave after he wanted to raise my rent $500/month. He will do anything, and everything to get more money out of his tenants. 

So I called the building inspector 4 days before I left. I told him everything. The porch when he finally replaced it didn't have a permit and was definitely not up to code. I told him about the plumbing and the heater. I went on and on. The inspector came over the very next day, I saw him taking measurements. Each violation is a $500/day fine until fixed. I honestly don't know what happened, but my God did it feel good to finally get him back. He's at the very least on the town's radar. 

A week before I moved out he tried telling me I needed to be out at a specific time.  I never responded and where I lived, that's not how it works.  He tried to threaten me with the police if I wasn't gone. Well, I went to the police myself that morning to warn them. The landlord did come by, threaten me and harass me. I called the police, they informed him I was in the right.

Long story short, he had broken into my apartment (I had left to go to storage) while I was gone.  He nailed my door shut. I told the police to get the supervisor because I was over being harassed by this guy.  Go figure he left before the supervisor could get there. I'm positive he knew he'd be arrested on site. 

Got the police report, they're charging him with a felony for breaking and entering.

Fines plus a charge? Don't be a jerk to good people.

ProRevenge,"My landlord got not *exactly* what he deserved, but it sure was a rough ride for him.","i had a landlord who was pretty absent. i lived in this building (a high rise, like 20 stories) for 10+ years. he, despite living next door to me, was absent and cold personally but cool enough. rent was good, our agreement was NEVER bother him about anything unless its an absolute emergency.

shower head wonky? go buy a new one. fridge breaks? get it fixed, or dude just buy a new one. take it out of what you pay in rent. lost the receipt i DONT CARE i know more or less what a fridge costs just take it out of rent

finally his wife decides she wants more rent, wants to rent the place out as an office (not legal) and wants us out asap. i agree to move out a month early and get a month's rent back + deposit.

complete 180 on their part. ""the place is ruined, can't give you shit until you fix all this stuff"". 2 main things: my cats did scratch up the leather legs of the dining table, and the pull-up bar made 2 dents in the door frame of the kitchen, which was quite nice hardwood. they come to me with this list of TONS of stuff like oh you hang a photo frame here, this tile is slightly chipped.

this is the busiest work time of the year for me but im trying to be cooperative, sure, i got the table legs re-leathered, spackle the photo frame wall hole. can't do anything about the door frame, take it out of deposit. patch the tile. like dozens of little everyday-wear-and-tear things, like you want me to change the window screens? these are all new screens and in nicer shape than when i moved in! but i did them all, i trusted the guy. gotta get my money

at the end he should have been giving me 24k rmb (~£2500). he gave me FIVE. ""i still need to use the money to fix all that stuff, if you can't accept the five, i can't give you anything at all."" i was super pissed off but took the five.

now, people in the building are gossipy. i dont participate but i did tell this one older lady about my frustration. she told EVERYONE. the wife went from being the star of the ""mommies group"" of the building to nobody wanting to talk to her. people shunned the guy, too. i originally told them i was planning on moving to another city but an opportunity came up and i ended up renting a similar unit in the same building. so they thought they could just screw me over and not have to see me, but now they still did. often.

a year later the office calls me with some question about how to do something with the floor heating, i go... door frame is not fixed, still has dents, i call the guy like ""what the hell, man"" and he tells me to mind my own business

5 years later... i see the light at my old place is still on at 3am. huh, that's odd. i go to check, the door is open, and the place is just trashed, ruined. cabinets broken, stuff on the walls ""lazy landlord""... and the dents on the kitchen door frame are still there. so the guy never fixed anything, just kept my money

by this time smartphones were popular and we had a chat group for the whole building, so about 500 people. i took pictures and posted everything. apparently he had also nicked these peoples deposit, and there was a huge ruckus when they trashed the place, cops called. all these people chime in with complaints, and pictures. people smoking in the hallways, leaving leaky rubbish outside the front door, videos of people using foul language in front of children, dirty footprints.

he got fined a lot for 1: creating a public disturbance 2: degrading the quality of the living space 3: illegally renting a residence as an office and to top it off the building management wouldn't grant him permission to have workers in to fix the place, so it sat there empty for like 6 months. the fines were big, too.

take ~1.5 month's rent from me, lose a year's rent. suck it, bro.",3673,0.95,64,redditsavedmyagain,2024-05-02 21:11:07,1cixe6i,3737,High
ProRevenge,Got rude guy arrested for suspended license. ,"This story takes place about 20 years ago. 

In the mid 2000s my friends and I would frequent a small billiards place in a neighboring town where you could rent a table by the hour or play per game.  We’d play a few games, watch whatever sports were on TV, and have casual conversations. There were no problems and no drama until about 3 months of us visiting this place. 

A guy shows and takes our spot at the billiards table. No big deal. We were all chatting anyway. 20 min later my friend lets him know we want to play next game and the jerk is super dismissive. 

Needless to say, we didn’t get in during the next game. So I politely let him know we wanted to play next. Another lady chimed in she wanted the game after us. The guy blatantly ignored me and the other woman. 

Some more time going by and the guy leave the table. We see our chance to get in. We put the quarters in and the balls are dispensed- except the green “6” ball. The guy took it to the bathroom with him. 

At this point it was ridiculous and we notified the manager. The manager noted it was 12:30 and they were going to be calling last call and closing so he didn’t want to make a scene by kicking him out. He gets us another ball so we can play. 

The guy comes out of the bathroom and knows we realized what he did. He smirks and proceeds to the  patio to have a cigarette, bringing along his beer and the green billiard ball. 

The guy comes back in and tossed the ball he was holding onto the table hitting a few balls on the table and messing up our game. He goes up to the bar just in time for last call. 

One of the friends I was with suggested we follow him home and each call the highway patrol to report a suspected drunk driver. 3 of 4 of us agree. So when he leaves we used our trusty Nextel push-to-talk phones and coordinated several calls to the police. We provided details like license plate, vehicle make and model and color, and mentioned the car nearly hit another vehicle, was swerving between lines and driving erratically. This was under a 15 minute plan. We had no idea where the guy lived but suspected it was close as he was visiting a neighborhood place so our time was limited. 

The one guy who didn’t notify the police tailed the jerk and called us giddy when a police officer pulled between him and the guy and turned in his lights to pull him over. The police blotter that week included an arrested of a guy who was pulled over after multiple calls of erratic driving. He wasn’t arrested for DWI but instead for driving on a suspended license. 

TLDR: guy was a jerk at a local billiards club so we got him pulled over by the cops and he was arrested for driving in a suspended license.

ProRevenge,A lawyer's pro revenge on a landlord,"Landlords are assholes, generally speaking.  Everyone knows that. But if you think residential landlords are bad, they’re nothing compared to commercial landlords.  Landlords of commercial buildings are some of the cruelest, nastiest people I’ve ever come across.  This revenge tale is about a commercial landlord, and how I dealt with him.

Back in the 90s, sometimes I’d go for lunch at this restaurant in the basement of our building.  The place was called “The Vault”, because it had a massive bank vault that had always been there, dating back to the days before the place was turned into a restaurant.  The vault was so huge that they could seat a couple of tables in there, and you could eat dinner surrounded by rows of old, gleaming safe deposit boxes.  One day I was there for lunch, and the owner took me aside.

“The landlord’s driving me nuts,” he said.

“The landlord drives everyone nuts,” I said.

I was a subtenant in the same building, sharing space with an older lawyer, Aaron, and the landlord was always causing us trouble.  I’d already had a few run-ins with him, and we hated each other on sight.  

In most jurisdictions, commercial landlords don’t need court orders to get you out if you're late with the rent.  Instead, they just change the locks, and you find out about it when you show up and your key doesn’t work.  Every time our landlord had a dispute with anyone, which was often, he’d always threaten to change the locks.

“He keeps demanding all this stuff for extra rent,” the Vault’s owner said, “and it’s really weird, because a lot of it’s really old.” The restaurant owner showed me a letter the landlord had served on him earlier that day.  I looked over the demand, and read a list of expenses for snow removal and parking lot repair and common area flooring and all kinds of crap going back years.   I read it all the way to the end, and there it was, the usual clause saying he was going to change the locks if the tenant didn’t pay this and do that.

“From the wording of the demand, it looks like you’ve been fighting a while.  Why did you wait before consulting a lawyer?”

“I asked one of the lawyers I know, and he said it’s hopeless.”  He told me the lawyer’s name.  It was a guy I knew with a shitty real estate practice, who’d resorted to taking little legal aid cases to keep the lights on when the market tanked in ‘89.

“You do something to make the landlord hate you?” I asked, “because this is a bit over the top, even for our asshole landlord.”

“He knows I’m moving the restaurant.  I think he’s trying to grab as much money as possible before I go.  Plus he’s giving me grief over the vault.”

“He won’t let you take it with you?”

“Are you kidding?  It weighs almost a hundred tons, and I don’t need it.  But the lease says I have to remove it, and that I also have to restore the building to what it was before there was a vault.  That would cost a fortune.  The asshole landlord says if I leave the vault behind when I move, he’ll sue.”

“Send your lease up to my office, and let me look it over,” I said.  I finished my lunch, and when I got back to my office the lease was waiting for me.

It was just as bad as the restaurant owner said.  The lease was a renewal of a renewal of an assignment of a renewal,  the original documents dating back to the shortly after W.W.II when a bank first leased the place and the vault was installed. Somehow the landlord had suckered the restaurant into taking over a lease that left him liable to remove a bank vault at the end of term.

“No big deal,” I thought, “the restaurant can default, and all the landlord can do is sue a shell company.”  But when I got to the last page of the lease, there was a guarantee clause.  The restaurant owner had personally guaranteed the lease, and he was on the hook for removing a vault weighing a hundred tons, and then fixing the place up.  It would cost a fortune.

The case was hopeless, of course; that was obvious right away.  But then I thought about the asshole landlord with his demands and his threats and his rent hikes, and I asked my brain to do me a solid, which it promptly did.  I picked up the phone and called the restaurant owner.

“I’m fucked, right?” he said, “You’re calling me to say there’s no way out.  That’s what my commercial lawyer already said.  But I just thought I’d ask.”

“I can save you, but it’s gonna cost.”

“How much?”

“Five thousand in legals, and another G-note for the agent.”

“Agent?  What kind of agent?”,

“Real estate.  Send up a cheque, certified, and leave the rest to me.”  The cheque hit my desk in less than an hour.  I went to Aaron’s office.  “I need a real estate agent,” I said.

“You buying a house?”

“Nope.”

“Selling a house?”

“Nope.”

By this point I’d been sharing space with Aaron for almost five years, and he knew me pretty well.  “You pulling one of your stunts again?” he asked.

“Yup. But nothing that will get you into trouble.”

“I know a guy,” he said.  

Aaron knew all kinds of guys, and that’s one of the reasons he eventually got disbarred.  But he knew a guy, and he gave me the agent’s name and  number, and the next day I paid the agent a visit. I told him what I needed, and we agreed to terms.  I gave him some papers and the cash for his fee.

A few days later I was again at The Vault for lunch.  The owner saw me walk in, and greeted me himself.

“The landlord’s here,” he said.

“Why?”

“For lunch, and to be an asshole.  Let’s sit in the vault room so I don’t have to look at his face.”  He took me to the vault room, and with the door almost completely closed, we had a consultation while we ate pasta and drank red wine.

“We’re making demand on the landlord,” I said, between bites of a perfect carbonara.

“Demand?  What are we demanding?”

I pulled a document out of my briefcase and passed it to him while I sipped my wine.  “We’re demanding that the asshole landlord release all the restaurant equipment, all the fixtures.  The ovens, the freezers, the ventilation:  everything you need to run a restaurant.”

“The lease exempts all that stuff,” the restaurant guy told me, “He can’t stop me taking what I want. The only thing that matters is the vault, and of course I don’t want that.”  I shook my head.

“You need the vault,” I said “and we’re demanding that he release the bank vault as well.  We’re insisting that he let you take it out within seven business days.”

“You think you can beat the landlord with reverse psychology?  You think if you treat him like a two-year old, you can manipulate him into doing what you want?”

“We’ll find out soon enough.  He’s had the demand for a couple of days now.”

The restaurant owner dropped his wine glass and it shattered on the marble floor.  “You already gave it to him?” the restaurant owner said.  He got up, swung open the vault door and called for the waiter to clean up the mess.

“Let’s see what the landlord has to say,” I told him, and we walked over to the landlord’s table.  The landlord was a big, beefy man with a big appetite.  He sat alone, eating a rack of lamb wolfishly with his hands.

“My client needs an answer today,” I said.  The landlord looked up at me as he chewed noisily.   “I’m The Vault’s lawyer,” I said.  “I gave you a demand the other day.  My client needs an answer right now.  He needs the vault for a new place, and he’s got to make arrangements.”

“Your client can forget about the bank vault,” he said, wiping his massive greasy hands on an already soiled napkin.

“But you can’t do that,” I said.  My shock was feigned, but the restaurant owner’s jaw dropped for real.

The landlord laughed at us. “I’m the landlord.  I can do what I want.”

“I’m gonna need that in writing, because my client might sue.” I said.

“Sue all you like,” the landlord told me, “sue ‘till you’re blue in the face.”   He told me that I’d have a formal response by day’s end, and then he told me to go away and let him finish his lunch.  When the letter arrived from the landlord, claiming ownership over the bank vault, I brought it downstairs and showed it to my client.

“How the hell did you do that?”

“Trade secret,” I said.

The following month the restaurant moved out and the place was empty, and that was too bad, because I had always liked eating at the Vault.  Now the restaurant was in a new location twenty minutes away.  They called the new place “The Vault,” and they’d preserved the vibe of the old place.  It was very similar, except they didn't have the bank vault.  The bank vault, all one hundred tons of it, was where it had always been, in the basement of the building where I rented space.   I showed up for work a little after that, and Aaron collared me.

“The landlord’s looking for you,” he said.

“Oh yeah?  What about?”

“He’s really angry. He said his deal fell through.”

“Deal?”

“He was supposed to rent the place downstairs to a new tenant, a bank  or a credit union or something like that.  They were supposed to come in to sign a lease, but they didn’t show up.”

“And what’s that got to do with me?” I said to Aaron, and  I said the same thing again to the landlord when he managed to track me down a couple of days later.

“I know you were behind this,” he said, his jowls quivering, “I know it was you.  That offer from the agent, it was all bullshit.  Just a trick to make me keep the vault, so that your client could sneak out of the place and leave that fucking bank vault behind.  I’m gonna sue.”

“If you’re looking for counsel, I think I’m going to have to declare a conflict.”

“I’m gonna sue the restaurant, and that agent, and I’m gonna sue you.”  He stormed off.

But the landlord didn’t sue.  Of course he didn’t.  He didn’t have a contract to sue on, only a vague letter of intent that I’d drafted, enough to hook a greedy landlord who was used to having his way.  The offer he’d received was non-binding, incapable of acceptance without the signing of a formal lease, which of course never got signed.

When I left Aaron’s place a year later, the downstairs was still unoccupied, with a sad ‘for rent’ sign sitting in the window, starting to look faded.",5970,0.95,285,Calledinthe90s,2024-04-11 15:40:08,1c1pnev,6255,High
ProRevenge,Steal furniture? Almost lose your job,"So my dad owns a house that he's been renting for some time now. The tenants that lived there were for the most part decent people who my dad thought were trustworthy.

That all changed about 2 months into the tenancy when the the tenant refused to pay the month's rent. My dad showed some leniency and gave them another month to pay up what was owed, they didn't pay a thing.

By this point, my dad frustrated by the whole situation and being two months out of rent money offered them a deal. Leave the house ASAP and then only pay half the money owed, they countered with a different agreement, they would leave the house in a clean state with all of their furniture left behind as compensation.

My dad, wanting to just be done with them, agreed. Queue to when my dad gets to the house, finding the place in a mess, with NONE of the furniture left behind, including the furniture that belonged to my dad in the first place. The two sofas that my dad owned were left behind, but they were trashed and left in the shed.

When my dad confronted them asking for them to pay up the full amount that the furniture was worth, he was met with a promise of ""payment after two weeks"" which he didn't believe and when he requested they pay earlier he was met with ""Good luck getting your money"" followed by laughing emojis.

This made my dad angry and he decided that he wasn't going to let this slide.

My dad knew that the tenant was a christian pastor of a church, and his son also had some job related to the church. My dad contacted the church and explained everything from how they hadn't paid him rent money to stealing the furniture and trashing the place. The church was somewhat interested about this behaviour. 

The next day, my dad gets an angry phone call from the tenant's son cursing at him and asking him what he thought he was doing contacting the church saying he was being 'unfair'. My dad hung up on him only for him to attempt to ring 10 times after he hung up. From what we could piece together, the church had told the pastor that if he didn't settle things with my dad, him and his son would lose their jobs.

My dad received the full amount for the furniture that same day and agreed to back off. My dad later said, it was never about the money but the way this guy treated him and his values (my dad being a christian himself was disappointed)",3083,0.97,96,ExaminationFun619,2024-04-09 07:22:27,1bzqt61,3179,High
ProRevenge,Threaten my friend with revenge porn? I'll ruin your whole damn life.,"My very good friend made...some slightly dumb mistakes and sent some pictures to someone that she reasonably thought she could trust, but not knowing much more than than his first name, his screen name, and roughly where he lived and the type of work he did.  He is not in our country but had indicated that he would be traveling for work to near us shortly, and they had made some plans to meet.

And when she got some red flags and backed out, the dude threatened to publish these pictures online.

I am, incidentally, an attorney.

So, some searching later, and gathering up any pictures he sent her of him, that could possibly identify him, his online handle let me to a TikTok page, which lead me to an instagram page with his name on it.

That lead to a linkedin page with his place of work that matched a picture he sent with a branded polo he was wearing.

Some more searched got me the email of the CEO, VP of HR, operations manager, and public relations manager.

I just fired off an email on behalf of *my client* of the screenshots of him threatening revenge porn, snippets of the conversation showing that username while he sent that exact picture of him wearing his company's branded apparel, links to how I know it's him, along with pictures he sent her of his motorcycle with the license plate showing, as further proof it is him.  I also included screenshots of him discussing a workplace incident that were time stamped, along with pieces of dialogue discussing how he had sex with an ex at his place of work, and discussing plans to have sex with her in his office as well.

I also included a picture he sent her showing his work laptop with his entire outlook calendar, along with proprietary information (which he sent to ""prove he was busy"") along with other pictures he took of his workplace with non-consenting employees.

I further informed his employer that I will be forwarding all this information to local (to them) law enforcement and since he had indicated that he would be traveling to the United States soon, will also forward this to the local office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as, since *my client* is a US citizen on US soil, these threats constituted a federal crime.  So that should they continue with his employment, and continue with their plans to send him to the United State for work, I will ensure, on behalf of *my client* that federal law enforcement is waiting for him on arrival.  Which I will do, as one of the assistant US attorney's for this region is a law school buddy of mine.  

Since I have his license plate # I know where he lives, and will be contacting his local authorities tomorow.

ProRevenge,Not going to pay overtime? Think again.,"TL:DR Don’t mess with the IT guy.  

I was discussing this sub with a good friend, and he said, “Boy, have I got a story that’ll fit.” It wasn’t his story, but his brother’s, and I sat with him and got the details. Buckle up, it’s a good one…and a long one.  

Let’s call him “Bob”. Bob has been fiddling with computers since he was a kid, and knows them pretty well. As with most IT people, he’s moved from job to job. The employer he worked for was a service/distribution company, and there were two IT employees. The company was located in Ontario, Canada.  

About three years ago, Bob’s employer decided to modernize their software. They had separate programs for Dispatching, for Inventory, for Payroll and Finances, and it was complicated moving information from one program to the other. They decided to get an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) program, and Bob recommended one that he knew inside-out from a previous employer.  

For those of you who don’t know, an ERP program handles everything. Purchase orders. Sales. Inventory. Personnel. Vendors. Customers. All of it. You can run a report and find out which customer has bought the most Part ABC in the last year. Which salesman has improved his numbers the most. Which vendor has the fastest delivery time. Which shipper packed the most orders.  

Everyone in the company used the ERP program, but it was very complicated, and they used the aspects of it that related to their position. For example, the Receiver would accept a shipment, verify the quantity, confirm it was received…and the inventory stats would be available to the Sales people if they wanted to look up how many were on hand. The Receiver didn’t care what the price was, or who the vendor was, he just did his job.  

Bob was run ragged during the implementation process, but he managed to train most of the employees on their aspects, and after a few months, everything was running fairly smoothly. Bob still got tickets for tweaks in the operation of the software, and occasional hardware IT issues.  

Then the company decided to expand their footprint and was marketing into different time zones.  

That messed things up. Atlantic Canada is 90 minutes early, so if someone sent an email or an order at 8am their time, it would arrive at 6:30am Ontario time. Pacific Canada is 3 hours late….so an email sent at 3pm Vancouver time would arrive at 6pm. This stretched out the day, so many staff came in early and worked late.  

Bob would arrive at 8am and there would be people that demanded his immediate assistance, and were annoyed that he didn’t respond instantly, even though their request was submitted before his start time. Same with late in the day…his phone would ring at dinnertime with people that wanted help right now.  

They decided to stagger his and his IT colleague’s shift times, Bob would start at 6am and work till 2:30, and his colleague would start at 10:30am and work till 7pm. Bob’s colleague had kids, and refused the shift change. The employer insisted. The colleague quit.  

That meant that Bob was the only person in the IT department. The employer said they would look to hire a new IT guy, but they had trouble finding one that knew the ERP system….and they were offering well under a market value salary.  

Bob asked for a raise and was denied. Then he wanted overtime, and the employer told him that as an IT specialist, he was exempt from overtime laws in Ontario. Bob looked it up, and the employer was correct. This went on for some time, and he knew lots of IT people socially. They told him what the company was offering, and Bob know that they wouldn’t find another tech.  

Things went downhill from there. Bob would get chewed out if he missed a call or an email, no matter what time it came in. He had to train new hires in the ERP system, as well as take care of the hardware. He asked repeatedly for better compensation, and was denied….so he planned to get a new job.  

Now here’s the revenge. Bob had access to the entirety of the ERP program. When a user signed in, the time was logged, and even if they didn’t sign out, after 15 minutes it would log them out anyway. Everyone in the company was on salary, and many of them came in early and stayed late. Ontario labour law states that even salaried workers are entitled to overtime after 44 hours a week, unless they were Managers or Supervisors.  

So Bob jumped into the program and ran a report for each employee that wasn’t a Manager. All the way back to when the ERP program was started. Then he reached out to an employment lawyer and got the okay to refer employees to him.  

Bob lined up another job, and after he left, every employee in the company got an email with an Excel sheet showing the hours they had put in past 44 hours a week. The subject line said “You’re Legally Entitled to Overtime Pay” In the body of the email was the lawyer’s name.  

The shit hit the fan. Almost every employee authorized the lawyer to negotiate with the company on their behalf, and the company had to pay a ton of money.  

All the company had to do was pay Bob for the extra work he put in. Instead, they had to pay almost everyone.",3241,0.99,118,PJMurphy,2024-04-01 21:36:12,1btnlw4,3359,High
ProRevenge,I ruined my ex-boyfriend’s life 20+ years ago and I just made sure it stayed ruined,"Sorry this is a bit long.  All names changed.  Throw away account for all the reasons.

When I was in college in the 90s, I met “Jake” (then M23) through mutual friends.  He had already graduated and was planning to move to the opposite side of the United States for grad school and I had already been making plans to move with friends only a 90 minute drive away from where he was moving to.  We had so much in common, fell in love and it really seemed like fate, both planning to move 3000 miles and landing so close together.  He had two sisters and a younger brother who were all awesome people and I became instant friends with them as well.    
  
Because he was in school and I was working, I would usually go to him to hang out on weekends.  He was renting a house with 2 roommates, also in his program.  We were young so money was tight but we had fun, went for taco dates and spent a lot of time at his house where he was breeding and selling small animals.  Jake was an animal sciences PhD student so being around animals was normal and I loved it.  I met and became friends with his advisor’s wife (“Mary, F mid-50s) who worked in administration at the university.  She is a lovely woman and I would often have lunch with her when I went over on weekends.  Jake was a teaching assistant (TA) and I met other people in the program and made friends with them faster than he did.    
  
After about 2 years of dating, I was at the house one day, laying in bed together, in a state of some undress and he said out of the blue, he was concerned I’d been gaining weight and it made it harder for him to be attracted to me.  No concern about my health, it was all about him finding me unattractive.  I sat up and said, well, then maybe you should make sure there is better food for me to eat than crackers and cheese when I come up on weekends.  Even at 23, I didn’t take that kind of BS.  I had gained MAYBE 10 pounds since meeting him two years earlier and still wore the same size clothes (about a US size 6-8).  I wasn’t going to engage in a fight about it after all, it was his problem, not mine, so I asked him calmly, so what is your solution to this?  He stared at me blankly and said well, I guess that you should try to lose weight and I said, nah, I’m not going to do that so what are YOU going to do about it.  He said, well, I guess nothing, I wanted to let you know how I feel and I said, cool, thank you, put my clothes back on, went to sleep and drove home the next day as usual.    
  
We keep dating and about 3 months later he called me and said he wanted to break up after close to 3 years.  The reason AND I QUOTE “You don’t know enough about science”.  He felt like he couldn’t have a conversation with me about his work where he didn’t have to use common names for animals instead of scientific ones.  I said, well, that’s bullshit, what’s the real reason.  He said it was the real reason.  He came to see me a month later to return something of mine and I confronted him, demanding the real reason.  He finally admitted he had been seeing one of his undergrad students, let’s call her Meg, a 19 year old.  He was then 26 and her teacher.  I screamed at him to leave, my roommate threated to throw him off our second floor balcony if he didn’t go and he left.  It hit me all at once after he walked out and I went from rage to stunned laughter.  I’d met Meg a few times and at one point, she was at his house for a BBQ and spilled something all over her pants.  Jake asked me if I could loan her some sweats.  I couldn’t because I was a size 8 and she was a size 18.  Nothing wrong with that, AT ALL, but the point is, I realized he made those comments about my weight to try and get me to break up with HIM because he was a coward.  He clearly liked a big gal.  Although, when he’d said those things to me about my weight it was 1am, I lived about 95 miles away and we had just had sex so I don’t know how he thought this would go, even in hindsight, it’s perplexes me.  Did he think I was going to break up with him and storm off into the night and drive for an hour and a half?    
  
ANYWAY, I emailed his roommates, it was the early 2000s, it’s how you communicated anything you didn’t want to say on the phone. I wanted to let them know we'd broken up and that they were always lovely to me and thanked them for being friends.  They both admitted they knew about Meg and were the ones to demand that Jake tell me or they would.  That’s when he broke up with me with the lame, you don’t understand science excuse.  One of his roommate, a super nice, super cute guy named “George” offered to help me get a few things still at their house that he had collected for me away from around the house.  He suggested I come up for the weekend, we go out and drink and have a good time, all the things Jake didn’t want to “waste” money on and I said sure!    
  
So I went up and George let me into the house while Jake was gone.  I took photos of all of his animals because while I might not be a PhD student, I paid attention and I knew he had an endangered species in his care.  He wasn’t breeding it, it was an un-releasable animal he had taken in from a rescue organization.  There was paperwork he had to submit with a $25 fee and he refused to do it, saying he didn’t want the government in his business.  I took photos of that animal, all his breeding conditions and a photo of an animal not allowed in the state which was in a tank, right next to a window and visible from outside.  I then went out for a night on the town with George.  We stumbled in early, around midnight so Jake and Meg who were watching TV would see me in a short dress, drunk and George practically carrying me.  I spent the night in George’s room.  He was a total gentleman but made sure to leave the room and parade past them in his boxers a few times and we giggled and moaned loudly so they could hear us.  When I went to leave the next morning, Jake said I didn’t have to act like a whore in front of him as I ate a donut slowly in my rumbled dress with messy hair while George beamed at me and then planted a kiss on my head.  Meg looked ashamed, not quite knowing where to look and I said have fun with my leftovers and walked out.  I wanted to think the petty, loud, “hook up” and a few juvenile insults was my “revenge”.  It was not.    
  
The next day I had my photos developed (ahhh, the good old days) and called the state office of Fish and Wildlife.  I reported the animals in the house, the potential over-crowding of breeding animals and the two animals he shouldn’t legally have at all in the state and asked them how to make a report.  Turns out Jake wasn’t well liked by his peers in his program, or by his roommates but I was!  George had suggested that he and their other roommate could submit complaints to the University that a TA was sleeping with one of his students and showing her favoritism.  The night we were out at the bars, we made sure to tell the story to anyone who they knew.  They made sure all the women in his classes knew he was sleeping with Meg.  It wasn’t a large program so people knew fast he had cheated and was now dating his student.  George and the other roommate made sure people knew they had put in complaints, sick of Jake’s entitled BS.    
  
With my full statement made and photos sent to the state wildlife officials, I called my friend Mary, Jake’s advisor’s wife.  She knew about the break up and lame reason and I let her know he admitted he was sleeping with a student.  I’d been emailing with him and he admitted to it in writing so I sent that to Mary.  To say she was not happy about that was an understatement.  She said she made sure it would be investigated and told her husband, Jake’s direct advisor while I was on the phone with her.    
  
Speaking of investigations, a few weeks later George called me, giddy, to say state Fish and Wildlife officials were there, confiscating animals.  He told them he would be happy to tell them whatever they needed to know.  Meg was there when it happened and told the officials as far as she knew, all the animals belonged to her boyfriend Jake and that they were all legal.  That put George and the other roommate in the clear.  One animal was kept in the backyard so it was implied to Jake that a neighbor reported it.  While they were there to investigate, they knew to look in the back window to see the far more problematic, illegal to have in the state under nearly any circumstances, animal.  Since George was on the lease, he was able to let them in to investigate in the house.  The animals were all in communal areas and the officers stayed there for a few hours and returned with a warrant to take all the animals and enter Jake’s room to investigate.  George and the other roommate let them into their rooms with no issues and were quickly cleared.  Meg apparently couldn’t get a hold of Jake and eventually drove to the University to find him.  Remember, no cell phones yet!  It was a good day.  The only animals they left was some guppies in a fish tank.    
  
Now, PhD students need grant money to do research and a large part of animal studies funding comes from the federal government.  Jake had just gotten an EPA grant right around when he broke up with me.  So I called the EPA and asked how I would report that a person with a federal grant was being investigated for illegally harboring endangered animals.  Long story short, he lost his EPA grant and had to make restitution on what had already been used, close to $30,000.  He would never be able to get another federal grant.  He avoided jail time on the state charges since all the animals were in good health but lost all his breeding animals (worth thousands of dollars) since they were collected for safe keeping during the investigation when the two illegal animals were taken.  In the end, he owed a $15,000 fine and the two animals went to a nearby nature center.  For years, I would stop by if I was in the area to visit them!    
  
The university revoked his scholarship and fired him from teaching for having an inappropriate relationship with a student.  He somehow escaped being expelled but it always shocked me that he never tried to hide the relationship with Meg and was so stupidly self assured he didn’t even wait the 4 weeks until she would have been done with his class to start publicly dating her.  By the University rules, he would have been in the clear to date her, not being her teacher anymore and she would just have to avoid any classes he was a TA in.  It never fails to make me laugh.  
  
After a few months, I emailed his sisters and told them I missed them because Jake broke up with me after trying to call me fat and cheating on me and I felt weird contacting them.  The girls told me he told the family I broke up with him because of the distance.  I forwarded them emails that Jake wrote after the breakup, talking about how he fell for Meg and he was sorry about it but it was true, I couldn’t keep up with him academically and it made him attracted to Meg.    
  
Jake managed to convince his dad to pay for one more year of school so he could get a Master’s instead of a PhD and while I stayed in contact with his sisters and brother via email and then social media, I largely let it all go.  I got even, made some friends, Mary became like an auntie to me and I went on with life.  I went on to get a master’s degree myself and my specialty?  Helping scientists and doctors communicate their work to lay people.  You know, us dummies who can’t remember all the scientific names.  I swear, it happened by accident, not design but I love it and I work with everyone from small town doctors and nurses to pharmaceutical companies to museums to state and federal governments to film and TV producers.  I travel a lot and speak and get to learn a lot of cool things about our planet and how things work.    
  
I knew through his siblings that Jake and Meg got married and had 2 kids.  Meg dropped out of the sciences and became an accountant, Jake went back to breeding animals.  Every once and awhile, his sisters or brother would tell me something over for lunch or via text but we had our own relationship that exists outside of him.  Apparently when I sent a wedding gift for one of his sisters he loudly complained at a co-ed bridal shower that all of his siblings still were my friend and didn’t make an effort to embrace his now wife, Meg.  Apparently the sister just laughed and said, I don’t make it a habit to be friends with homewreckers.  This is how Jake’s parents found out how their relationship started and ours ended, 10 years after we broke up.  Jake never found out I was behind reporting him to the state and in the end, I didn’t lie about a single thing, except maybe exaggerating a drunken make out session with George who is now a successful and tenured professor with a lovely wife and daughters.    
  
Fast forward about 20 years to a few weeks ago. I was at a university giving a lecture to a room of 250 undergrad and grad students.  In the end, I was mingling with the student afterwards and I hear a voice say, hey OP, long time no see and I realize it’s Jake and I didn’t change the expression on my face, at all.  I was completely shocked and my instinct was to play dumb!  So I said, I’m sorry, help me out, have we met at another workshop or lecture?  He looked incredulous and said, it’s me Jake and I said, I can’t place you but I would love to figure it out.  Finally I gasped and said, oh my goodness, Jake!  I guess I blocked you out and said, well, lovely to see you and moved on quickly when he tried to reach out and hug me.  I was happy to leave it there, with the satisfaction of him seeing me as a guest lecturer in a science department of a major University when he was just in the audience.  
  
The department chair and faculty who had invited me to speak took me out to dinner and while there, one of them said, so you know Jake?  I said, I did from over 20 years ago, being vague about how.  She went on to tell me he had been there for an interview for a teaching position and had spent a few days there observing and they were likely going to hire him.  I couldn’t control it, I scoffed.  When they all looked at me I said, I’m sorry, I’m just shocked he’s teaching after what happened at University X.  They said what happened and I said, he was sleeping with a 19 year old student when he was 26 and he had to leave the program without a PhD because he couldn’t afford to stay after losing his scholarship.  The three people I was with all looked at each other like they knew they had a problem and said, wow, we’ll have to look into that and changed the subject.    
  
My old friend Mary (retired a year or 2 now but still friendly with her old collages) called me this weekend to say a friend at the university let her know someone had called doing a background check about Jake and they pulled his file which included being fired, leaving the program with a lower degree and the complaint letters from over 20 years ago about his conduct.  Mary’s name had been on it with her husband listed as the faculty advisor, so she thought she’d like to know.  As a bonus, it had a copy of his arrest record for the illegal animals.  I guess his dad had paid for a decent lawyer to get the record expunged after the charges were reduced and he paid the fines so it doesn’t show up on a standard background check.  I don’t think he’s going to get that job.  
  
So I will return to my life, content that the universe comes through sometimes, especially if you give it a little nudge now and then.  The best revenge is when you don’t have to do anything wrong, you just have to help direct knowledge to the right places.  If there is anything I can impart to any young women and men reading this, as I shimmy happily into my now size 10 pants, it’s that, if someone who is supposed to love you complains about your weight or looks, that is their problem to fix mentally, not yours and maybe it’s time to check out what they are doing behind your back or simply move on.  Remember though, it is their flaw, not yours.  If Jake hadn’t been a coward and tried to make me break up with him and just ended things with me in a mature way, I might not have found out about Meg and turned his own wickedness back on himself.

ProRevenge,Say Goodbye to Your House and Your Retirement,"This one is not technically my revenge but some revenge I got to see up close and take joy from, and slightly participate in.

The background is most of the story so this will be a little long.

Trigger warning for self harm.

I was in the Navy and stationed on the submarine base in Connecticut.

I had a friend I met in boot camp and we were in the same class for our A school (Navy job training)

We'll call that friend Bill.

Now Bill wasn't the most physically fit guy. He was short, kind of chubby, and wore glasses.

However Bill was really smart, and as the sonar technician he was meant to be he would've been amazing. He had a pragmatic way of looking at things I really valued in a friend and I know it would have made him successful if he had made it out to the fleet.

While in school we had a couple of petty officers that were hard asses. They somehow convinced themselves they were super soldiers despite the fact that our jobs in that field are really nerd centric. You get picked for that job because of your math and computer skills, not your deadlift number.

Still they were both all about being fit and working out all the time.

We would do physical training 3 times a week and while most of us could keep up, Bill often fell behind on runs or didn't quite meet what these two idiots believed to be the standard. To be clear, Bill did pass the minimum requirements for fitness, he just didn't go as extreme as these guys. (Side note for other Navy vets, he got the MCPON coin for how hard he pushed himself at PT the day he visited.)

The end result was that they would constantly berate and belittle Bill. They'd call him fat, lazy, and everything else, They'd tell him he should kill himself, you name it. They were always on his ass despite him passing his assessments.

At some point, Bill pushed himself too hard an injured his knee. He told these petty officers he was injured and had been seen by the doc on base. The doc had put him on light duty so the knee could recover. He had the paperwork to back it up.

They elected to ignore that and threaten him with kicking him out if he didn't do the workouts.

So Bill kept pushing himself, injuring himself more, and his mental health degraded the whole time.

In my time in the Navy you didn't get mental health services really, the only person to talk to like that was the Chaplain. For those who don't know, the Chaplain is the religious leader, usually a pastor/priest/rabbi that has signed up as a commissioned officer. Our Chaplain was the sweetest little woman you ever met, but as a Chaplain she held the rank of Captain (high ranking officer).

So Bill set up a meeting with the Chaplain to talk about things.

When Bill informed the petty officers he would be missing class the next day for his Chaplain meeting, they yelled at and berated him more.

They called him a pussy, useless, not fit for the Navy, and everything else you can imagine. They convinced Bill he was being weak and the Chaplain wouldn't care about his issues, that nobody would care. They promised to make life even harder if he didn't show the next day. So he cancelled his meeting.

Evidently, bad luck hit and that night his girlfriend was also breaking it off with him. (She wasn't worth his time or money but he couldn't see that)

That night I awoke to a 3:00 AM call from Bill. I couldn't hear anything and I asked several times ""Bill you there? Are you ok?""

It wouldn't have been the first time that I got a drunk dial from one of my friends after a hard day like Bill had. Sailors have been known to drown their sorrows a bit.

Eventually I figured it was a butt dial/ drunk dial and hung up and went back to bed. I still regret that decision.

The next day, all hell broke loose.

Me and a couple other friends got calls from Bill's now ex-girlfriend informing us he was in the hospital because he slit his own throat.

Turned out a few of us got that 3:00 AM call, but Bill couldn't speak at the time and was kind of out of it due to blood loss.We finished what we had to do on base and rushed over to the hospital.

As we got there, the Chaplain was on her way out and we passed her in the hallway.

She spoke to us briefly to say that Bill would be ok, and she wouldn't forget this.

I have never seen a look on someone's face that so accurately depicted raw unfiltered rage.

It took us all by surprise because she was such a small, sweet, and personable lady.

But the look in her eyes, you could just tell she wanted someone to pay for this, she wanted revenge and we all knew she wore the kind of rank that could get it done.

We visited Bill who could barely talk but he told us the story of what had happened, what he was thinking at the time and how glad he was it didn't work.

Apparently it was cold enough that the blood clotted on the outside of his neck and made a kind of patch that kept him alive long enough for the EMS to find him and get him to a hospital. The Doctor said he missed his carotid by about a millimeter.

A week went by and we hadn't heard anything until we got called in by the Chief of the training command (the boss to these petty officers). He said he wanted to check on the rest of us and make sure there weren't any other issues with these guys he wasn't aware of, and that we were all ok.

I let him know about an ass chewing he gave me a few months back, that I was really set up by these guys and they had lied to him. My friends cited a couple other examples of their own with these guys being generally shitty dishonest people.

I don't think it mattered, I think their fates were already sealed and we were being asked for more ammo to bury them with.

The next day they were nowhere to be found and we were introduced to new instructors who would be taking over our training permanently.

After class, I decided to stop by and asked the Chaplain what happened.

She told me she had never been more disgusted by the actions of a sailor than these two guys who convinced someone NOT to come see her.

She teared up a bit regretting that she didn't get the chance to help Bill before he made his attempt. In her mind, it was these two that precipitated and enabled Bill's attempt.

So on to the revenge:

The Chaplain told me she went to the Admiral in charge of the entire base, and demanded their immediate discharge. He granted it. Both petty officers were immediately processed out with dishonorable discharges. I can't remember the exact charge I heard they cited for it, but I know the Navy has a way of selling BS on paper when they want a certain outcome. Especially officers at that high level.

So basically they get no VA benefits of any kind, got kicked out of the base housing they lived in, and could probably only find work at a gas station or under the table stuff somewhere. Also I know from someone else who got the boot that the Navy only pays for a single bus ticket to get you back home, not your family or any of your belongings.

When you have a discharge like that, no company with DOD contracts is allowed to hire you. That includes McDonalds because they have stores on bases throughout the country. Taco bell, Subway, etc. none of them will give you a job. They can't and they don't want to anyway.

So I don't know where these guys went or what become of them, but I know their lives were irrevocably ruined. One of them had about 18 years in, so he was 2 years from retirement and lost it all. The other was at about 12 years, so he also lost a lot. Wherever they are now, I'd be very surprised to hear they're making more than minimum wage.

As for Bill? Well he made a full recovery, he got a full medical discharge. Which is an honorable discharge that meant E5 pay for the rest of his life, full benefits, and a referral to a counselor in his home state once he got back there. All paid for by the Navy.

We lost touch over the years but I did see on Facebook he got himself together, became a police officer, and got married.

\*Edit to add\*

For those who have pointed it out, their discharges were actually OTH but I didn't want to have to explain the difference or have people google it. We always used dishonorable colloquially for OTH/BCD because they all mean you got the boot and your life is gonna suck.  But no they didn't do full CM or any brig time, but I did hear they pushed it to ASB and lost. 

Also saw someone pointed out Bill wouldn't get the medical at 100% for his neck, that's also true he wouldn't have but they wrote it up for his knee cause it was basically bone on bone inside. I think they decided to do him a favor and not put him down as a mental health discharge. ",2769,0.97,137,Flowing_Oddity,2024-03-28 15:42:28,1bq64qd,2906,High
ProRevenge,"Try and get my Team Member Fired, Get Deported!","I am not sure if this is pro revenge, so I will let you all decide (if not let me know and I will move it). I will say in advance sorry for the long one, but the backstory is relevant.

  
Back in the early 2010’s I started working for a big internet based company in the UK. The company was opening a new office with a new subdivision in London. When I started there were two team leaders and the office manager. The two teams were the content team and the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) team. I was recruited to be the development team lead (that is web development).

  
When I was interviewed for the job, both the office manager and SEO team lead were carrying out the interview. As you do in interviews when they asked if this or that could be done I would respond “Yes of course” or “You know you would get a better result doing X, Y or Z”.

  
So, I got offered the job and for the first year there was so much going on. As well as building a team, I also had a portfolio of websites that needed to be redeveloped and redesigned. It was at this point that some red flags started to pop up. I would have the SEO team lead (we will call him Andy), coming to me and telling me that I needed to do things the way he wanted. I would always push back and say no, and give a reason why I was doing things the way I was. Andy would get irate and would complain to the office manager about me. When the office manager would ask me about it I would explain what had happened and why I had said no and the office manager would leave it there because at the end of the day I was the one with the experience in web development not Andy. This happened a few times over the first year and I then realised that the reason that Andy was getting so irate was because he thought that I would be a yes man to him. Sorry buddy, that is not who I am.

  
So, now that we have the backstory let’s get into what lead to the revenge.

  
Me and the team had been working hard to get two of the new websites completed, and I was due to show them off to the board before they went live. This company’s head office was in another part of the country, and I had to leave the office in London at about lunch time. So, I arrive to the hotel that is across the road from the head office about 4pm and jump on my laptop to start going through the sites to run some tests. I was testing functionality, making sure the look and feel were correct, things like that. Then it happened, we found a major bug that caused a major issue with the functionality of the website. So it is at this point that I am going to introduce the star of our story, Johnny (not real name, but attacked all the same) who was my Senior Developer. Me and Johnny working through the night, me in the hotel room and him in the London office. We finally fixed the bug, about 7am the following day. My meeting with the board was at 10am, so after getting showered, feed and over to the office I started my day with zero hours sleep.

  
I go into the meeting and the first thing that is said, is the CEO asking if I was ok (I had meet him a few times and he was a really nice guy). I explained that we had found an issue with the sites yesterday and me and Johnny had worked through the night to fix it before the meeting. Long story short everyone was really impressed and loved the new sites. At the end of the meeting the CEO pulled me aside and thanked me for everything and then told me to go home and get some sleep (it was about a 3 hour train ride to London and then another hour home). I thanked him and when on my way.

  
So, after taking my team out for a well-deserved lunch to say thank you. The office manager then organised a night out for the whole office to celebrate on the following Friday. We started off at a fancy bar (not my sort of thing, I am a man of cheap tastes) and then everyone moves on to a small club. I go to the club for a bit, but then leave quite early in the night as I need to get a train home. I say my byes and then head home.

  
I come into the office on the Monday and there is something going on. I speak with Emma (Not real name) the content team’s lead. She does not know what is going on, but there are people from head office, HR and others. Then a few minutes later all the team leaders are call into a meeting. We are all squished in one of the small meeting rooms, there is office manager, two members of the HR team from head office and the three team leaders (including myself). So, HR explain that there has been a complaint made against Johnny. A member of the SEO team (we will call him Mark) had called Andy on the Friday saying that Johnny had been making racist comments while everyone was out at the club. Both myself and Emma were taken aback, this was not like Johnny.

On a side note, I fell that I need to explain the races of people involved. This is just for context and not an attack on anyone involved. Johnny, Emma and I are white British. Andy is African (born in Britain, I believe), and Mark is Indian (once again I believe).

  
So, the whole day was spent with HR doing interviews with the other people that were there that night and we then all reconvened towards the end of the day. The result of the interviews were that no one had heard anything like what Mark was saying. So, it was Marks word against Johnny's, this was not acceptable for Andy. He wanted Johnny fired and cried ""we could not have someone like that in the office"".

  
So, both Emma and I looked at each other and though that it was strange that he was so instant on firing Johnny with no evidence. Both the office manager and HR agreed, and Johnny was let off with a warning and to be aware in the future of how things he says that could be mis-interpreted.

  
Life went back to normal in the office, that is until about two months later. The story of what had happened had gone round the office (about 12 people). Then one afternoon, I was pulled aside by one of the guys on the content team and he said that he had over heard Andy and Mark talking and thought I should know. We went into on of the meeting rooms and he laid everything out.

  
What I heard made my blood boil and I think had I been in a cartoon steam would have been erupting from my ears. He told me that the racism complaint was faked and a plan that Andy had to attack my team because I would not bend to his demands. Him and Mark we on a call outside the club (Andy was not there that night) and that is when he heard what they were doing. It later came out that their plan was to make the complaint against Johnny and get him fired which would then lead on to Andy complaining that I was not fit to run a team if I let that sort of this happen under my leadership.

  
My first question was why he didn’t bring this up with HR in the interviews, he said that he did but it was his word against both Andy and Mark. I thanked him for this and went on with what I was doing. I WAS PISSED!!!!!!! There was no way that I was going to let the slide, but I knew that if I was going to go after them, I needed to have everything in place before hand. I didn’t tell Johnny what I had been told and asked the guy that told me to keep it to himself for now. I didn’t want Johnny to get pissed off and do something that would get him fired or worse affect any revenge I could dish out.

  
So, I watched. I watched everything the SEO team did (and didn’t) do. Then it happened, it was like angles had descended from heaven to deliver me the winning lottery ticket.

  
The building we were in was a three story building with a main stair well with a door on each floor to the offices. The stair well also lead to a door out to the street . At the time I was a casual smoker and used it to get a break from the screen and clear my head if something I was working on was not going well. So, I walk out of the door to the office and into the stair well and who is there…. Mark of all people.

He is on the phone, and he goes white as a sheet when he sees me. Now he is mid-sentence with the person on the other end of the phone and as I am walking past, he is forced to carry on the conversation. I overhear, and from what he is saying I can tell that he is talking to a school or something like that. The conversation sounding like he was looking for information about applying and about a visa. I thought that was a strange call to be having and something was fishy about it. 

  
I had my suspicions as to what was going on, but nothing concreate at this time. A few days later I was heading back up to the head office and by that time we had a new office manager who lived near the head office so was based there most of the time. When I got there, I dropped my things off at the hotel and headed over to the office. I went to his desk and ask to have a quick chat. I explained to him what I had over heard Mark talking about on the phone and said that maybe the company might like to look at his visa status.

  
So, a week went by and nothing seemed to happen…… then BAM!!!!! He stopped showing up to the office. A few days later I got told what had happened from one of the other SEO team members. Mark had been fired with immediate effect for no longer having the correct visa to work in the UK (the company did not want to get involved in sponsoring a new visa for him, I don't know why). I started asking questions around the office (random chit chat) and I found out that Mark is from Dubai and he was here on his wife’s student visa (I don’t know how that works, but it was all above board). I also found out that his wife’s course had finished and that left them with a small window of time to get a new visa.

  
That is when it all clicked.

&#x200B;

Now there are some doggy people in London (and everywhere else) and they would setup these fake collages that would sign people up to get visas to live and work in to UK. At some point before or after this saw a program on this and normally these were setup in tiny offices that you couldn’t swing a cat in let alone be a collage. They were used as postal addressed for the ""collage"", and they would charge a “course fee” to be enrolled and thus be able to apply for a student visa.

  
So, what Mark was trying to do is to get “enrolled” in one of these “collages” so that he could stay in the UK and carry on working.

  
I found out a few weeks later that Mark and his wife did have to leave the UK and go back to Dubai because he didn’t have any money coming in to pay for his new “collage” course. BYE MARK!!!!!!!!

  
When I found out that Mark had been let go, I pulled Johnny aside and filled him in on everything. He could not believe it and was stunned that they would try and do that. I apologised to him as it was my fault that he had been targeted by them in a way to get at me. He would not accept it and said that I had gone above and beyond in defending him.

  
Following on from this I made it quite clear to Andy that I know what he and Mark had done, and I would not be forgetting it and to watch his back (I made sure we were not in ear shot of anyone else). About two months later Andy handed in his notice and left the company, never to be seen or heard from again.

  
I have told this story to some people over the years, and I have been asked so many times if I feel guilty for what I did. I always respond the same way,

  
  
“I feel guilty that Johnny, was wrongfully accused and targeted. I don’t feel guilty about what I did to Mark. You don’t mess with my friends, family or team.”

ProRevenge,Metered On Ramps,"Back when metered on ramps were first installed on the main highway in my town in Oregon, the interval between lights on the ramp I used daily was 15 seconds. Cars would be backed up onto the adjacent feeder streets, and you could be stuck for 15-20 minutes on the ramp.

Took a bit of research to find out that it wasn't the City or County, but ODOT (Oregon Department of Transportation) that controlled them.

After repeated complaints and no action, I finally got the names of the two ODOT Traffic Engineers responsible for setting the light intervals. 

I made numerous voice mails, and finally, had one discussion, but still no fix to the issue.

Well, back in the day (early 2000s), we still had phone books, and both these Engineers had listed home phone numbers.

I got a 4x8 piece of plywood and painted & lettered it:

""Tired of these idiotic ramp lights?

Call the ODOT Engineers responsible for them.

Dennis Mxxxxxxx 503 xxx xxxx

Bill Cxx  503 xxx xxxx

And let them know what you think.""

I stood with it on the side of the ramp for 2 days, 4pm to 6pm.

The next day, I get a call from one of them (don't remember which) begging me to stop.

I said ""Fix the fucking lights""

""You'll stop with the sign?""

""Fix the fucking lights""

""OK""

The very next day, they had a survey crew out there in the afternoon to count cars, and the day after that, the lights were reset to 3 seconds between cars. 

Bottom line...when dealing with government, until those personally responsible are held accountable in a manner that inconveniences or scares them, they will continue to abuse the public, whether from negligence, incompetence or malice. But bring it home to them, and they will (grudgingly) change their ways.",4010,0.97,174,Maximum_Power4088,2024-01-25 03:19:25,19f5egz,4184,High
ProRevenge,So sue me...can do,"I originally posted the story in malicious compliance and a few were saying it would be great here and at r/nuclearrevenge 

  
I am a military veteran who was injured in Iraq, I mention only because it is important to the story.  
I worked for this company I say company but in reality it was a guy who owned a few businesses and he was the richest person in a very small town. It's important to say how I made it to this situation, I will try and make it quick so I can get to the steak and taters as it where. I joined the military before I even completed highschool late birthdays and all of that. I choose a military career path that I figured I would enjoy and since I love working on things I became a mechanic. It offered a great sign on bonus so that was a bonus. I went through basic only ever spending money on necessities so saved up quite a lot. Saved even more through advanced training for my mos (military job) by the time I was done with both I had half of my sign on bonus and just short of an entire years pay in my bank account. At my age most would have splurged I invested in the stock market Bitcoin and paid off my parents house. A couple of deployments the other half of my bonus and the only thing I really ever spent money on outside of necessities was my hotrod. Needless to say I had some money saved up and invested it also. Long story short when I discharged I was pretty comfortable even after a nasty divorce.  
Don't get me wrong I didn't/don't have stupid money but because of the divorces a lot of stocks were cashed out split and if anyone follows Bitcoin over the past two decades you know how that turned out. After my divorce I worked to recover what I lost and then just to keep busy. Like I said I love working as a mechanic and would bounce around where ever I felt like since a good mechanic can make money anywhere.  
After a decade of this I decided to set roots in a small town since it would be nice and quiet. By this point I was tired of always working on others people cars and wanted to devote time to working on my car. I bought a small house and saw a help wanted sign at the local lube shop. Figured it would be simple work for me and be something to cover my few expenses.  
I grab an application from the office getting all kinds of looks from the townies. Btw I am 6'3 since I discharged from the military I stopped cutting my hair and shaving and I have one full sleeve. Needless to say most people cross the street instead of walk past.  
When I went to turn in my application to we will call her Sue the bookkeeper she ask me a couple of questions noticed I checked I was a veteran and puts a y on my application. Later that day sue calls me and ask if I would come back in to meet the owner let's call him Peter. I agree and sue says Peter will be there in an hour so if I come in then we can talk about the position.  
I show up and Peters eyes bulge at first sight but we get to chatting and my southern charm wins him over, he tossed me a calendar that he had made of his car collection and ask me to name of the ones I recognized. There were a couple of mustangs a Ford gt a bricklin sv-1 a judge a demon a Pantera and a mxt. He was impressed that I knew what the sv-1 was and we chatted cars for a bit. He offered me the position and explained that I would be paid $100 dollars a day and that I would work mon-sat from 8-6 no overtime but I would get a full days pay even if we closed shop early for some reason, and eat when I could. I would be off every Sunday and one extra day during the week.  
Awesome start and work maybe a year no issues. Peter ask if I could help him out by being a relief worker for his other lube shops in neighboring towns, he says he will give me $20 every day for travel and basically I would be covering so guys could take days off at the other stores. I agreed and did this for about a year then disaster strikes Peter meets Karen and falls madly in love in the span of a month they are married and he starts supporting her and her gambling problem.  
This is when all of the problems start, one week I notice my paycheck was only $250 and ask about it, sue tells me apparently there have been some changes and I should really speak to Peter about it. Sure no problem I call up Peter and ask if we can talk about somethings. He shows up with Karen in tow and when I asked why my pay was short he tells me it was because of the bad weather and us closing early affected the business, I would have let it go at that because Peter was a nice guy but Karen decided to speak. "" It isn't very fair to us to have to pay you for a full day if you don't work the full ten hours."" I said that would be true if I wasn't on a negotiated day rate and if I get paid for each day I work not hourly that why I don't get paid 19 hrs overtime each week. She claims that's not how it works anymore that from now on I would be paid for the hours I worked and nothing else. Ok what ever you say Karen.  
Fast forward to the next week we had a weeks worth of very busy days were we were open a couple hours later than normal to finish up with waiting customers. And I gave up one of my days off to cover for a sick coworker. So when what should have easily been over an $800 paycheck was only $600 I had some questions. I called Peter and asked him what was going on why I only got paid $600 and he says well that's what we agreed on a $100 a day. I look at him blankly and ask if he forgot about last week and he asked what about it I reminded him and he just says it is what it is.  
Ok so at this point I am aggravated and that is when Karen walks and and ask so what is he bitching about now. I look at her coldly and say well I worked 80 hours last week and yall only paid me $600 she looks at me and says ""you're contracted labor and you agreed to $100 per day so why would we pay you more than that."" I look at Peter and ask is that how it is he just says you heard the lady.  
I went home and convinced myself that I was only working to cover my few living expenses anyway the job isn't that hard. The only other things in this small town would have been assembling sheds or slinging chickens at a chicken plant.  
The next week one of the guys I work with is getting yelled at in front of customers by Karen about what she claims is an OSHA violation. She claims that as part owner of the company it his her responsibility to ensure that all OSHA regulations are met and his apparent violation was him wearing tinted safety glasses. Now this is BS because the bays faced east west and with how the cars pulled in top workers got the sun during the day and the pit worker got it in the evening I shake my head as I am walking in and like a T-Rex in a dinosaur movie it attracted karens attention and she decides to shout at me ""you got something to say you big bitch"" and I just kept walking.  
I told Sue she needed to have a long talk with Peter before karens mouth wrote checks he would have to cash and she says I just keep the books don't involve me. So this behavior goes on another year and finally I am at my limit.  
On the day I started my malicious compliance I was in a very bad mood. I had woken up to news that a good friend of mine that was responsible for me surviving being blown up in Iraq was taken out by a drunk driver. Not wanting to deal with anyone I tell the shop I will be working pit all day and to just let me be these guys have been working with me a few years now and know something is up. I never once thought that this would be a day that I would need to deal with Karen, since I was working at the furthest shop from the main shop and it was in the opposite direction of the casinos. But I wasn't so lucky or maybe I was, Peter and Karen show up and she storms into the pit and scream Peter come look at this mess. I have no idea what she is talking about about because I always kept the pit spotless and would clean as I worked were a lot of others would clean at the end of the day. Her complaint was about 50 of the most common oil filters we would use in a day being stacked on my waste drums for easy access to me so I wouldn't have to wait to the top guys to hand me filters. I did this all of the time and Peter knew about it and never cared before he comes down looks around and tells me like he is talking to a teenager ""clean up this pigsty. I shake my head and say todays not the day Peter move on and take her with you.  
This apparently infuriated Karen who of course thought it was the utmost disrespect to her and Peter, and he tells me if I don't like it I am free to leave so I left. Now don't freak out this story isn't over yet that it just the first flap of the butterflies wings that started a massive shit storm. The next day Peter calls me and ask me to swing by the main store on my way home. I think he is going to apologize about the day before figured one of the other guys might have told him why I was so on edge. No that was not what this was about. Peter was calling me in to inform me that for the next six months I would be on a probation period for my actions and for these 6 months I would only be paid $50 a day and I wouldn't receive the normal $20 a day I received for driving to the other shops. I ask if he is serious about this and if he has seriously considered what he was doing.  
This is when peters let his true colors shine he tells me I am lucky I wasn't fired for my constant disrespect towards him and the co owner Karen how if he didn't pitty me for being a struggling disabled veteran (I never once discussed my money with anyone I worked with why Peter thought I was broke and desperate was solely based on my appearance from what I could tell.)he would have fired me long ago. Something inside me snapped and I just started laughing he asked me what I thought was so funny and I stood to my full height stepped to him like a drill sergeant about to give some wall to wall counseling and say you should re consider your life choices and who you choose to go into business with. Peter then says ""what you gonna sue me or something go ahead if you think you can afford to what do you get from the va like $1000 dollars a month I know how bad you need this job.""  
That wasn't my plan but it kicked in my malicious compliance and since I will always be a solider to go to war. That day I called a labor lawyer paid the 3k retainer and started my lawsuit for unsafe work environment, unpaid overtime, and minimum wage violations. All while continuing to work for him it was glorious but still not enough. It took about the 6months of my probation for the lawyer to get off of the paperwork together and filed slow rolling it on my request and this lawyer was a former marine so I think he had an idea of what I had in mind.  
After everything was ready my lawyer filed the paperwork and Peter and Karen were served at the main store while I was at work. They read the paperwork and the process server for my lawyer stuck around to be a witness to what I knew would be coming. When they read that I was suing them Karen and Peter flipped Peter shouts I should kick your ass you ungrateful piece of shit and Karen screams you're fucking fired you pussy I bet you weren't even really in the military.  
The process server recorded everything gave it to my lawyer who added to the law suit unlawful termination because it is illegal to fire an employee because they are suing you.  
The next day I opened up my lube shop carwash combo and started recruiting my former co-workers at higher pay plus commission. They also wanted to jump in on the lawsuit and my lawyer was more than happy to add them to it.  
So 2 years down the road after subpoenas to get security footage from the shops, the books going back five years, and sworn testimonies we go to a mediation to settle they offer a measley 50k to split between the 15 of us on the lawsuit when that didn't even cover the unpaid overtime.  
We declined then our apache came in to save the day  
sent by the IRS delivered to my lawyer because of request for the company's tax documents. Peter held each lube shop as it's own individual llc each with it's own tax id and employment record. Peter and Karen thought it would be a smart move to file for a tax credit for employing a veteran at each of the 6 shops. In their filing they claimed that they employed a veteran me as a full time employee working a minimum 36hrs a week at rate of $12/hr.(the government gives a tax brake to companies that employee veterans)  
At the next mediation my lawyer presented the reports to their lawyer and the mediator and after a quick 20min discussion Peter and Karen came back and agreed to settle at our request of 400k in unpaid overtime to be split between 15 of us all legal fees and a personal settlement for the unlawful termination suit of 20k for each shop I was listed as an employee at as well as unpaid wages for the six months I was only paid $5 an hour. Their only demand was that we all agree to a gag order so that nothing would leave the mediators table.  
Of course we signed and we took our paychecks. But some how their tax paperwork made its way to just the right person at the IRS and they decided to audit Peter and Karen. And and investigation was opened on them for tax fraud.  
I sold the shop I opened to the guys that came over and jumped in on the lawsuit they each paid me 8k and I washed my hands of it. I put my house up for sale and moved away.  
I did go back about 8 months later because the guy who was supposed to take care of the lawn had apparently been arrested and the yard went a few months without being cut before the city informed me that they were going to fine me $100 a day until it was brought to code so I went down to mow it my self while there I decided to check in with my realtor to see if there was anything we could do about yard maintenance and who do I see but little ol sue sitting pretty at the front desk.  
Sue couldn't speak fast enough to tell me what all had happened and it was perfect. What I thought was an Apache turned out to be an atom bomb, Peter filed bankruptcy to try and not go broke after making a plea deal for probation for tax fraud and paying a ton in unpaid taxes Karen took off with some dude she met at a casino. I asked sue two questions if she knew who reported the fraudulent tax paperwork to the IRS and what happened with peters car collection she told me I have no idea and to check the parking behind the realtors office before leaving. On my way out I took a peak behind the realtors office to see a safety green sv-1 sitting there. Apparently Peter started selling off his cars early and cheap hoping he would be able to buy them back after filing bankruptcy.  
To this day I have no idea who if anyone actually turned in the paperwork to the IRS. My personal theory is who ever was tasked with compiling it all with their claims noticed something strange and reported it. How ever it happened it couldn't have happened to anyone more deserving",3694,0.96,257,Forsaken-Salad-1623,2024-01-23 02:25:27,19djqa0,3951,High
ProRevenge,Landlord screwed with the wrong tenant for too long,"This will be decently long as it needs some context. I'm going to throw in a lot of stuff to make it all easier to understand as well. I'll put a \*\*\* where the story proper starts, in case anyone wants to skip the preamble.

Minor details might not be entirely accurate as I've no interest in a revival of this conflict on any level. I won completely, and any resurrection can only taint the experience.

We'll start off by noting that I spent about 2 decades working in security. During that time I worked many different types of security in many different locations. The one that matters for this story was time spent in the Rental Housing Tribunal in a major city, as a kind of bailiff.

For those not knowing what that is, think a court room (in a major city anyway, in a smaller town it'll probably be an event room in a hotel or community centre) as you'd see on tv but with less formality and an adjudicator instead of a judge. They functionally are the same thing to landlords and tenants, but they definitely aren't the same thing. This place exclusively deals with landlord and tenant disputes, and is the only place to resolve landlord and tenant disputes.

Note that I wasn't a bailiff, and it wasn't a court, but these terms mostly accurately describe the situation and my place in it.

For 2 years I worked at the Rental Housing Tribunal, it was early in my time in security I was 18-20ish. Being as it was a major city, the sheer number of cases I sat through was beyond my ability to count. I saw everything there was to see. Noone is capable of surprising me with a story because I've seen them all. In detail, as a side duty of mine was to ensure all parties had copies of all evidence being presented. I did a lot of photocopying, and always read/inspected everything I copied to ensure nothing got cut off or made illegible.

By the time I stopped working there I probably knew the way everything worked well enough to be an adjudicator myself. Well no obviously not, but I'm certainly in no need of a lawyer either should I ever have need to go there.

I also had intimate knowledge of how the system worked beyond the actual rules. Like, for example, adjudicators would always give a little leeway to anyone representing themselves over someone who had a lawyer. Or how pissed off adjudicators would get when a party was speaking out of turn. Seriously do not do that.

\*\*\*

Skip forward almost a decade. I left the city and am in a fairly large town in the same Province (same tenant laws). I have a few roommates in a decently sized townhouse. We get along well. But there's a problem. Only I can write cheques, and our paydays don't line up. So I'm the one who pays the rent, and I usually can't do it on the 1st because roommates don't usually all pay in time. We advise the landlord we might be a day or two late but we'll always have it by the 3rd at the latest. They have no problem with it at all, I spoke to them myself.

For about a year this works fine. No complaints from landlord because even if we're often a day or 2 late, we always pay. We're also fairly quiet and don't damage the property. Nearly model tenants.

I do not actually have any idea why, but one day this changed. I suspect a different person in the company started overseeing the region. One day, suddenly we got a summons to the Rental Housing Tribunal (hereafter to be referred to as RHT) on the 2nd of the month for failure to pay rent. This doesn't actually lead to a case because we paid the same day. But now we have to pay the application fee the landlord paid in order to serve the summons. I bitched to the neighbour who was also the superintendent and eventually heard back that their contact at the company was now demanding 1st of the month no exceptions.

Well that really didn't work for us, so we probably had to pay that fee 15-20 times over the next 2 years. I could have gone to tribunal over it but we were technically without a leg to stand on and I knew it. Maybe if I went enough times I can ding them for harassment but I don't have time for that and my roommates don't care. After being split between us all the fee wasn't enough deterrent to change our behaviour so we accepted it.

If this was the only issue, there wouldn't be much story though. At around the same time the rent leeway vanished, so did mandatory maintenance. I'm not going to list everything that went wrong and wasn't fixed. You'll get a decent idea at the end.

We suffered through it. We were all working too many hours at shit pay to be able to actually do anything about it. We adapted.

But after about 2 years it broke. Everyone but me up and moved out for various reasons within a 4 month period. I'm not going into any details on my roommates at all because things kinda exploded for a couple different reasons outside of this. No reason to dig any of that up.

I had been saving up awhile and was able to quit my job without having to immediately get another so I suddenly had a lot of time. I didn't want to stay and pay the rent by myself or have to find new roommates I could live with, and with my experience in the RHT I knew I had the landlord by the balls.

So I went for them. I stopped paying rent. Annoyingly I didn't get a summons the 1st month. But I did the 2nd. So I went. With a meticulously documented plethora of evidence of failure to maintain the property and entering the property without formal notice. I had a copy for the landlord and a copy for the adjudicator. I know from experience that technically you're supposed to give the other party the evidence before the tribunal, but I also knew about that leeway an adjudicator gives to those who represent themselves. So I didn't give the landlord the evidence until our case came up, 100% total ambush.

They argued they were ambushed, but the adjudicator just dismissed the case, dressed me down a little, and told me to file my own summons as I should have done. This was the petty revenge. The landlord and lawyer drove 3 hours to get there, for nothing. Worse than nothing.

I filed my own summons, and the big day shows up. It's been about 4 months of me not paying rent at this point. I'm prepared to if I lose, but I don't think I'm going to lose.

The whole thing could not have gone better. I had 20-30 pages of evidence and 20 odd photographs, they had nothing. They had no actual defence for our water heater being out for 6 months or us not having a fridge for a year, just to mention 2 severe issues. Their entire defence rested on us being late for rent, which actually worked against them once that led to the adjudicator learning how many times we'd paid the application fee, and lies that had no evidence to support them. They even talked over me a few times, and I SAW IN HIS EYES the one time I opened my mouth to protest during their turn to speak but forced myself to shut up with every gram of willpower I had so only a squeak came out, the adjudicator respected me. He had no respect for the landlord. I had won on every possible front. The only question was how much.

It was more than I'd ever seen. I got 9 months of free rent, and the landlord was ordered to have everything fixed before the next month was over or I'd get more. I gave notice I was leaving at the end of the 8th month and left at the end of the 9th. Because the landlord had never renewed the lease I didn't have to give him the 3 month notice the lease specified.

If you want a figure to put to it, I basically got a $13,000 judgement in my favour, adjusted for inflation and rounded. I also made the landlord and lawyer drive 3 hours, twice, only to lose. The landlords face was so red at the end I thought he'd have a heart attack. He didn't though. Bye Mark!

&#x200B;

Edit to clarify a few things based on questions.

I also want to add for those good landlords out there, I do feel you. My time in the RHT was eye opening. For every bad landlord there are 10 bad tenants easily. There's a massive debate of debates to have over the whole thing I'll only say that I do sympathize with the good landlords out there. I'm not trying to paint all landlords as terrible. This is the only landlord I've ever had that was so useless.

Edit

I've revised my estimate of the ratio based on a little research and some comments from 30 tenants per landlord to 10. I'm probably still wrong, but the sheer number disparity between landlords and tenants effectively requires there be more bad tenants than bad landlords simply because there are so many more tenants than landlords. I'm going to leave it at that and just beg you not to rip me apart from either side. I'm intimately aware of the problems both good landlords and good tenants face and my sympathy goes out to both sides.",2523,0.96,144,TheVaneja,2024-01-20 04:15:46,19b8q27,2667,High
ProRevenge,Stick me with hidden charges? I'll show you...,"So this past Christmas, my missus and I purchased one of our 9yr old son's Santa gifts from a certain UK sports retail company that also have many stores here in Ireland as well. It was a football rebounder, kinda like a trampoline that you kick the ball at and it bounces back to you. Anyway we purchased it from their Irish website and thought nothing more of it. A few days go by and we get a notification from a certain brown uniformed courier company that there are customs charges due on something, and as you can imagine we've bought many things for the kids so we had to double check what we've ordered and we didn't have anything left that was being imported so we naturally assumed it was a scam, so I told the wife to call the company and find out who shipped it and it was a different courier company based in the UK. After a bit of digging and investigating it turns out that it's our rebounder. They had shipped it from the UK, via a local carrier, to the brown uniformed guys to deliver to us.

Now, my wife and I are both on disability so an additional charge of almost €50 when you're both already on a fixed income is harsh, especially at Christmas so I told her to pay it and I'd deal with the retailer. The first day I called I had to call 3 times being stuck on hold for at least 20 minutes each time but I was patient and polite because I've worked in a call centre before so I knew those people are only doing their job, but I asked to speak to a manager and was promised a call back each time that never happened. The 2nd day was quite similar. The 3rd day I was starting to get annoyed so called back, waiting even longer on hold and finally wasn't taking this shit any longer. I told the rep that all I wanted was the €50 back because our consumer rights in Ireland dictate that a person must be informed of any additional charges on a purchase, at the very latest, by the final checkout screen, and in this case there was nothing to show that, and I could easily replicate that issue by putting the same item in my basket and going all the way to the checkout screen again and there was nothing saying we'd have to pay import charges. The rep was indifferent to the situation but tried to ""help"" and what he said sent me over the edge. He offered me a measley €20 gift voucher to use on their website, but more importantly he read a statement to me. He said ""we advise our customers that there may be DDU charges (Delivery Duty Unpaid, i.e. customs charges) on any item that gets shipped outside of the UK."" Then I asked him where it states this information and he paused, then said he didn't actually know. I said ""Well I know 1 thing, it doesn't say it anywhere on this transaction because I've checked and because this is a violation of my consumer rights i'm going to give your company 1 last chance to make this right. Have your manager call me within the next 60 minutes or I'm going to post this entire debacle on LinkedIn and link every senior officer in your company!"" Then I hung up the phone and waited....... Yet again, no call.

The next day I went on LinkedIn and followed through on my promise. I created a post detailing what they had done by sticking us with hidden charges and that they were ignoring our requests for a manager, and everything they said and did. Then I tagged EVERY senior officer at that company from the regional managers, through the European directors, all the way to the CEO, and I shamed them for how they operate their company. This, ladies and gentlemen, was now an act of war.

Shortly after I posted that I noticed that they took down the item from their website in an attempt to hide this but they must have thought in a simpleton that doesn't understand how the internet works. They didn't realise that when you searched for ""rebounder"" on their site, that it shows the item in question so I took a screenshot of that, then another of the item page that was now ""missing"", but then I did a Google cached search for the same page and found a version from 2 days prior happily showing the item. Then I added a comment to my original post highlighting how they were trying to hide it, with the evidence, and trolling them for their heinous behaviour ESPECIALLY at Christmas. Then I tagged and shamed all the senior officers again, and at this point it was really starting to get some attention, not only publicly, but 3 people in ""incognito mode"" viewed my profile....I wonder who they could have been....... So naturally I took a screenshot of the 3 mysterious visitors listed on my profile and did the same thing. Commented on my own post highlighting it and trolling them for their incompetence.

The next morning I got a call from a senior exec at their head office in the UK practically licking my boots with apologies, asking what she can do to make this right. I told her I originally only wanted my €50 back as it wasn't fair, nor even legal, that I had to pay it, but since I had to go to such lengths to get their attention now I wanted my €50 back, a full refund on my entire purchase, AND I wanted to keep the product. That was the only thing that would make this go away. She asked for a couple of hours to fix it and I said ok.

About an hour later I got another call from her again apologising. She asked for my PayPal address where she sent the €50, then she refunded the whole purchase, and she let us keep the product. Obviously I thanked her for her help because at that stage I was just happy it was over, but I'll be fucked if I'll let anyone walk all over my family, even if they are a £58,000,000 annual company.

The most of the story here is, don't take bullshit from anyone.

ProRevenge,Sister wants to walk down the aisle at my wedding. We use that to our advantage,"Here I am, writing this long tale in my honeymoon, but it does feel cathartic to finally type it out, and my husband is more excited about this than the resort drinks, lol Anyway, this is a throwaway because I don't have a reddit account and my husband, the reddit fanatic, said he doesn't want this associated with his main. As to why the reddit guy isn't the one writing this, it's because he said ""since it's my family, I should be the one with the honor of posting the story"", but he is looking over my shoulder to help out.

I'm not a lawyer so I don't know if this works but: I do not give permission for this to be reposted anywhere else

So, I think first it's necessary to give some background, to explain how this behavior reached this level, and why our responses were as they were. It's a long read, I apologize.

So, ever since I could remember, my parents loved my sister more.

I don't mean in subtle ways either. If my sister accused me of something, they'd believe it and punish me. If I accused her, they wouldn't believe. Even if there was undeniable proof, they'd still give her a lesser punishment and try to find a way to scold me in tandem.

My birthday cake had to be a flavor she wanted. Hers did not, and my parents always denied knowing I didn't like that type of cake. They always bought her a bit more than for me. We went to where she wanted, even if it was an event that should be about me.

My sister grew up spoiled and didn't like me, just used me as a punching back. But at first she mostly ignored me. But then it got really bad when we were young teens.

I'm not sure what the cause and effect are, but she found herself with no friends and her behavior got worse. Did her friends move, did they ditch her because she was mean? I don't know, because we were never close and my parents loved to boast about her achievements but never ever mentioned any issues (whereas with me, they loved to bring out any flaws of mine constantly as 'teasing' material). I only knew she had none because we went to the same school and I noticed her no longer walking around with people.

Anyway, she had no friends. I did. I used to be decently popular. My sister realized that and suddenly I stopped being the occasional punching bag to a hated person she needed to take down at all times. She started accusing me of more stuff. She accused my friends of more stuff. My parents stopped allowing me to hang out with anyone, the excuses ranging from ""they're not good people according to your sister"" to ""why are you trying to leave us, why cant you be like your sister and enjoy family time?"".

What saved me from complete isolation was extended family. Most of my family lived in the same hometown, and I got along with my cousins despite some age difference. At one gathering, they invited me over to something (I don't remember what), and I sadly replied I'm not allowed to go anywhere. When asked why, my kid self with no filter replied that it was because I wasn't allowed to have friends since my sister didn't have any.

Well, that reached the adults. Who apparently tore my parents apart. Later I was scolded for lying and grounded (as if I had anywhere to go) for a month. But after that they allowed me some leeway, so it was worth it.

And my sister changed schools. I guess the humiliation of extended family knowing her social status was bad and she demanded to be changed. And my parents immediately obliged, even though it cost them more since the school was further away. But she made friends on the new school. However, she never went back to the previous status quo of mostly ignoring me. I guess having felt the power of how badly she could screw with me, and anger that I told family she had no friends, she never let me go.

My life was still bad. Her friends would come over and bully me and my parents called it light teasing. I never called friends over because my parents were awful hosts to them, or my sister would accuse them of taking stuff and they'd believe it. I did become close to my cousins though, since my parents never dared do any of that to family.

And then I got my first boyfriend. I didn't want to bring him home at all, but my parents insisted. Well, at one point we were separated and he came to find me to tell me my sister was flirting with him. By which he meant, she came over with skimpy clothing, batting her eyelashes really badly and started telling him how bad I was and how good she was. He was irked and ran off to find me.

Of course, my sister told my parents a different tale: that my bf had instead tried to flirt with her, but she naturally refused since how could she do that to me. Guess who my parents believed.

Now, my bf wasn't perfect but... I immediately believed him. For a mean reason. But remember that back then I was a teen and suffering from the unfair bad treatment. I was very resentful and moody and now hated my sister as much as she hated me. With that disclaimer out of the way... let's talk about looks. I hadn't mentioned them yet because they weren't relevant. My parents were/are overweight. And since they liked showing love via food (giving you more food, buying treats etc), my sister was/is also overweight, whereas I was/am not (in fact I've always been kind of skinny because punishment often included no treats or snacks). OBVIOUSLY, weight isn't what matters, personality is. But my sister even then was already rude and spoiled, even her flirting attempts were bad because she never learned to work for anything since she could demand and my parents would deliver. Added to that the fact that she didn't look like some sexy model... even my self conscious teen self didn't believe my bf would try and cheat on me with her.

Anyway, my parents prohibited me from dating such a horrible boy. I did try to keep going in secret but it was hard and the relationship ended. I did get another, but again my sister accused him of flirting with her when he refused her advances. Again my parents believed her. I tried pointing out how this happened again, but they decided that meant I was incapable of making good choices and kept picking bad boyfriends. The relationship couldn't handle the romeo juliet situation, and fizzled out again. I would eventually get called a slut in highschool, as I was fine with making out with boys and such but refused to have relationships. Thankfully it never got back to my sister or parents.

My sister did bring one boyfriend home during all this time. He was paraded with pride, and my parents spent every second telling me how good he was, and why couldn't I be like my sister and find myself someone like that. Until he stopped showing up, and suddenly he was conniving bastard that tricked my sister. Oh well.

And the unequal treatment continued at this time. She had more spending money, her curfews were much better than mine, she was free to go anywhere at anytime while I couldn't. If I pointed it out, my parents would say it's because she's older. But when I reached that age, I still didn't have the same treatment she had, and when pointed out, they'd deny they ever said that or claim it was because I couldn't be trusted like she was (using my sister's accusations against my bf and friends as proof of my bad judgment).

Time goes by, and it's time for my sister to graduate. She was accepted into a college. Not a very well regarded one, and she had no scholarship or anything. Again, because only her achievements were told to me, I don't know which colleges she even tried for, so I can't say how badly she was rejected. I do know her grades were bad in school though, because whenever she got a B we would celebrate (I would usually get good grades but my parents refused to celebrate, claiming since I always got those, what was there to celebrate?). My parents, naturally, made a lot of fanfare and told her they'd pay for everything. I was relieved she'd be going away. Not that it made my life any easier. She'd always come home every other weekend and somehow stuff kept missing from her room or some other issue she'd think of to make my life miserable. My curfews were still strict, etc.

Eventually, my mom came to talk to me about my impending graduation (I'm only a year younger than my sister). She told me since they were paying for my sister's college, they had no money to pay for mine. So it would be ""better"" for me to start working immediately after graduation and waiting until my sister finished uni to see if they could afford something for me. Oh, and if I decided to stay at home, I'd have to pay for all my stuff, part of the bills, and rent.

I pointed out I could get student loans. Mom said yes... except no. That is, because they were so caring towards me, and I had such bad judgement, they would decide if a college was worth my getting in debt or not. I'm not sure how they'd stop me from getting loans, but I didn't ask. Scholarships weren't mentioned. They had no idea what my grades were anymore, and never believed in my capabilities.

Anyway, I didn't bat an eyelid. I simply said okay. My mom clearly didn't expect that and kept pushing. Maybe she hoped I'd throw a tantrum so they'd have an excuse to not ever pay for my college. But I said nothing except I understood their position, thanked them for caring and that was that. My dad later tried the same but I also refused to be emotional.

You see, after a whole lifetime of their terrible parenting, I NEVER had any expectations towards my education. I knew they would find an excuse to not pay for mine and make my life miserable. I never believed they would eventually pay it if I worked and waited for my sister to graduate. I had been preparing for college for a long time. I could barely go out, my friendships were slim, so I had a lot of time to study. And study I did, because I saw college as my only chance to be free.

Well, the time came and I worked my ass off and got a scholarship. Not to anywhere like Ivy league or anything like law or medical school. But it was a good enough course, in a decent college, with a full scholarship. Knowing my sister would hate it and try to stop me via parents, I put my achievement in social media at the same time I told them. Even forced myself to thank them in the post. Now they couldn't forbid me from going, as they'd have to explain to family why not. Initially they were even a little proud and boasting about it.

And then I guess my sister got to them, and they changed gears and even asked me if I was sure I wanted to go. They let slip my sister wasn't doing well in college, and since she was smarter and had better judgement than me, I'd suffer worse. I obviously stuck to my guns. They weren't happy but couldn't do anything.

College was my savior. I started being happy. I still contacted my parents and visited on holidays and such, but since they refused to pay for anything, I could excuse not going a lot due to money. During this time, I avoided introducing any man to them. And my sister stopped going to college (I know she didn't graduate because, again, they'd have made a fanfare about it), moved back home (paying no bills or rent but ""it's different"" my parents said) and started working at the same company as my mom, obviously thanks to my mom pulling strings. This was all sold to me as a source of pride. Oh well.

Almost there I promise!

I met my husband around this time. You know those people that say that ""if I was in X situation, I'd have done something""? My husband is the type that really does. I'm the person that is meek and a doormat in any situation and then can't sleep at night wishing I had done something, had thought of something witty to say etc. I'm the person that can't help but cry when I'm angry. My husband is the guy that claps back immediately. He loves drama, in that he loves to resolve it. He's the guy that if he doesn't immediately reply to a slight, you better start worrying because he won't forgive and forget, he's just stewing something worse for revenge. He's the one that wanted me to post here. And wanted to post on a nuclear revenge board too, but decided what we did wasn't nuclear.

People were baffled I got together with him. But just because I was incapable (thanks to my upbringing probably) of acting like him, it didn't mean I didn't like it. I love that my husband does what I can't. And he treats people well as long as they do the same to him.

When we discussed marriage, we decided we didn't care much about the ceremony due to our budget, as we'd rather spend on a dream trip to Europe for our honeymoon. As for where to do it, since his family was spread out and mine was still mostly concentrated in my hometown, we decided to do it there. We weren't living too far off either, so we could take some long trips during the weekends to manage stuff. Plus there was some work flexibility, so we could say in my hometown for a bit too if needed. We sent out the engagement announcement and the save the date for a few months later.

Well, at this point my parents naturally demanded they meet my man. I wanted to grow a spine and refuse, but was having a hard time. The distance had made me think maybe my parents weren't so bad. Well, my husband looked like I cancelled Christmas when I told him I would at least ensure they were never alone with him. See, he had been getting ready for this. He even bought a high quality recorder he could hide in a pocket to record it all. He was stoked, thinking of all the ways he could refuse my sister's advances, insult her, and then spread the recording of her attempts to my family.

So, off he went alone and excited to meet them. And came back later euphoric. ""Babe! Babe! You won't believe the awful shit they wanted! Babe! We can fuck them over so bad, there's so many possibilities!""

I was confused, and wanted to hear the recording but he, smartly, told me it was better to listen to him first or else I'd misunderstand him.

Well... he went there, and instead of the flirting, my parents and my sister sat him down. After some grumbling about not being okay with him, my judgement etc, they proclaimed they were willing to pay for my wedding... on one condition. My sister would walk down the isle on my wedding first. In a wedding dress.

Their excuses were that it wasn't okay for a younger sister to marry first, so it was only fair if my sister had at least the experience of it. On my venue. With pictures being taken, and the dress, and she'd have a cake later too etc.

My husband will now type his part: hey! vengeaful husband here, hell hath no fury like a prorevenge/instantkarma/nuclearrevenge lurker when his beloved is scorned! That said, as much as my wife (teehee, she's my wife now!!) paints me as this quick witted dude, I admit my neurons all but shortcircuited when those folks legit suggested that shit like some sort of great fucking gift. Even Troy would rather take in the horse a second time, methinks. Alas, after my brain rebooted, I did have a whole ass catalog of insults about to spew out, but something in my soul whispered in my ear like the devil: *string these fucks along*. So I said I needed to think, see how my wife (back then fiance) would react, and then ran out of there before I could give away my nefarious plans.

Back to me, the wife: So, my husband sincerely recounted how my parents wanted even my wedding to be about my sister, with a grin on his face. And had the recording to prove it. I was shocked. The distance had softened how bad they treated me. And I thought even they wouldn't go so far. Thankfully, my husband insisting on the angle of revenge helped me not go to a bad headspace. We had a blast thinking up ways to screw them over this. From ridiculously outlandish to what we thought was feasible.

We then called his much more level headed brother when we decided on a plan. It involved having two venue addresses, giving them the wrong one etc. Well, level headed brother scolded us for it. While he acknowledged he would never be able to convince us from retaliation, he at least showed us something like that would be hard to pull off. Some of our other ideas were also at danger of getting sued.

So we eventually settled for the most benign plan: Act like we agreed, but then hire security and don't let her in.

Obviously, if that was all, it wouldn't be prorevenge.

The rest is all mostly my husband, by he wants me to do the honors so here goes. Just important to mention, everything he did was previously discussed with me, and were our mutual ideas:

He went back to my parents. Said he probed and thought I wouldn't be down with it. However, he didn't see the issue and, not wanting family to fall apart, would be down to helping them do it.

He pointed out I don't like conflict, so if I was surprised with it, I might not throw a tantrum in front of all the people. On the other hand, marriage IS a big thing, so who knew if I'd lash out.

Thus he suggested a compromise: they'd help pay for stuff. This way, I would feel even more pressure to not say anything, as not only would we be public (well, with our families there), but I'd be grateful to the help they gave and that'd mollify me.

He said my parents looked surprised, by my grown sister starting skipping with joy. Literally so, like a kid. So it was accepted.

IMPORTANT: my husband also claimed that due to some bad judgement in boyfriends in the past (These words were all my idea and I'm so so proud of using their words against then lol), I was distrustful and controlling and liked to check his phone and stuff to ensure he wasn't cheating on me. As such, it was imperative that NOTHING of this plan was ever put in any writing. For any discussion pertaining to my sister walking down the aisle before me, he'd go over to their house to talk.

And so began the months of deception. Where my parents and sister thought they were tricking me, and my husband and I were milking them.

How? Well, rather than pay for the wedding than lay low, of course my parents wanted input in everything.

Some stuff that meant a lot to me (the songs and color palette), my husband would convince them to let it go to ""keep me in line"". But since we never really cared for the ceremony to begin with, everything else was game... or so they thought.

What we did was thus: we'd go, say, to check the drink and menu options. We'd then accept the lowest or second lowest priced option. My husband would then ""secretly"" take my sister there to also try it out, then sigh and say it's a pity we don't want to abuse my parents goodwill so we wouldn't get the best options.

Cue my sister demanding my parents pay for the best. My parents would then tell me not to worry and they'd pay for the most expensive. Same was done with photographer.

Flowers: My husband handed my sister a bouquet of the flowers we wanted, then sadly expressed how I wanted some other, tasteless flowers. Cue my parents telling me they wanted us to go with said flowers and they'd pay for it.

Wedding dress: we hit a minor snag here. My parents wanted me to use a hideous dress. Okay, not outright hideous, but it wasn't my stile and wouldn't look that good on me. We had planned on saying yes then simply not using it, but my mom sent me a message about it, so there'd be proof I said okay.

We had to go with me refusing in text, and standing my ground. My husband went over there and said he'd ""see what he could do"". My sister suggested ruining my desired dress so I'd be forced to wear the other one. He pretended to agree.

During all this time, they really kept communications outside any text. We made sure that'd happen by, when my sister tried messaging my husband, have me reply to hear. This solidified the ""I'm controlling and neurotic"" claims my husband was making. So they believed it and never risked anything in writing.

(And maybe some people might not like the thought of their partner going around and talking badly about them to family. But I'm such a doormat that the thought of being painting as this controlling and dangerous bitch is extremely funny to me, and I egged him on to do it. I guess I have a warped sense of humor lol)

Oh, and my sister did try to flirt with him, but he acted conflicted.

Also, to really sell that he was with them, my husband would pretend to tell them things without my knowledge.

But he never told them we hired security.

It was really funny. My husband and I, who had sincerely considered a courthouse wedding to focus cost on our honeymoon, having this extravagant, expensive wedding, and barely spending a dime. We called it ""backpay for emotional damages"" from my parents, lol

I think my husband (okay, he just confirmed I'm right lol) was enjoying the whole tricking them more than planning our wedding lol I didn't think it was possible to witness a guy beaming at the thought of wasting his whole Saturday doing a car trip to discuss wedding details with his in laws, but here we are.

Soon the day came. The plan my parents/sister/husband had come up with was: wait until everyone was seated. Since the bride always comes out late, they'd have my sister arrive at that precise time (to avoid me seeing her and trying to stop it), and walk down the isle. By the time I heard what happened, it'd be too late to do anything.

As for my dress: we saved some of the leftover fabric from my dress alterations, and my husband took that to my parents place (sister still lives with them even now), and showed them as proof he'd ruined the dress. Than said he had to go back to me as I was raging and he needed to calm me down, he'd see them at the wedding.

We made sure to keep our actual security hidden at first. As the guests and my parents arrived, all they could see was a woman with a list of names to check. Only after my parents arrived and sat down did we bring out security. A guy that looked like a bodyguard. We told him to not allow anyone my sister in, and even agreed on paying a handsome tip if he didn't reveal we told him that.

Soon the time arrived. My parents got a text my sister was less than 5minutes away, so my dad went and told people to start. My bridesmaids had been told to follow his lead beforehand, so they obeyed without checking with me. After they all went down and took their places, my dad stood up at the entrance, as if waiting for me.

During this, a friend not in the wedding party texted me to get ready. This because if my husband or bridesmaids etc took out a phone and started texting, people might notice. This friend was in on the plan. She's my husband's friend, as willing to help stir drama as he is and didn't care about being a bridesmaid or anything.

Well, as soon as my dad took his position, the bridal song started playing, the doors open and... I come in.

My dad looked aghast at me being there. He tried glancing behind me, but you can't see the venue entrance from where we were, so he couldn't see what happened to my sister.

And then his phone rang, I saw the caller ID and it was her. He just... left me there with a mumbled ""something came up"".

There were gasps and confusion all around. The friend in on it, loudly asked what happened. I lied and in a teary voice said he told me ""it wasn't supposed to be me there"".

(It's not what he said, but my husband and I agreed that if he dared leave me, I should say that to make him look the worst possible. As for the tears, I wish I could say it was just my stellar acting, but no. Despite everything, a part of me didn't think he'd go as far as abandon me there. That the sister thing wasn't true but an elaborate joke. I don't know. I was hurt, still am, so I was sincerely trying not to cry)

The friend then loudly went ""What did he mean by it shouldn't be you???"" so that as many people as possible could hear and spread it, then went ""I Will go and check!"" and ran off. We decided to do this to make her create hell with the security and stop my dad from coming back and stopping the ceremony or something. At some point my mom also left.

At this point, my husband's dad quickly ran over and took my arm. He'd been forewarned he might need to. Watching him run desperately to me helped me smile.

I walked down the isle to whispers as people discussed what happened. Some apparently left to check too. When I reached my husband though, all was well. He made me feel better joking my sad face was so real I deserved an Oscar, and don't worry, he'd rake them over the coals for what they did lol

We got married without a hitch. My parents didn't come back. I did notice a lot of people leaving then coming back during the party, but no one dared tell me what was happening. Someone did come and whisper in my husband's ear and he went out. He came back after a while, with a thunderous expression, but whispered in my ear he needed to go hide somewhere before he broke character and started smiling lol

Well, what happened is... it worked! The following is the summed account from friends, family, the security guy and my husband, that I received afterwards:

My sister did arrive in a wedding dress. The security refused to let her in. Per our agreement, he claimed she must be in the wrong venue because there was already a bride. And yes, we tipped him really well as promised. My dad went there and tried threatening him with police, claiming he never heard of him, so he couldn't be working there. The security agreed to the police, since he was hired by us and doing his job. My dad realized by then it'd be too late and tried to demand he let my sister in.

At this point the friend came over started shouting and insulting my sister and asking what was going on. Basically stalling. My mom soon came and eventually other people.

At this point the wedding plan was bust. All my parents could do now is damage control as everyone that learned about it was aghast they'd try and pull it and screaming and berating them. The three naturally said it wasn't a secret, and threw my husband under the bus.

At this point my husband was summoned. When he came over he put on his best look of confusion and denied, denied, denied. To quote him: gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss lol. He denied having ever agreed to something so ridiculous. When they insisted he did, he demanded proof and of course, they couldn't produce any. All text exchanges they could produce were about normal wedding decisions.

My sister was scream crying and apparently sat on the floor kicking her legs like a kid. My dad looked like he'd beat my husband, but security and other people held him back. Of course, they said they had no proof because my husband told them not to text. My husband laughed and said ""wow, how convenient huh?"" then again repeated why would he EVER agree to something so fucked up. Tore them a new one about being awful parents, then said he wasn't going to let their stupid plans and lying get in the way of his wedding and went back to me.

No one believed them. The venue had cameras but they refused to show me the recording as that was only for security purposes. But some people filmed parts of it. Watching my parents and sister get ripped apart by any and everyone that came out to check the drama was delicious. After years and years of being accused of stuff and not believed, to watch them have a taste was one of the best wedding gifts. My mother was crying, my dad kept changing from purple to white, my sister was still on the floor crying and screaming. They kept insisting on that my husband was in on it. But people kept asking why would my husband agree, why was there no proof, why did they want my sister to do this to my wedding? And they had no good answer to any of it

Eventually they were told to leave and had no choice but to do so. My dad apparently had to drag my sister up as she refused to leave the ground.

Again, people said nothing to me all night. I guess they wanted to spare me. And maybe it's because I was the bride and not just a guest for once, but it did feel like everyone was making extra effort to be nice, positive and excited about everything. My husband says ""all the expensive shit they were eating drinking certainly helps"" lol.

We had a blast. My husband maintained the forced angry face for only a short while before breaking out in smiles again.

After that we went to the hotel to catch some sleep before going to our honeymoon.

(Speaking of which, my parents did try to pay for our plane tickets, but we thought that was risky as they could try and cancel them or something so we refused)

Of course, since that whole thing the three have tried to contact me. I've refused calls, because my husband insisted on keeping a papertrail. I smart thing, because my sister did eventually message me. I won't repeat it as it was very unhinged and didn't make much sense, but the important part was that she blamed me for her humiliation, called my husband a two faced snake that fooled them for months (he wants to print and put that on our wall lol) and hoped (but was also certain it'd happen) that I'd get cheated on by him. She did also suggest he was cheating on me with her, actually.

My husband took my phone, screenshot the call logs, screenshot my sister's message, screenshot some messages of my parents demanding I pick up the phone... and sent it all to my family group chat. And sent screenshots of messages to him, where they called him names and threatened him (but he kept up the ""you're delusional, I never agreed to anything"" shtick, and even threatened to sue them for defamation and harassment). He wrote a message in said group chat begging my family for help, as I was now being harassed by them constantly. He begged family to help stop them from trying to ruin my honeymoon now that they had failed to ruin my wedding. Then finished neatly with a request that they don't share our locations, to avoid my parents sending my sister over and then claiming he had somehow agreed to pretend to fuck her in our honeymoon suite. LOL. My family assured him they'd take care of it.

And indeed, since then we've had silence. My husband is a little disappointed my sister didn't disobey, so he could tattle again while tearing her a new asshole. We'll see if it'll last.

All in all, while I obviously would preferred to have a normal loving family at my wedding, at least for once in my life they not only failed to ruin something meaningful to me, but I got them back.

\*\*\*

Extra info:

Do I know why they treat me like this? I've been asked this question a lot so I assume you all will think the same. I have wondered this all my life, and I still don't know. I tried asking when I was young, but they denied any difference and scolded me for acting spoiled, so I quit trying. I've thought of some many possibilities, but based on my observations I think it's this: I was unplanned. They took a while to have my sister, so she was not only wanted but also like a miracle child after so long. However, given our age difference is quite small... I think they didn't expected to have a kid so soon or easily, and didn't use adequate protection way too soon after my sister's birth. And maybe didn't notice my mom was pregnant until too late. So they were saddled with an unplanned baby while still dealing with a newborn. And they're not that well off, so having the extra expense likely didn't help. So they resented me. But that's my conjecture. Regardless, I've accepted the answer won't truly matter: what they did to me was unwarranted no matter what.

Did they really think this would work? My husband and I talked, and we have the theory that they never wanted to do this at all. We think my sister threw a tantrum over me getting married first when she barely gets dates, and they gave my husband that outlandish proposition. As in, they didn't want to pay for my wedding and didn't think we'd accept or that it'd even look good for them to do it. But by suggesting it and being refused, they could look like the good guys to my sister while having an excuse to not give me a dime. But then my husband accepted it, and they couldn't backtrack, or else risk my sister turning on them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(edited to fix some typos)

**SUMMARY because it did get too long:** bad parents want to have my sister walk down the aisle at my wedding first, in wedding dress and all. My husband pretends to go along with it, and uses this as an excuse to get my parents to pay for the most expensive stuff possible for my wedding (which they only did because they thought it would be for my sister's sake). When the day comes though, we hired security that didn't let her in. When family called out my parents, they said my husband was in on it. But my husband denied it. There was no evidence, so  no one believed them. So now family is against them, no one believes them, my sister didn't ruin my wedding and we got a lot of money out of them

ProRevenge,Operation Let it Go,"My dad just shared a story about my late Uncle Dale (his lifelong friend and fellow engineer). So in his memory and in spirit of the upcoming holidays, I present for you the tale of nepotism, engineering students and Idina Menzel.

Uncle Dale was a senior engineer at a small firm in the Midwestern USA and engineering instructor at the local community college. He was also (unofficially) in charge of the office parties. To help offset the costs, he had a small tin box on a table outside of his office with a slot in it so anyone could donate money to the party fund. Everyone knew about it and were happy to donate. A month or so before before the company's big Christmas party, Uncle Dale decided to check the box.

Low and behold; it was empty.

Uncle Dale knew something was wrong because he had seen several colleagues putting money in the box. This could only mean one thing: someone was stealing from the party fund.

At this moment, Brad, the owner's nephew and a fellow engineer, came around the corner...and something about the way Brad was looking at him made Uncle Dale suspicious.

Brad didn't have a good reputation around the office to say the least. He had a reputation of being pushy, obnoxious, rude and just plain entitled. Unfortunately, he was not only the owner's ""beloved nephew"" but knew how to skirt the rules so he wouldn't get fired.

Uncle Dale decided to set a trap to catch the thief. Using his engineering skills, he set up a hidden rig using a hidden doorbell camera right by the box. He then had a colleague loudly brag about how he contributed $100 to the party fund. Then he waited.

He got a notification that the camera was recording...and watched Brad open the empty box, scowl in disgust and throw the box against the wall.

Now you'd think this would end with Uncle Dale presenting the video evidence to his boss to get Brad fired but oh no.

As I mentioned in a previous post, ""if there's one thing engineers love, it's solving problems. And if it's engineering students, they'll make it an experience to remember.""

Uncle Dale then went to his engineering students. He offered them extra credit to come up with a rigged box that would make noise when opened. The more obnoxious the sound, the higher the bonus. 

One week later, they delivered their project and demonstrated how it worked. Pleased with the results, Uncle Dale awarded them the extra credit as promised. The next day, he set up the rigged box and proclaimed ""Well! Isn't this nice! Someone donated $50 to the party fund!"" Then he went to his office and waited.

The engineering students had rigged the box with one of those inserts from cards that play music when you open them. By popular vote, they had picked ""Let it Go"" from the Disney movie ""Frozen""...right around the time the song was beginning to become unpopular. They also managed to ensure that once opened, the box couldn't close unless you pressed a hidden side button releasing the hinge...so the song would continue to play. For extra funsies, they made sure to angle the insert for maximum volume AND secured it down with industrial strength glue.

Sure enough, everyone in the office heard Idina Menzel belting the hated song and Brad's frustrated grunts while trying to close the box. One of those attracted by the sound was Brad's uncle. Finally, Brad chucked the box at the wall, managing to put a good sized dent in it. The uncle then summoned Brad to his office. Fifteen minutes later, Brad left with a cardboard box and cleared out his desk...along with a note in his file ""do not rehire. do not recommend"". So his engineering career was over.

That Christmas, Uncle Dale had a little video prepared to show at the party. The doorbell camera had caught Brad's attempt to steal from the box...all to the tune of ""Let it Go.""",3319,0.99,100,AQuietBorderline,2023-12-18 14:40:35,18lixxu,3419,High
ProRevenge,"Hell Hath no Fury Like Me Scorned - Part II, Felony Boogaloo","Hello, r/ProRevenge!  A couple of years ago, I posted a revenge story involving my step-mother Shanty Wife, my step-brother Shorty, and my dad, who is now resting in a purple urn.  In case you missed it, [you can read it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/qvov5v/hell_hath_no_fury_like_me_scorned_also_posted_on/)  Well, I finally have an update!

To recap, Shorty, my step-brother, was my dad's Power of Attorney while he was sick and had heinously abused his position, stealing a very large sum of money.  When I got involved, I got a restraining order against Shorty, filed charges, took over my dad's care, and exacted some sweet revenge in the process.  I was warned by the court's Victim's Advocate, who is my first cousin because that's how it is in that town, that bringing Shorty to trial for what he did would take a very long time.  She was correct.

In the meantime, I monitored Shorty's online activities.  When he moved out of state, I called the court and let them know just in case it violated his bail.  When he got a job as a truck driver, I called the court to let them know he was repeatedly leaving his home state just in case it violated his bail.

Then, six months ago, I got a call from the same victim's advocate.  The trial was going to be set soon, and the court wanted input from the family regarding possible plea deals and sentencing.  He was indicted on felony elder abuse and was facing 15 years in prison.  The advocate let me know that the family could request prison time, or plea him down to work release with restitution.  The upside to prison was obvious, but the downside would be that we would not likely receive restitution since he'd be perpetually poor and in prison.  With work release, we would receive restitution, but he would have his freedom.  Somewhat.  She wanted to know which we preferred.  I asked for the night to think it over.

Shorty's future rested in my hands and I wanted to savor it.  What kind of god did I want to be?  To decide, I needed to do some math.  If he went to prison for 15 years, he would be out in half or less.  Seven years is a long time.  But restitution would surely take as long if not longer, and I would get the pleasure of taking his money every month, for years and years and years.  I liked the thought of him working every day, toiling away in shit conditions for shit pay and him knowing that a portion of that shit day would be for nothing.  I *loved* the thought that I would be the reason for it.

So I called her back and told her we would be OK with a plea deal to felony supervised release and restitution.  I didn't hear anything further until last week, when the advocate called me again to let me know he'd accepted a deal.

The Deal:

He plead guilty to felony elder exploitation, 1st degree.  He received 15 years, split and suspended which means he won't serve any jail time. Two years will be on felony work supervision where he'll have to call in to his parole officer every day and be drug tested almost as frequently.  After that, he'll be on regular probation for up to five years.  The judge will schedule check-ins with him to ensure he's paying restitution and  meeting the requirements of his work release and parole.

The Restitution:

He has to pay back $130,539.39.  He was ordered to pay $300 a month beginning 01/01/2024.  My math gamble paid off; it will take him 36 ***years*** to pay that back at $300 a month.  If he misses a payment, he will go to jail.  I will be in his life for decades, taking back from him bit by bit what he stole.

So I think that's going to be it.  I've done everything I can do, apart from being there to catch him if he violates the terms of his release.  Thank you for reading this tangled web of revenge.  I hope it warms your heart for the holidays!",3748,0.98,256,MNWNM,2023-12-13 11:51:02,18hmmk5,4004,High
ProRevenge,TIFU by being an AH on internet and causing a stranger to get divorced.,"I’m crossposting this from TIFU. I’m really not a mean person and genuinely felt terrible for destroying a marriage. But the lovely users thought I should post here though I didn’t mean for the revenge to go to this level by any means. I don’t even know if I meant for revenge at all… but here we are. 


I (42 F) TIFU big time. 2 weeks ago on a random Thursday morning at like 1AM someone starting shooting off fireworks in my neighborhood. I’ve been having bouts of insomnia and was finally able to get to sleep and I had to get to wake up at 4AM for a meeting 2 hours away that I had to be at for 8AM. I was pissed and so we’re my dogs. I love fireworks but think there’s a time and a place. Thursday morning at 1AM is not it. 

I posted to the neighborhood fb group a few hours later during a coffee break about people that set off fireworks at 1AM mid-week.

After I make the long drive home, I check my fb. Some guy comments that I can’t sleep because I’m a fat pig. Now, I’m chubby but not sloppy fat. Plus I just lost the equivalent of a fully grown male wombat, or 54 North American grey squirrels, so I feel fucking awesome about myself. 

This is where I may have really fucked up…

I respond to the guy, who was maybe mid to late 30’s/very early 40’s. About the same age group as me. I write in a comment beneath his, “Listen *guys name* I’m sorry I had to end things, but I just didn’t have the same feelings. What you’re saying now is just hurtful and mean. Please stop sending me messages and commenting on my fb posts is just a pathetic way to contact me. I told you a dozen times already, we are done. It’s over.”  

The following day I had to get to the airport for an out of country vacation that had me getting up early and leaving early as hell… so I don’t check my fb during all the craziness (also because I’m only on it sparingly. I don’t live on my phone and when I am, I’m usually on Reddit or TikTok vs FB).  

I could not check my fb even if I wanted. I was on a cruise- not paying $25/day for internet and the country we visited didn’t really have the greatest Wi-Fi. Besides I was having a blast leaving the chaos of the world behind. 

I signed on Monday night and FUCK. Apparently, people took this seriously and told his wife! She was freaking out on me, pleading for information. Sending me messages. Her and his friends were DMing me. He was DMing me. It was bad. 

The last message was the guy saying I’m a total cunt because I refused to tell the truth and I just destroyed his life. I immediately message both him and his wife explaining what happened. I sent pics of me on vacation even - time stamped. 

Apparently, he is a serial cheater and when I exposed our affair, another woman exposed her affair with the husband to the wife because AP was jealous that he had yet another side chick. This was the straw that broke the camel’s back because not only of the multiple affairs, but because he humiliated her with how public it was (especially it being a neighborhood group).

So there’s my accidental pro revenge. 

TLDR; someone tried to hurt my feelings after I posted about fireworks being set off early morning, and I pretended to publicly address our “breakup”… his wife and affair partner were not pleased.",8653,0.97,433,crazymastiff,2023-11-01 21:36:34,17ltip3,9086,High
ProRevenge,When your racket with the local cops bites you in the ass internationally.,"This happened a few years ago when I was serving overseas with the US military.  

The location I was at, was in a poorer area.  There's a fair number of panhandlers, a lot of petty crime, and just people doing stupid crap.

Well one racket that goes on in this area and apparently in other areas of the country too, is the local cops incentivize reporting vehicles without of date inspection stickers.  Apparently they give these people access to the inspection database if they think the sticker is fake or stolen which actually does happen.  If you drive a motorcycle, one of the things they tell you when you in-process is to keep the sticker in your wallet and not on the vehicle or else it'll just get peeled off.  Anyway what these people will do if they find a car with an out-of-date sticker or if they run the plates and find it's out of date they will jimmy the door open, steal every single thing out of the car and leave a note that they've taken it to the police station.  The idea is that you show up at the police station to get your stuff and they force you to pay the fine for an overdue sticker and then give you a deadline for an inspection or else you'll get another fine.  

Well I came out to my car one morning and lo and behold there was a note on my seat saying that all my stuff was at the local police station because my inspection sticker was fake and I had to go get it.  No not only am I late for work my kid is also going to be late for school because there's no bus and I have to drive her every morning on my way.  Also my inspection sticker is not out of date so I have no idea what's going on.  Now here's the thing that was extremely problematic was I had put my passport and my wife/kid's in the glove box because I was taking them to the base to get some paperwork done.  As well as grab some paperwork for my wife to apply for a new passport because hers was expired.  I'm very forgetful so I put them in the night before and made sure the car was locked.  Yeah dumb mistake...  

Anyway I get to the station, ask them what the heck was going on, and then when I have them look at the inspection documents that the guy had taken which clearly stated the car had been inspected and was current they apologized and told me that they would give my things back and I had to wait there for a second.  I asked to file a police report for theft but they looked at me like I had three heads and told me nothing was stolen even though somebody broke into my car and took my things.  

This is when a light bulb went off in my head and this might fall into the unethical category.  The guy had taken official US passports which might be a problem but probably nothing would come of it since they were turned right in to the police.  However, I asked him where my wife's passport was.

They told me that whatever is there is there.  I said I needed a police report because I needed to contact the US embassy about a stolen passport and the fact that this police station would know exactly who the person was that stole it because they had dropped off my things that morning.

I have never seen someone's attitude change as quickly as that cop's attitude changed.  He tried to talk me out of filing a police report but I was pretty insistent so I went ahead with the police report and then I did contact the embassy and reported the passport stolen and gave them all the information of the police station and when I got the police report I emailed it to them as well.  

Wound up getting a free passport out of it for my trouble.  The embassy told me they were going to handle it and from what I heard the person who broke into my car actually got arrested and fined and was looking at additional charges because he stole foreign documents.  Really would have liked to have been a fly on the wall when one of the local cops rolled into wherever he was at and told him to come with them.  

I don't feel bad at all.  Hopefully dude learned his lesson and I did not have any further issues until I PCSd home.

ProRevenge,"Stepdad cheats on my mom, so we get revenge","Initials for clarity:

Me(24m): me
My mother(50f): mom
My brother (23m): bro
My sister (30f): sis
Cheating stepdad(45m): Chris
Stepdad's coworker(25f): Betty
The other woman(~40f): Darla

This may be a long one, apologies in advance.

I moved in with my mom after her marriage of 25 years with my bio dad was ended.  He was a manipulative asshole, but that's another story.

Shortly after the divorce, my mom introduced me to her boyfriend at the time, Chris.  Now, my mom worked as a correctionals officer at the county jail.  The boyfriend was a former inmate, in for a DUI.  That should have been the first red flag, but my mom was grieving a long marriage, and I didnt want to push the subject.  Chris seemed to make her happy, and that was enough for me.

Me, bro and sis all moved in with mom and Chris, and we seemed get along ok.  Chris and I bonded a bit over our loved of video games, and all seemed well.  That is, until 2017.

Due to Chris's prior DUI, he had to go in regularly for probationary check ups at the court house.  One day, he didnt return, and we got a little worried.  We then recieved a phone call from him, from TEXAS.

Turns out, when he arrived at the courthouse that day, he was jumped by the FBI.  His family from Texas was implicated on a number of gang and drug related crimes, and due to a situation where he was in a vehicle during a drug handoff, he was on the hook as well.  He ended up agreeing to testify against his family members in exchange for a shorter sentence, and allowed to be out of prison before the trial.

My mom was distraught, and over the course of many phone calls over a year, they worked out their marriage plans when he returned.  His store owner at the DQ he worked at allowed him to come back as well, back to his store manager position.

Soon after, the drinking started.

Now obviously, because of his DUI, Chris was clearly no stranger to drinking.  He began to drink more and more, to the point where he was consuming half a 24 pack of beer a day.

Chris was a mean drunk.  He regularly started fights when wasted, and while they never got physical, he wasnt exactly kind with his words.  My mom enabled his behavior for several years, saying the stress was getting to him from work and from the upcoming trial.

Finally, after several years, my mom had enough.  Chris came home extremely drunk one night, and my mom confronted him.  She asked if he'd been drinking, and when he didnt deny it, she kicked him out.  He went to live with a friend temporarily.  The next morning, mom asked us to help gather a few of his essentials so that he didnt have to reenter the home until he was sober.

While we were gathering his things, we heard a knock at the front door.  We opened it to find Betty, one of Chris's coworkers and someone I went to high school with.  She told my mom she had something important to share.  

After sitting my mom down and telling her not to share where she got the info from, Betty told my mom about how Chris was cheating on my mom with Darla.  How he regularly had Darla perform sexual acts in and around his workplace.  How Betty had caught them, and how Chris told her that if she ever told my mom, he'd fire her (he WAS the store manager).  And finally... how Darla was pregnant.

My mom was angry.  After the initial shock wore off, she told us to round up ALL of Chris's things, and to dump it outside.  We took everything of his out of the house and tossed it all in the alley behind our house. Chris had no reason or ability to return to the house (it was rented, with only my mom on the paperwork, so no issues there).  In the meantime, she called and confronted him.

He confessed to the entire affair, and that he was happy Darla was pregnant because that meant he'd finally have a child of his own (mom refused to have more kids, we three were massive strains on her body, she likely wouldn't survive any more).  He refused to apologize for any of his actions.  My mom arranged for him to collect his items from the alley (with an officer present), and he left our lives.

--The revenge--

Now, my mom clearly wanted to dust her hands of him and move on.  She was already quite emotional from the whole ordeal, and wanted nothing more from him.  But sis, bro, and I had other ideas.

First, we called his workplace.  DQ operates as an independently owned franchise, and the owner of this branch owned several branches in the area.  He was also a good friend.  We informed him of the sexual acts being performed on the premises, and he went the the processes of getting Chris booted from his position, and barred him from any of the branches in the area. (Funnily, Betty got his position after he left, and now runs a tight and clean ship.)

Chris no longer had a job or a place to live, and so went to live with Darla in a town about an hour away.  We found out that he started working at another DQ in THAT town, and informed the owner of that location of the situation. It took significantly longer, due to there being no current indecent actions occurring there, but eventually he lost that job too.

Soon after, Chris began driving around our neighborhood, seemingly stalking my mom and our family, probably because of his job loss.  Now, due to the whole situation in Texas, he never had his probation lifted for his DUI, and thus still did not have a license.  He never had to drive when he lived with us, since work was local and we could drive him as needed.  But here was was, clearly driving around by himself when he shouldn't be.

We contacted the police and informed them about Darla's vehicle in our neighborhood, and that we believed Chriswas driving it, without a license.  We told them to pull over the vehicle next time they see it, as it would likely be C driving again.  Sure enough, a few weeks later, we were told that Chris indeed was pulled over, and sent back to the local jail for driving without a license, and while intoxicated.

The police also did a search of the home he was staying at, and found several guns at the premises.  Since he was a felon, he was not legally allowed to have weaponry on the premises, meaning there was more jail time tacked on.  By the time his hail time had finished, it was just in time for him to be sent back to incarceration in Texas for the trial.

Chris's son was born while Chris was in prison.  Darla evidently realized what an absolute ass Chris was, and cut ties with him while he was in prison.  During his prison time, Chris started sending tons of letters to my mom, stating how sorry he was, pleading to take him back, and ranting about how it wasnt his fault (all in the same letter, mind you).  Mom burnt every one of them.  We moved on, moving out of state.

Chris evidently got out of prison some years ago, and now lives in Kansas, struggling and fighting child support, which Darla sued him for.  Mom now has a new boyfriend, who treats her right and cares a lot more than Chris ever did.  Bro and sis moved on and out, and I still live with mom, assisting her with the newly purchased home that we've been renovating.  Lifes looking ok.  I was reminded of this by a chat with a coworker about cheaters, and thought to post it here for others to enjoy.

ProRevenge,Deliberately deplete my prepaid phone balance? You will pay for it one thousand times over.,"I went to middle school in the early 2010s, right before smartphones really took off. I got my first phone right before starting sixth grade, it was a slide phone with a pay as you go plan that cost $0.10 per minute for calls and per text message sent or received. Worse yet, sending or receiving photos cost $0.25 each. It was very expensive, and my parents only gave me $100 a year for this, if I exceeded the amount, I had to cover the rest with my limited birthday and Christmas money I had. Fortunately, most of my friends were good about helping me preserve the balance. They would call and I’d let the call drop but immediately call back on a landline so it wouldn’t count as a call, and they’d email me or message me on skype for most things.  
  
Everything was good until Derek joined the group in seventh grade. At first we thought he was funny, but we quickly got fed up with him as he was very unpleasant and exhibited many antisocial behaviors. He started drama within the friend group and also caused issues between us and other kids outside of the group. He was manipulative and always played the victim when others rightfully called him out on his shit, and he knew how to charm parents, so getting rid of him was easier said than done. He was the one friend who didn’t respect my phone situation. He very frequently texted me dumb memes, even though I told him multiple times to just email or skype them to me instead since picture text messages cost $0.25 each. Unfortunately, blocking phone numbers was a feature that was unavailable for this pay as you go plan, so there was nothing I could do as he spammed my phone. One day he got mad at me for some reason and spammed my phone with memes. He must’ve sent me over 100 lolcats over text, he kept sending them until I lost service since my phone balance was depleted. I had lost the $40 remaining in my account as a result. I was extremely pissed and demanded that he pay me the $40 he had cost me, and he refused and said it wasn’t his problem. I got home from school really upset and told my dad about the situation, expecting him to go and tear Derek’s mother a new one and demand the money, but my dad said that it wasn’t worth the battle. I even asked him about a small claims court but he said that not all battles are worth fighting, and that the effort wasn’t worth $40. He took me to the carrier’s store and loaded $50 onto the phone. The carrier changed my phone number, and they managed to block Derek’s number. They had initially said that blocking phone numbers wasn’t possible with this plan, but my dad insisted and would not leave the store until they did it. I was extremely paranoid about my phone number being leaked and other kids spamming it to fuck with me. Fortunately, my parents got iPhones that summer and got me one too, and the new family plan had an unlimited text plan. Nonetheless, I was pissed at the $40 he essentially stole from me out of malice. Fortunately, not too long after, there was a big blowout between Derek and the rest of the friend group at the end of the school year and we permanently kicked him out of the group. He was an outcast the following year in 8th grade, nobody was tolerating his shit anymore, and he changed schools the year after and we never heard from him again.  
  
Fast forward to a few years ago, I was back home for a few months between graduating college and starting a new job on the other side of the country. I went out to some garage sales one Saturday morning and I ended up at Derek’s house. I recognized his mother, but I don’t think she recognized me, I guess glasses and a beard is all you need. I noticed some Pokemon napkins out for sale, and when I picked them up to look at them, Derek’s mom said that her son had been obsessed with Pokemon for his whole life and that she was tired of Pokemon stuff occupying her home for so many years. I said that these napkins were for my younger cousin who is really into Pokemon, and asked if she had any more Pokemon stuff. She said she didn’t know people were still into that and that there were a few boxes in the attic with her son’s old stuff. She actually took me inside the house (which I never imagined I’d set foot inside ever again), and let me climb up the attic ladder and take down several large boxes to look through. The first one had Christmas ornaments in it and other junk, but I freaked out inside when she opened a box jam packed with Pokemon video games in the original boxes, though I kept my cool on the outside.  
  
The whole reason I had agreed to go inside in the first place was because I was holding out hope of this exact scenario happening. See, I knew Derek was obsessed with Pokemon. Our friend group liked Pokemon back in the day even when other kids thought it wasn’t cool, but Derek was on a whole different level. He bragged about his Pokemon collection all the time, at the time he had every single main series game in the original box, and in “mint condition” as he always had to add in. I went to his house once and he was showing me his collection, he yelled at me for touching one of the games, nobody was allowed to touch them except him. He had many older Nintendo games in excellent condition but Pokemon was his favorite. He had had a couple of incidents with his mom damaging or throwing away his things, it wasn’t out of malice but just ignorance, as she didn’t think the games or collectibles had any value. Fast forward into the present day, I was thinking about this when I asked his mother if she had any other Pokemon stuff, she ended up bringing out the motherload.  
  
We opened all of the boxes she had me bring down. Within the boxes there was the beloved collection of Pokemon games, all very well preserved, as well as several Nintendo consoles, hundreds of games, two dozen binders full of Pokemon cards, and there was also a box of many Lego sets with the original boxes and everything, with many old Star Wars sets. When I saw Jango Fett I knew I struck gold. I told her that I liked old Legos as well, and asked her how much for the five boxes of games, cards, and lego sets, and she thought for a second and said $100 a box, or $400 for all five. I told her I would take it all and hauled ass to get to an ATM. I loaded the five boxes into my dad’s truck and immediately drove home. I knew there was potentially tens of thousands of dollars of goods here, this was the score of a lifetime and I finally felt vindicated for the $40 Derek had taken from me all those years ago.  
  
I ended up giving all the stuff to my uncle, who’s a hobbyist ebay reseller. He offered to sell it all, he was willing to go through the effort and sell everything individually, and despite my insistence he said he wouldn’t take more than a 10% cut of the profits after all fees and taxes. We went through and logged every single item along with the estimated value, and the total of the whole lot was about $40,000. 40,000 was a poetic number since this was 1000x the value of what Derek stole from me all those years ago.

ProRevenge,Boss from HELL gets what she deserves,"I (30sF), have been a people pleaser to a fault my whole life. I have been working in marketing for 10+ years. Over the years, I've had my fair share of bosses who were good, average, and some who sucked. There is one in particular that stood out as awful. This story is from about 5+ years ago.

Pamela (40s- not real name) was the VP of Marketing and Sales for a mid-size retailer. She started at the company a few years after I did. And if rumors were true, she was the fourth pick for the position and was simply hired so the company could appease shareholders.  

I was a manager under her, and my whole job was to make sure the website and stores had their products merchandised properly, received all their monthly sales materials, managed advertising, set up and managed the department's budget, PM'd all department projects and operations, created reporting to reflect sales, managed presentations/creative briefs for future projects etc. In short, I did her work and all the administrative grunt work to keep the department afloat. I managed all this because I had access to her email and many times sent emails on her behalf to keep the department functioning. Pamela spent most of her time showing up after 10am, taking ""business lunches"", and planning company parties (don't even know why we did those, but I planned those too.) 

I consistently questioned why she spent so much of our budget on these events when we didn't have the budget resources for any of it. Pamela told me to take from future months' budgets to pay for the current month's overspending. So, at the start of every month, I had an original budget and by the end of the month, I had to turn in an edited budget (edited under Pamela's direction) that made it look like Pamela's spending was under control. **This is important for later.**

I definitely made mistakes here and there being in charge of so many tasks and constantly found myself working 12 hour days split between being in the office and working after my kid went to bed. Weekend work was also done before my family woke up and after they went to bed. 

During Pamela's first major holiday season, sales were shit. Pamela kept changing her mind on the visuals for the stores, kept bringing on new advertising and PR agencies to ""bring in sales"" (all these agencies consisted of her personal friends), and ignored our buying/merchandise team's planned promotions for her own ""better"" ones. 

At this time, I had been dealing with an ongoing infection that turned to sepsis, and was hospitalized. The doctors and my husband said it was due to the stress of work and that I needed to take a break. 

As I recovered, I realized how much I was hurting myself, my family, and even the company I worked for. Eventually, my old habits got to me, and I got on my phone and checked mine and my bosses emails. What I found made my blood boil.

First, I got a lovely bouquet of flowers from upper management wishing me well, and I knew that Pamela organized the delivery (she sent me *her* favorite flowers.) I went to her inbox to put the receipt in the correct folder to send to accounting when I got back. At the top of her inbox from the past 3 days were emails clearly not related to business. What I found in her emails was Pamela emailing her *personal friends* griping on how I can't just *shake off sepsis* and ""get back to work"". She also complained that she couldn't find any of my notes, spreadsheets, or documents for any of the work *she* was technically in charge of (they were on our shared drive labeled very clearly.) Finally, I found an email where she sent a friend from a previous company asking for advice on how to bring in sales and save her job. 

In this long thread, this old colleague asked if there was anyone managing most of the work, and of course, Pamela said I was. This colleague explained that clearly it was my mismanagement that was causing issues and that I could be blamed if sales didn't pull through by the end of the season. Pamela mentioned that I was in the hospital and repeated comments from her other email thread. This person said that she couldn't outright fire me because it could seem like retaliation because I needed to take emergency medical leave. But, if Pamela could prove I was stealing from the company or misusing company resources, then she would have grounds to have me fired (and use me as a scapegoat).

Upon my return, Pamela called me into her office and said she was ""worried I was taking on too much"", and wanted to take work off my plate. She announced was taking managing the department budget off my plate. She asked me to only drop of a small stack of invoices to accounting. Additionally, Pamela told me under *no circumstances* was I allowed to talk to accounting about anything regarding budgets. Also, if I had any concerns about the department or workload, I wasn't allowed to go to HR, I had to discuss it directly with Pamela. Oh yeah, I could see where this was going. 

Unfortunately for Pamela, I had built a rapport with Lois (50s - not real name) who was our main accountant. Lois always said that she would do everything in her power to help me should I ask. 

Knowing this, I grabbed the stack of invoices off Pamela's desk to give to accounting. I also added the email threads I read while I was in the hospital, and the current *unedited* budget that Pamela hadn't touched yet for the month. I also found in my filing cabinet the hard copies of old budgets with Pamela's handwriting on *what numbers to change* to balance our budget. Finally, I added an email from our first round of budget adjustments where Pamela subtlety threatened to put someone else in my job if I couldn't do what she asked.

So, I walked and dropped off the invoices to accounting when I bumped into Lois. She brought up invoices, and I sternly looked at her and said Pamela is the only one in our department that Lois is allowed to talk to about our budget and invoices. Lois saw the suspiciously thick file folder on her desk, gave a firm nod, and lovingly kicked me out of her office. 

Within the week, Pamela was fired. From what I understand, she has been continually job hopping for the past few years. The CEO (and HR) brought me in to personally apologize for everything I went through and gave me a paid 1-week vacation to take at my discretion. Given other issues with this business, I left after another year.

Which brings me to today. I am, once again, a manager for sales and marketing. I have a wonderful boss (Mike - 40s M), who trusts my business decisions and backs me up on practically everything. We are hiring my team for me to soley manage and direct. 

Today, I looked through the applicants and found Pamela's resume sitting among dozens of others. I stared at her name, wondering how many other people share her name. Upon review, yup, it's her. She definitely fell down the corporate ladder, with VP of our old company being the highest title she earned. And, to no surprise, she embellished her achievements, claiming the work I managed as her own, and claimed she generated an 87% sales growth during the holiday season at our previous company.

As a people pleaser, who firmly believes in giving everyone a chance, it has never been so satisfying to click ""Disqualified"".

Edit: To those suggesting I interview her to see her reaction, I **would have loved** to see her face as she walked in. But, I felt it would have risked my boss's trust in my decision-making ability. 

Maybe I'll send a personally written rejection email",4789,0.98,101,Present_Platypus_578,2023-10-12 15:28:00,176gkp8,4890,High
ProRevenge,Revenge on a client who tried to throw me under the bus,"I was pushing forty, and I'd learned a lot of lessons in more than ten years of legal practice. But one of the most important lessons I learned was from an older lawyer that I worked for as a summer student, after the second year of law school.

""A lawyer has three duties,"" he told me, ""first to himself, second to the court, and last, the client. Always make sure you come first, and the client comes last."" The reason? ""Because clients will fuck you,"" he said, ""they'll throw you under the bus without thinking twice."" I should have stayed with this lawyer, but being young and an idiot, I had to go work downtown, and I'm still downtown now, but fortunately for me, I remembered this lesson, and it came in handy many years later when a client really did try to throw me under the bus.

My client was this mid-sized company that did this and that and owned things here and there, not big enough to be listed, but it did have a pretty sizable real estate portfolio, and one day a building they owned burned to the ground. The company wanted to collect on the insurance, so they told Frank, a veteran salaryman, to deal with it.

Frank was close to sixty and thought he knew what he was doing. He didn't need me to help him with the insurance claim, he told me; he had everything under control. Besides, lawyers are expensive. Some guys really get off on not paying legal fees, and Frank was one of those guys who gloated over every penny that he managed not to pay to the lawyers. I dealt with Frank a lot, and he was always nickel and diming me.

""The insurer is going to fuck you,"" I told Frank. It was only by luck that I even knew about the fire and the loss because Frank had not asked for my help; he'd just let it slip one day, and since then, I'd kept on top of him, trying to get him to smarten up. I'd had to fight to get him to send me the proof of loss form to make sure he hadn't messed that up. Frank fucked up a lot, and I wondered sometimes how he had a job. But the proof of loss  was okay, at least, so that was one less thing to worry about.

""You don't know that,"" he said. I could tell he just wanted to get me off the phone.

""I'm paid to know when insurers are trying to screw my clients,"" I said, ""and the insurer is going to screw you. They've been stringing you along for ages with requests and questions and paperwork, but they aren't going to pay you. Not unless you sue them."" But Frank said he knew what he was doing, that it was all under control, and besides, he got along with the adjuster so great.

""The limitation period expires in two weeks,"" I said, ""and once that two weeks pass, it will be too late to sue. The moment that limitation period expires, they will stop taking your calls. You'll get a final email saying sorry, you're out of time, and that will be that. Don't leave this till the last minute. Let me sue right now, and you'll have the money in no time."" Frank was like sure, fine, whatever, don't bother me I got this blah blah blah, and he got off the phone as soon as he could. I sent him the usual email with clear warnings and recommendations, which he ignored. I sent the email again, and then again as the limitation period approached, and again a couple of days before the deadline. ""I'm going to be at trial, and you won't be able to reach me,"" my final email said, ""but you have to sue. You have other firms on your list, so pick one and sue."" He didn't bother to reply, and I went off to do my trial.

The trial lasted a couple of weeks, and no email from Frank. Then a month passed, and another month, still no email. I figured he must have sorted things out. ""Maybe Frank was right after all,"" I said to myself, and then my phone rang. It was Frank.

""Remember that fire insurance thing we spoke about?"" We'd only spoken about it like a dozen times. I figured he was calling up to gloat, so I cut to the chase. ""So they paid out. That's great, Frank. You were right.""

He asked me what I was talking about, and could he see a copy of the claim?

""What claim?"" I said.

""The claim against the insurer. You know, that claim.""

""Does that mean the insurer didn't pay?"" I said. He hung up on me, and then a few minutes later, my computer dinged, and there was Frank's email, talking about how we spoke, and he told me to sue, and he was worried when I hadn't sent him a copy of the claim, so he was following up to get a copy of the claim. I emailed him back. ""I take it that the insurer didn't pay you, just like I told you they wouldn't, and now that the limitation period is expired, they told you to jump in the lake, leaving you with a loss in the millions. Is that it?"" I'd made a mistake by not going over Frank's head when he wouldn't listen to me, but if I'd gone over Frank's head, I never would have received another file from him, so I didn't. But that was then, and this was now, so I CC'd Frank's boss and his boss's boss, plus I CC'd Bill, the client's in-house counsel. Bill acknowledged my email right away and called me later that day.

""Frank messed up,"" he said, ""we know that. He's an idiot. So what do we do?""

""So his excuses didn't work?""

""Nope."" Bill explained that they'd summoned Frank to a boardroom, but his story didn't add up, given all the warnings I'd sent him. Besides, there would have been no reason for him to keep emailing the insurer if he'd told me to sue; once the file goes to legal counsel, Frank's role was over. The company knew Frank was bullshitting them. ""So that's it, then?"" Bill said, ""we just lost a couple of million bucks?""

""It's okay,"" I said, explaining that when I realized that Frank was going to fuck up, I issued a claim against the insurer. Because I'd made Frank send me the proof of loss a while earlier, I had enough information that I could sue to preserve the cause of action. Not a great claim and short on details, but good enough.

""You *sued* without instructions?"" Bill said. Lawyers aren't supposed to sue without instructions because if you do that, you're personally liable for whatever costs the other side incurs. It's a big deal to sue without instructions.

""Yup,"" I said, ""I sued without instructions."" I pulled up a copy of the claim and emailed it to him as we spoke. ""It's a little rough,"" I said, ""but we can always amend.""

""Thank God!"" Bill said, ""can I leave it with you?"" Of course he could. The insurer was a sitting duck, and I knew I'd collect from them, no problem. A few days later, I got a call from another guy who worked for the client, a guy I didn't normally deal with. They had a situation and needed my help.

""I usually deal with Frank,"" I said, ""what's up?""

What was up was that Frank got called into another meeting, and they handed him a one-page letter, and then he put his little office things in a box, and security walked him past his co-workers to the elevator and escorted him downstairs to the parking lot. Bye-bye, Frank. He was too old to get another job, or at least, not a decent one. It was a life-changing event for Frank, but for me, he was just an anecdote, a cautionary tale that I tell young lawyers sometimes over beers, maybe too often, because I'm getting on in years and I have my favorite stories.

I wasn't trying to get revenge on Frank, not at all, and I would have felt a bit sorry for him if he hadn't been trying to throw me under the bus. But the guy who replaced him was great and never nickel and dimed me, so it was all good.",6816,0.97,296,Calledinthe90s,2023-09-29 11:47:32,16vgq6o,7112,High
ProRevenge,Some like it hot 🌶️,"Reading a recent stolen food PR reminded me, I too, have a similar life experience to share. True story. 

I had taken a R&D internship for a food company over the summer in Keokuk (the armpit of Iowa for those unfamiliar). For housing accommodations the company had set me up in the local college dorm that was previously a retirement home so it basically had individual rooms and bathrooms, but one large commercial kitchen. It was summer and the school didn't have a summer program, but allowed 2 fall students to move in at the beginning of the summer. One was rarely there, but the other was constantly in the building and often times had multiple friends over.

Given the kitchen set up, we all stored our food there and it's a pretty no brainier you shouldn't take from others, but immediately I had various food items going missing or being consumed regularly (sodas, empty boxes of cereal put back on the shelf, etc.). I initially posted a sign on the fridge to not eat others food and also confronted both about having food go missing after the sign was up, but it didn't stop whomever from stealing my food (particularly when I'd head out of town for weekends). After complaining about the situation to my manager during my job they helped formulate the perfect ProRevenge.

Given I was doing R&D work on food products, I was responsible for getting various ingredient samples to use for new recipes. My manager suggested I get some capsaicin extracts for my ""research"" even though we weren't doing anything in that realm for flavor profiles. Well I found a company that had various scoville unit extracts and I asked for a variety to see what worked best for our applications. Well did they deliver with some small 2 ounce bottles of 50K, 100K, and 250K scoville extracts! 

I ended up putting the 250K in a travel sized spray bottle (mixed with some water to help as a carrier) and wearing gloves and a mask (borrowed from work) doctored the common food items being stolen with a liberal spraying of my mixture (mainly cereal, chips, crackers, jug of milk and the lip/top of a few soda cans). For the snacks I actually put some into a separate bag and left them open to dry before mixing back into the original packaging. I did this in a different dorm room in my wing as I know well enough how potent this can be in enclosed spaces. 

I did this right before another trip out of town and when I returned I found some of the chips and cereal and milk was missing plus 2 of the 3 cans of soda I had doctored. I never got to see the result and no one ever said anything, but none of my food went missing for the remaining month of my stay. 

I hope the experience was enlightening for them and they still remember the time they played with 🌶️ 🔥.",3405,0.98,135,NebraskaStig,2023-09-21 15:07:36,16opvok,3540,High
ProRevenge,Lunch thief's just desert,"Years ago i had a lunch thief.

 About the 12th time complaining to HR about people stealing my lunch (mandatory reporting every 3rd or 4th instance) i was seathing not a dam thing was being done and i still had to go buy something to eat. 

I was bitching to my doctor at the yearly check up and he got a smile saying ""your constipated then?"" I was dumb and said ""no why"" he wrote me a prescription for some holy fuck laxitive with instructions to ""mix it in with your meal for maximum affect"" at witch point i knew the plan.

I wish i could say they shat their pants but no they ate my sandwich with special avacado sauce. About an hour after lunch i went to HR and reported 2 things 1 my lunch was stolen again and 2 my medication was stolen. HR ""so you got hit by the lunch thief again and your medicine was in the bag?"" Me ""Yes i have had some digestive problems and my doctor prescribed a powerful laxative and advised me to mix it in with my mid day meal."" HR going white ""You what?"" Me smiling ""I mixed in a prescription grade laxative with my food per doctor's orders."" 

Well being that stealing prescribed medication is a criminal offense the police were called and found the lead man from a department over absolutely shitting his brains out. He was furious and accused me of poisoning his food. I asked ""At witch point did you get the idea that food was for you?"" Continued ""furthermore now i no longer have my medication i was prescribed for my condition.""

It was about this time he knew he fucked up and shut his mouth until he got a lawyer or so im told (small town) one of my buddies from high school took his position i can make and eat my hoagies and i have no clue where lunch thief went after his fines and community service.",8548,0.93,607,WildBillyredneck,2023-09-21 09:26:23,16ohb6y,9155,High
ProRevenge,A lawyer's pro revenge on his boss,"“This opinion is shit,” my boss told me. He’d been a lawyer for three years, and the firm assigned me to him for training, to show me, junior counsel, how to be a litigator.

I disliked my boss for a number of reasons. He knew no law, and he expressed himself badly in writing. For a litigator, that’s like strike one and two right there, and strike three was this: he had no balls. He was actually scared of going to court. I noticed this when he took me to assignment court one day, and when it was his turn to speak his hands were shaking. He was scared, in fucking assignment court, where all you do is set a trial date.

“What’s wrong with what I wrote?” I said.

“Not what I asked for,” he said, turning away. But when I checked the memo he’d emailed me two weeks earlier, I saw that the opinion I wrote was exactly what he asked for.

I knew what was up. He was going to delete my dockets for writing the memo and then claim he did it himself, thus leaving quite a bit short of my docketing quota for the month. I knew that he would do this to me, because he’d done this before. I knew that my memo would wind up on a partner’s desk without my name on it. I knew that for a fact, because the firm I worked at was one of the first in the city to have a really good internal network. We were using email for internal communications before the internet became a thing. So the firm was way ahead in terms of technology, but not in terms of security, and not long after I joined the firm I learned how to surf away on the firm’s harddrive and find interesting things, like evidence that my boss was plagiarizing my work.

My boss was the very model of the young downtown lawyer. His perfect shoes always gleamed. He wore bespoke suits because he came from money. Everyone just took it for granted that he was on the partner track. I, on the other hand, was well on my way to  no where special, so maybe he thought it was ok to fuck with me. If so, that was a big mistake on his part.

I didn’t like having my billable hours fucked with. I seriously resented it, because I was already being targeted as one of the juniors who doesn’t docket as much as he should and I was getting pushback from the partner who headed our team. I told the partner what was going on, but he didn't care. It was like being back in middle school and showing up in the office with bruises on my face and the principal saying ‘boys will be boys’ and sending me on my way. “You’ll just have to work harder, or smarter,” the partner said when I reported the latest bullshit thing my boss did to me.

I couldn’t work harder (I was doing the usual six days a week lawyers downtown are forced to do) but I could work smarter, and that night I thought up a plan. Christmas was coming, and I thought I’d give my boss a little present. It landed on his desk on December 24th, in the form of a memo purporting to be from the partner that my boss reported to. The partner was an old guy, and not really on board with emails and computers, so he did everything old school, on paper. So when my boss came in on December 24th and saw a memo on his desk from the partner with a legal research assignment, that wasn’t unusual. The memo was drafted in the usual form that the partner used, because of course I had taken great pains to make sure that it looked authentic. My boss walked over to the little cubicles where the juniors worked, and gave me the same memo. Except his secretary had re-typed it, so now the assignment was from him to me, instead of from the partner to my boss. The assignment was difficult, requiring me to do a deep dive into admiralty law, its relationship to the common law, combined with a constitutional division of powers question.

“But this is a huge assignment,” I whined, “and I’m going to be away. Can’t you get someone else to do it? Is it really urgent?” The memo I’d forged to my boss stressed how totally urgent the situation was, but there was no way my boss could double check with the partner, because the partner left the day before on vacation. That’s why I’d waited until December 24th. “No can do,” my boss said, “this is a big deal. Just let HR know. Maybe they’ll give you time and half or something.” He turned his back and walked away, thinking he had ruined my holidays.

But he was mistaken. You see, I’d written a paper for a third year course that was basically the same thing as the research assignment in the memo. So the only ‘work’ I had to do, was to find the old floppy disk with the draft on it, fiddle with it a bit, and voila: a very detailed and very long memo on an obscure point of Admiralty law, with references starting back to Lord Coke’s day. So I put the memo together, and took my holidays as planned. I wasn’t traveling anywhere (because I had no money) but I saw my family and stayed in town and I made a point of dropping by the office during the holidays, sending an email or two, establishing that I was around, and docketing all my time for the huge amount of research I was allegedly doing.

So the holidays end, and I’m sitting in my shitty little cubicle with a huge stack of work to do and my boss comes up to me, in one of his bespoke suits with a gold tie pin and cufflinks to match. He was wearing a gold watch, too. He was dressed up, even for him, trying to make an impression of some kind.

“Where’s that memo? You were supposed to have it on my desk when I got back. I’m going into a meeting at noon.”

“Just finished it this morning,” I said, handing him the lengthy memo that was still warm from the printer. My boss took the memo in his hands and felt its heft and he smiled. Then he turned and walked away without a word.

Just before lunch I heard a commotion down the hall. It was a pretty loud commotion, as such things go, a loud “fuck!”, and then a door was flung open. It was the partner, and he was screaming for my boss to get his ass into his office, now, right now, as in immediately. I had the pleasure of watching my boss scramble down the hall. “Just what the fucking fuck is this?” the partner said, standing in the doorway to his office, and holding my handiwork at arm's length with his thumb and index finger, as if he were afraid that handling it would soil him. My boss mumbled something, and then the partner ushered him inside. I heard more shouting, then the sound of muffled excuses, and then more shouting from the partner. Then the door flung open again.

“Calledinthe90s. Get your ass in here, too,” the partner said, and I got my ass in their pronto.

“Did you write this fucking memo?” the partner said. I took it from him and looked it over.

“I wrote it. The cover page has been changed to remove my name, but other than that, it’s mine. I spent all Christmas on it. Is there something wrong with it?” The partner exploded.

“Is there something wrong with it? Something wrong? I’ll tell you what’s wrong with it. It’s fucking useless! Totally useless!” I explained that I’d followed my boss’s instructions to the letter, and that I’d docketed more than a hundred hours on it. At this the partner really went nuts, and told me to go back to my desk and fetch him the memo from my boss. I brought it to him, and when he read it, his face went red. He told me I could leave and I hauled ass out of there. From my little cubicle I wasn’t close enough to hear the full chewing out my boss got, but I heard the details through the grapevine over the next few days, about how the partners were seriously pissed that my boss had wasted over a hundred hours of a junior’s time on a useless task that was obviously a prank, and how had my boss not realized that he was being pranked, was he an idiot? I wasn’t blamed at all, of course; I had been working under my boss’s close supervision.

My boss didn’t get fired, but there were some good outcomes for me. For one thing, the partner told me to send him a copy of any memos I wrote for my boss, and that ended him taking credit for my work. My boss also stopped deleting my dockets for my research. Plus I got a belated Christmas bonus for having to give up on my alleged vacation to write the stupid memo.

I really hated working in that place, but whenever times were tough, I’d think back to the Case of the Forged Memo, and that always brought a smile to my face.",8482,0.98,190,Calledinthe90s,2023-09-17 08:45:33,16l12v5,8672,High
ProRevenge,When I wrote my dad’s obituary I didn’t mention my mom and exposed her years of abuse and neglect.,"I originally posted this in PettyRevenge but it was removed so I’m guessing it’s more appropriate for here 🤷🏼‍♀️


My dad died December 1, 2022. He briefly lived with me before his passing after a long stint of being chronically ill for the past 15+ years. 

As his health declined he relied more on my mom for things. Prior to this she was never a great person and fully took advantage of his disability and mobility issues as he declined. For years she claimed be separated and divorced, talking to other men on the internet. She made claims many times she was going to move away and marry someone else. In addition she took advantage of him financially. We tried every legal avenue we could find to have her kicked out, arrested, or force her out but those attempts were met with responses that it was a civil matter and there was nothing that could be done. He made me durable POA and added me to all his accounts. This is a small portion of her abuse but I promise her actions were no less than neglectful and exploitive. I’d tried for years to get my dad to move in with me but he wasn’t leaving the house he worked so hard to pay for. 

I brought him home on hospice the day after thanksgiving and made sure his final days were the best they could be. After meeting with the funeral home to carry out his final wishes I was told they required consent from my mother to allow me to cremate him. It was no surprise she initially told me no and only agreed after I “allowed” her to keep the social security survivor benefits, which would have been hers anyway 🙄

I wrote his obituary and left her out of it. There was not a single word or mention he’d ever been married or had a spouse. I didn’t feel she deserved to be recognized or viewed as a grieving widow when she spent their marriage as a shitty spouse and person. She lost her mind and there were many questions from friends and family alike. 

I’ve spent years in therapy working through maternal narcissistic abuse and believe if she didn’t want me to talk about it she shouldn’t have done it. When people asked about it I was honest about the years of abuse my father and I endured from her. I’ve completely ruined the public image and victim complex she spent years creating. I might be the villain and AH in this scenario but I’d do it again in a heartbeat.",12097,0.98,333,strugglebus_RN,2023-09-10 02:03:41,16ethc6,12430,High
ProRevenge,An Attorney’s Dream Case: My Parents vs the Bank,"  
In 1973, my parents had enough money to build a little ranch house in the country. The small bank in town approved the mortgage & the bank signed a contract to give “Bob” the money to build the house.

Bob, as it turns out, was overbooking himself all over town, leaving his clueless minions to do the actual work. The build took longer and longer, with more and more work having to be ripped out and redone.

We’re not talking about using the wrong color paint or nailing up some wonky trim, here. The architect forgot to fully erase a line on the blueprints & the framers built a wall through the bathtub. My mother was told “Don’t put anything heavy in the kitchen cabinets” bc they were attached to the drywall – not the studs - using a few roofing nails through the back of each cabinet. The garage door opening was framed into the living room instead of towards the driveway. And so on.

When the bank’s representative showed up for the final inspection, my parents met him in the front yard & refused to sign off on Bob’s work. Then representative became angry, as the bank had paid Bob a lot of money. He strode to the front door & pulled on the doorknob, whereupon the entire door – casing included – fell on him. It had simply been wedged (not nailed) into place.

The bank called Bob, who finally showed up to supervise the work himself. The only problem was that Bob wasn’t any better at building a house than his minions were. My parents still refused to sign off on the house.

My mother was a SAHM in a nasty rental with two tiny children while my dad was working two jobs while this was going on. Throughout the entire process, the bank & Bob treated them very poorly, bullying my mom & lying to my dad. What should have been an exciting time for my parents was ruined. My mom cried a lot. My dad got depressed.

Finally, the bank threatened my parents with foreclosure & Bob threatened to sue my parents for breach of contract bc the bank refused to pay him any more money.

So my exhausted parents went to an attorney & gave him the rundown. Plumbing, electrical, tiling issues – the whole sorry mess. My parents were scared. All they had was their small downpayment savings, so if this became a lengthy court battle the bank & Bob would win.

The attorney, “Tom”, was kind, but my dad said he could tell that he and Mom were doomed from Tom’s facial expressions as he sorted through the paperwork. Then, abruptly, Tom smiled. “Let’s get everyone together for a meeting,” he told my parents. “Tomorrow.”

So my parents, Tom, the bank’s representative, the bank’s attorney, Bob, & Bob’s attorney met at the bank.

Tom didn’t give anyone else time to begin. He said, “Well, my clients have decided that they no longer want this house. Please remove it.”

Everyone else start to laugh. “Remove it? Have you lost your mind?”

Tom, in a sweeping, theatrical gesture, placed a deed on the table.

“My clients own the land the house is sitting on outright. They no longer want the house. Get the house off my clients’ land.”

Bob’s attorney stared at the deed, & then turned & stared at Bob. “You built a house on land YOU DON’T OWN?” Bob nodded.

The bank’s attorney started yelling at the bank’s representative. “YOU DIDN’T FINANCE THE LAND THE HOUSE IS ON?” The representative stammered, “Uh…no…?”

Tom said firmly, “As I said, gentlemen, you’re trespassing on my clients’ land. I expect the house to be removed & the land returned to its original state, AT ONCE.”

My Dad said he’ll remember the blank looks everyone on the other side of the table passed to one another for his whole life. Sure, the bank could foreclose…on a house that wouldn’t exist by the end of the week, with no way to recoup the money. They didn’t even own the land it was on. Bob was out the 50% he’d paid out of pocket, plus he was on the hook for tearing down the house & removing it. On top of that, the bank would undoubtedly want him to repay the initial 50% they’d given him.

Could they have gone after my parents? Sure. A foreclosure would have meant bad credit for my parents moving forward. They might lose their downpayment. But to sign off on the house in its condition at that time would have meant thousands and thousands of dollars in cash to replace/repair everything from the roof to the basement before the house could be safely lived in. The bank knew my parents didn’t have that kind of money; they’re the ones who approved the mortgage!

Suddenly, my parents were good people, it was all SUCH a misunderstanding, & the bank & Bob couldn’t do enough for them! The house was brought in line with the original blueprints & specifications immediately, at no extra cost to my parents (but at considerable cost to Bob). My parents signed the mortgage. Bob got the rest of his money (& just about broke even on the build). The bank’s representative was fired.

And Tom, attorney extraordinaire, got a stinging tale of triumph to recall to fellow attorneys for the rest of his life!  
  
  
\* Before you question this tale, please remember that 1973 was 50 years ago. Banks did things differently back then. Smaller rural banks, in particular, were not run the same way the bigger, city banks were. There were far fewer Federal regulations, & in a smaller community people didn’t always follow them, anyway. (I’m pretty sure they don’t always follow them now.)

\* Yes, they built a wall through the bathtub. No, I’m not making that up. I even left out how a plumber left his lunch bag on a partially built kitchen cabinet, but the cabinetmaker didn’t feel it was his job to move the bag so he left it there & built the rest of the cabinet around it. I don’t know where Bob found these people, but they were gems, every one of them! /s  


EDIT:

I must admit that I'm immensely surprised at the traction this story has gotten. 😳

The bank & Bob put together very poorly written & pretty much unenforceable contracts. My parents' attorney figured this out & the bank & Bob had to back off.

I thought this was interesting, but surely not the one & only time this happened. Aren't contracts being written all the time by clueless people? Is this really that unique? I guess we should be glad it is! 😂 Thanks for reading! ❤️",10918,0.98,342,CampfiresInConifers,2023-08-30 15:19:00,165phqm,11260,High
ProRevenge,A lawyer's pro revenge on a wife beater,"Let’s call him Joe.  I have to call him something, the man I ruined, but I can’t call him by his real name, so let’s call him Joe.  Joe was a wife beater. 
  

  
I was hired by Joe’s brother-in-law, the brother of the wife that Joe beat.  My client was also Joe’s ex-business partner.  Aside from the whole ‘you beat up my sister thing,’ my client had another beef with Joe, a serious business beef.   My client took it to court, and gave me the case to handle. 
  

  
Joe was confident that his bullshit and outright perjury would carry the day.  It had always worked before.  His bullshit, and his fists, had won him a good settlement with his ex-wife, free of child support, so maybe he thought that threats and lies would carry the day once more, but he was wrong, and after the trial I had a judgment against him, a big judgment, far bigger than he could pay.  
  

  
Joe twisted and he turned and he shimmied and shaked, but after a while I’d located and taken all his assets.  It was easy, really; Joe had no thought of  consequences, and so he didn’t lawyer up until it was too late.  If one of my clients ever sues you, you’re in trouble, because my clients lawyer up before they even know your name.  But Joe didn’t lawyer up until the process server threw the papers at his feet, and by then, it was far too late.
  

  
I went through Joe’s assets like a meat grinder, and after a while Joe had but one property left, a house, and he clung to that house, for it was rented out, and his sole source of income.  Joe lived in the unfinished basement, and he survived on what the upstairs tenants paid him. He cashed their rent cheques at payday loan places, paying hefty fees, but it was worth it, because he knew that I’d garnish any bank account that he opened.
  

  
Joe managed to hide his rental place from me for a while because he owned it through a numbered company, but my investigator found him one day, and followed him home.   
  

  
Joe self-repped his way through the next stage, which took a couple of years, while I punctured his corporate veils and his sad efforts at a fraudulent conveyance, but in the end, I had his last house, the house where he lived in the unfinished basement.  Joe stepped out one day to get a pack of cigarettes, and when he came back the sheriff had changed the locks.
  
  
  
“Can my client at least live in the basement?” Joe’s lawyer said to me, pro bono, because by this point Joe had nothing to pay lawyers.  I knew the pro bono guy; he practiced law nearby.   As I was talking to him, I could see Pro Bono guy’s office window across the parking lot from my office tower window.
  

  
“Ask the purchaser,” I said, “it’s out of my hands,” and it was.   I told Joe’s lawyer that the new owner (a nominee, one of my client’s employees)  wouldn’t let him back into his shitty basement apartment.  Joe,  a man who had owned this and that here and there and all over town had just lost the last thing he owned on earth.  Except for his truck.  He still had his truck left.  
  

  
Joes’ truck was this big ass gas guzzling beast that he drove around in.  It was too old and too frail to be worth seizing, so I let Joe keep it, and I was glad I did that, because now the truck was where Joe slept.  Until he made a mistake, and lost his truck, too.   He lost his truck the day I got a phone call from the tenants at the house that Joe used to own.
  

  
“He came back, and parked his truck across the driveway, "" the tenant said, adding that  Joe had gone nuts.  He’d parked his truck there in a rage, out of spite,  and then walked into town, saying he’d be back later that day to sleep in his truck.
  
  
  
“Can you get around the truck?”  I asked. The tenant could not.  The driveway was blocked.  I called one of the tow truck guys that I used to defend back in my criminal lawyer days, and in a couple of hours that truck was gone, and parked somewhere else, somewhere special, in accordance with my specific instructions.
  

  
“My guy wants his truck back,” the pro bono lawyer said the next day when he called me.
  

  
“Not happening,” I said.  I stood in my office fifteen floors above the parking lot, and looked down where I imagined my pro bono counterpart was standing in his office, facing the same lot.
  

  
“But you have no right to the truck,” he said.
  

  
“He has no right to block a man’s driveway,” I replied.  It was terrible, really, standing up high, pronouncing words that took away a man’s final asset, the last thing he owned on earth.  I imagined that this must be what God feels like, before he strips a man of everything and sends him to hell. 
  

  
“Are you really gonna make me go to court over this?” said Pro Bono guy.
  

  
“Do what you gotta do,” I said, and Pro Bono guy said his client was coming in the next day to sign an affidavit, and then they were going to court to get the truck back.  But I was unconcerned.
  

  
The next day was bright and the sun was shining  and it was nine a.m. as I looked out the window, and sipped my coffee.  My phone rang.  I picked up.    It was Pro Bono man.
  

  
“Why didn’t you tell me that Joe’s truck was parked right outside my office?”  His voice was tight, and I could tell that he must have been shaking with anger.
  

  
“Is that so?” I said, staring out at Joe’s truck parked fifteen stories below me.  “How careless of my bailiff to leave the truck where your client could easily take it back.  I really must speak to him.”
  

  
“Very funny.  My client’s going to sue--”
  

  
“No he isn’t.  He’s going to get in that truck and drive away, right now.  I told my tow guy to fill up the tank, and he gave it an oil change too, gratis.  Tell your client to get in his truck and drive off, and that if I ever see that truck again, I’ll seize it, to satisfy the rest of my client’s judgment.”  Pro Bono guy tried to argue, but I was firm.  Then I put the phone down, and picked up my coffee.
  

  
A few minutes later Joe walked out of his lawyer’s  office and over to his truck.  As he walked I saw that there was no longer a bounce to his step. The joy had gone out of him.  Joe wasn’t the first guy I ruined and he won’t be the last, but he is the only one whose final ruin I witnessed from on high, from my office, and it was one of the most powerful experiences of my life, watching a man walk to his truck, knowing that I had stripped him of everything else he had,  and that he owed his possession of his last asset, his truck, to my mercy.  
  

  
Joe drove away, his big ass ancient truck spilling clouds of smoke from the exhaust.  I was pretty sure I’d never hear from him again, and I never did.",6857,0.93,572,Calledinthe90s,2023-08-24 20:14:44,160kn0r,7429,High
ProRevenge,I blew up a romance scammers life,"I blew up a romance scammer’s life


This one is fresh and still unfolding but it’s already hit an explosive level. Some details intentionally vague.

Context: I’m a woman in my 30s with a reasonably good corporate type job in a field with lots of room for growth and am recently back into the dating scene after a decade. I’m kind of a “would be a 10 if she lost 30 lbs” looking girl, beautiful face if a bit chubby, but I never have issues getting a date. I’m not well off but I’m stable and have a bit of spending money. I live in a large multicultural city and my ex was an immigrant so I’m open to dating people of any origin. 

What happened: 
A few weeks ago I met a very charming man from a Latin American country only a couple years younger than me. Seemed very sweet, cuddly, intelligent, family oriented, emotionally available, educated and in a good profession back home in his country and had a lot in common with me. Chemistry seemed amazing inside and outside the bedroom. 
He was honest that he was in my country on a tourist visa but hoping to stay. I made it clear I wouldn’t be able to help him with that but we’d have a fun summer fling while he was here. If he managed to stay or come back, only then would we consider a real relationship. 

Then the other shoe dropped. A couple weeks and 4 dates in, During a text conversation about my work, he asked me to be his sugar mommy. I initially laughed and assumed it was a joke. He kept pushing and clearly said it wasn’t. Of course, feeling insulted by this, I went off on him. He maintained it as a serious ask until I hit a nerve with my complaints about how embarrassed he should be to ask me that. Then he got angry and insulted me for thinking he was serious about it. No apology for being hurtful to me.

Obviously what I did next was take screenshots and cry about it to my closest friends.  I was hurt that I was fooled into thinking he liked me and that he thought I needed to pay for a man. My friends started the fuse on what happened next. 

One of my friends started snooping more on his online presence, together we found about 6 different Instagram accounts that were him using different variations of his name and different photos of himself all uploaded in batches. On Facebook, a similar pattern. All very scammy and suspicious looking. He’d been foolish enough on one of his profiles though to follow and tag the employer that he was working for illegally on his tourist visa in my country. 
So I contacted another close friend in a local law enforcement agency that works with immigration. She looked up his file, he had a wife and daughter at home! 

I released the hounds after that. The friend who helped me investigate online made several group chats on multiple platforms with all of his family (immediate and extended) and friends. She released all the screenshots as well as a rant about how shameful it was. As they started blocking her, she added more people. I found his sisters phone number, she sent her messages on there too. Everyone he knows including his wife know he’s unfaithful and trying to take advantage of women. 

30 mins after the online bombardment started I got a rude message from him about how I should be smart enough to know he was joking and he doesn’t need to sell himself. I didn’t reply. 

Next step? Online immigration reporting form with all the info we found; work info, employer name and address, his home address, full name, dob, photos, screenshots admitting to working. 
Usually these reports take months to be reviewed if at all but I gave the file number to my law enforcement friend.
Two days later, law enforcement officers visited him at home. They found him with a phone number that was issued to a local resident. All his roommates also had numbers issued to the same person, a direct link to the employer. 
He received a caution for trying to scam me,  a no contact order and a flag on his immigration file that based on his country of origin will likely mean he can never return as well as a strict warning to not work without authorisation. His roommates also received warnings. 
His employer received a visit next.  They found significant proof that they’d been employing him illegally as well as multiple other people. Their investigation is still ongoing but so far they are likely to receive tens of thousands in fines or possible jail time. The guy isn’t getting deported because the government would have to pay for it and proceedings take longer than his remaining visa time but he’s now upgraded from a flagged file to a multi year ban on reentry to my country. If he bothers me again though he will be deported as well. 

Hope he enjoys going back to his angry wife and the ridicule from everyone he knows. See ya again never!

EDIT:
The comments on my appearance are a tongue in cheek way of describing how he may have viewed me and speak more to his failure to select the correct victim profile. It’s not that deep and I don’t really care about my appearance very much. Relax a bit peeps.

ProRevenge,Boss tried to sleep with my fiancée,"This was several years ago. So my boss, an extreme type “A” personality, found out I was seeing a young lady at another one of our offices, it was a long distance relationship. He was the type he liked to control everything and mess with people for fun. He was also married to another employee, but he was very unfaithful. And he had a hobby, photography, he liked to take pics of himself and his conquest, in the act! Then he would show the pics around the production floor and brag about it.
 Well, on his next trip to this other office he tried to get my girlfriend to sleep with him, but she spurned him. He made up some lies and got her fired.  


It took a long time but I was patient, I knew he kept the photos in his office, he could not risk keeping them at home where his wife might stumble upon them. One Saturday I was working OT and the cleaning lady came thru, they unlocked his office. I came in acting like I was taking dimensions on some drawings. The lady just ask me to close the door when I was finished. She left and went down toward accounting, that’s when I went thru his desk. Sure enough in the back of one drawer I found a stack of photos 4” tall. I took them all!  


Then I waited until he went on another trip. When he did, I went out for lunch, I had a dozen pics of him, in the act with 4 different women, all showing his face, the women all had dark or red hair, his wife is a blonde! I drove to the town he lived in, to the closest post office to his house, and mailed the pics to his wife with no return address.  


She divorced him, and her lawyer took him to the cleaners! My girlfriend is now my wife, and we aren’t mad anymore.",14280,0.96,391,No-Cat-2980,2023-08-18 17:56:55,15uz58u,14671,High
ProRevenge,IT pro revenge on cheating wife,"T.L.D.R. below 

Someone posted a story earlier that was a bit too close to a true story that I was involved in. I previously shared it as a comment in another sub and thought I'd share the real story.

This takes place before smartphones were omnipresent.

I had a friend (we'll call him Bob) that was suspicious of his wife's social circle. One of her closest friends had been caught cheating and tried to throw her under the bus as well. Bob had no proof and things settled down for a while. 

Bob was an IT professional and very VERY good with PCs and networks. 

Nearly a year later Bob's wife is acting shady again after her high school reunion. He confides in me and we talked through some scenarios, he jokingly mentioned a keylogger. He finally asked me to just drop it and most of all  ""don't tell anyone, not even your wife"".

A couple months pass and I'm up early, 5:30-6, getting ready for work. I get a Facebook messenger notification and see that I've been sent a link from Bob, but it's a group chat. It's literally everyone we know, her family, his family our friends, strangers... everyone. I didn't open it, it looked like a phishing link even though it came from him who's extremely cautious.

A short while later I get an email from Bob with some ominous/unsavory comments and the same link. It's a group email with the recipients open copied, his wife's work, her family, her friends, his family other people I didn't know. 

I knew it was legitimate now, so I opened it. The link was to a hastily made website containing pictures and videos of his wife and another man. This wasn't hidden camera footage, it was screenshots including video screen captures. Weeks worth of screenshots. He had captioned each item with snarky comments and colorful names for his wife and her lover.

It was an embarrassing amount of evidence. Videos of her masturbating with her lover. Chat logs about how they can't wait to fuck again. Solo masturbation videos of her and him. Tons of pictures. And the straw that broke the camel's back... Trash talking her husband to her lover. Comments about how much bigger and better he was. Her efforts to stroke her lover's ego were especially hurtful.

I dropped what I was doing and called him. He was drunk and combative, he had been up all night making the website and drowning in liquor. Not one good word to say about women in general. He was extremely emotional but after some work I had convinced him to take the website down before it does irreparable damage to his marriage, their careers and his children.

As he's sobbing and logging in to remove the website I hear loud yelling as she bursts into the room. A screaming match ensues and there's nothing I can do to pull him back. Apparently her mother or sister saw the page, blew up her phone until she woke up and answered. She saw the website and went on the offensive. The phone call drops after 30 seconds of her screaming while Bob is calling her a whore and I can't contact him again. The website was still up for the rest of the day and he was kind enough to put a view counter on it. HUNDREDS of people watched her masturbating with a married former classmate.

Bob had done his homework. He installed a keylogger that records the whole screen. When he was out she would log into the PC and/or Facebook and play with her boyfriend. Bob had found her lover, his family , his wife, his wife's family, his job, etc etc. All these people were included in the Facebook and email groups.

I do not know what became of her lover and his marriage, but I do know what happened to Bob's life. His wife was desperate to make amends, she tried and offered everything. In the end it was her comments about her lover and his prowess that were her undoing. Bob tried to take her back, even after all his friends and family had seen her naked and cheating. But he couldn't get over the comments about his manhood. Bob eventually left her, gained about 100lbs and then finally moved as far away as possible and became a horrible human being. I have no idea what he's doing now as he went scorched earth with most friendships and his family. She's gross and has a face shaped like a bowling ball now. Line forms at the rear...



T.L.D.R. : former friend sets a trap for his unsuspecting cheating wife. He then shares all the pictures and videos with her friends, family, employer as well as the boyfriend's wife, family and employer. Many lives ruined.

ProRevenge,"Ex Cheat on me with her cousin and expected to save face, I think not.","For context, it was her cousin-in-law.

Let's start this story by saying this happened 12 years ago. I'm now happily married with three children and regret absolutely nothing.

I was with my new ex for 3 years. I had noticed that she was being extremely controlling. I was expected to give every little detail of my day and tell her my schedule in advance, and if I deviated from that, she would be very upset. She chalked it up to just bad feelings she was having and shrugged it off as her paranoia for past relationships of infidelity. I had never once cheated or strayed, and I never gave her a reason to act like this. It felt unbecoming of my fiance to act in such a way.

Now this is where it gets juicy. After she had asked for my schedule to make plans, as mine tends to be more hectic than hers, I noticed she was texting someone. In my line of work, if I put in more than 40 hours, I have the ability to take time off at will as long as the work is completed at a later date. I was very good friends with a brother and still am. We laugh about this to this day, and he actively reminds her of it. I messaged him stating I wanted to do something special for her a little bit earlier than our anniversary to make sure it was a special surprise. They both worked in the same fabrication facility. He was a fabricator and she a shipping manager. He was kind enough to let me know her schedule. That's where the discrepancy falls into place. Without my knowledge, she was foregoing overtime; she worked 12-hour shifts Monday through Friday, with the exception of Wednesday, when she would only work half a day. She had been taking Wednesdays off right around the time that she started getting extremely controlling. Lucky for me, I had stacked several days of leisure time up, so taking a Wednesday off for me was not an issue. A few days go by, and Wednesday's here. I put on my work gear and ""leave"" for work. I was expecting her to leave as our apartment complex had two exits on the same road I could see directly across from a shopping center, so I parked my car near the back and waited.

After about an hour, I notice a very specific red Mustang with a specific decal on the back window. It was her cousin by marriage. I had also done my due diligence to take an old laptop, which we kept on our desk in an office area with a full view of the living room, bedroom door and bathroom plus the kitchen. I had set it up for remote access and had it alert me when the webcam noticed movement. Giving her the benefit of the doubt, I thought he may be dropping something off or coming over to assist her with something, as her family sometimes does. Sure enough, a message came through so I remote into my laptop. He walks through the door without skipping a beat, she unbuttons his shirt and begins kissing him. I created a URL link for the live stream. And as she was preoccupied, we had a family group text and a friend group text. They were both part of it, but at the current time, they were currently indisposed and didn't look at their phones. They didn't even wait; they could have gone to the bedroom, but no, they decided to get freaky deeky right there on the couch. I sent the link off to the friend group chat and the family group chat. Within minutes, I'm getting calls non-stop from friends and family alike. There was no turning back. She was getting blown up, but she was ignoring her phone. Not until the 4th or 5th call came through did they decide to take a break.

For context, the state I live in allows recording of personal property regardless of occupancy. I was the only one on the lease; she wasn't allowed to be on the lease because of poor credit.

The call she had picked up was from her cousins mother who she was banging. She answers the phone on speaker, and I kid you not, the first words out of his mother's mouth were stop fucking my son. They both became rigid, and she began to stutter over her words, saying, What are you talking about? etc. The mother then divulged that there was a live feed of them sent out by me to her family. She grabbed every pillow off the couch and covered herself up. The cousin staggered off, trying to put on his pants and shoes, just to trip himself up and bang his head off of my coffee table. Leaving it with a divot. By this time, I had made my way to the front of the apartment complex. I was there to greet the adulterer as he came out of the front exit. He froze and began to cry, apologizing profusely. I'm not going to lie; what happened afterwards wasn't my best moment, and I nearly got into legal trouble if it weren't for the fact that he was trespassing on private property. Let's just say I had a cast for 6 weeks, and he wasn't in any family photos for months.

I went up to the apartment, where she was now fully clothed and crying inconsolably. I asked her if it was snot or cum on her face. Then I told her not to answer because it didn't matter anyway. I gave her 1 hour to remove all her belongings, as again, everything in the apartment was mine except for clothes, some makeup, and a few kitchen utensils.

Her mother would not let her move in, as she was just filled with embarrassment. Same for her brothers, and the cousin's mother kicked her son out. Rumor spread around our town very quickly, and for a lack of better words, she was untouchable.

Edited for bad grammar juju.
Edited for UPDATE of proof
No police report for theft of property I apologize y'all.

ProRevenge,I broke up with my boyfriend on his birthday for horrible actions he did when he was a teenager,"I don't know whether this count as a ""pro"" revenge but here is my story, which happened some years ago: 

&#x200B;

I (26F at the time) had just started dating Thomas (28M) and things seemed promising: very sweet man, educated and quite smart, good looks. After 7 weeks of dating, he invited me and 2 of his childhood friends (let's call them Alex and Bart) for a long 29th birthday celebration weekend  at his fathers' country house in a small French town. His father was going to be around as well and I was very excited to meet everyone. 

Day 1 (Friday) is fun. I am happy to get along well with Thomas' father, a smart and caring man. 

Day 2 (Saturday) : after a very nice day, we enjoy a party in the garden with the neighbors (including some friends of Thomas). After a few hours and lots of drinks, a group of people gather around a small campfire and start sharing childhood memories. This is where things go wrong. 

At first of course, innocent and dumb stories as you would expect ; but then, Thomas and his friends started sharing REALLY sick stuff. 

In particular, they told a story about how, when they were 14 or 15 years old, they found very amusing to bully for almost six months ""Arthur"", a boy of their school who was very isolated and shy. Making jokes, calling names, you name it. As if this was not enough, they created a fake girl profile on msn messenger (a computer platform to exchange live messages that we used in years 2000s) and spent f\*cking months (!) exchanging messages with him under the false girl identity, flirting and developping a false relationship with the poor boy. Some people were in the confidence at school and it became a big and cruel joke behind Arthur's back. They used pictures of Bart's real cousin and the  boy truly thought he had some kind of online girlfriend to whom he even sent confessions and love messages. At some point they got bored and scheduled a false rendez-vous IRL asking the boy to take a bus for 2 or 3 hours, wearing a tshirt Elmer the Elephant (based on a private joke). Obviously there was no one waiting for him and they did not know how long he waited over there, by himself. If Arthurd had not alreay understood what was going on, he found out the next day at school after Thomas and Bart told the story to everyone and even shared the love messages that Arthur had been writing. The poor boy stopped coming to class and apparently changed school and it is easy to imagine that this must have been extremely traumatizing to him. 

Do you think that Thomas, Alex and BArt had any bit of shame about it? NOT A BIT of remorse, in particular on Thomas and BArt side. They kept making jokes about it and even seemed to regret that they were ""not good enough at being evil"" to convince the boy to send nudes or sexy pics. I don't even want to imagine what would have happened if he had done so. 

To say that I felt uncomfortable would be a gross understatement. I was absolutely horrified and started to despise Thomas more than anything. I was not the only one shocked: Thomas' father, who heard the end of the story, had the most disappointed look in the eyes. His stupid son was so drunk that he did not even notice it. I escaped the party immediately after that and got back to the house.

I could not sleep at all this night and I kept thinking about the evening and how Thomas was still finding this funny. I heard him coming to bed around 4am but I pretended I was asleep.

Day 3 (Sunday)  was the actual birthday, and the initial plan was that I would take Thomas on a 1-1 fancy surprise date for lunch nearby and then we would meet the group for a late afternoon party. But instead, I woke up very early on Sunday morning, took all my stuff in silence and went alone to the train station where I took a direct train heading back to Paris.

I decided to send a text to Thomas wishing him happy birthday and telling him to meet me at a certain location 1 hour from the house for a surprise and that I needed to go a little bit in advance to make sure that everything would be perfect. I had picked the location randomly, using google maps, to gain time. 

Thomas read the text around 10am, when he woke up. He responded with excitement that he would follow religiously the instructions. When he arrived there at 12:30, I told him to wait further as there was little delay on something. Then I asked him to meet me at a restaurant which was 30min drive from the initial location. When he arrived at 13:15, I texted him that I was on my way, would arrive in 20min and that he will understand when he sees me why I made him wait ; I also asked him to order some food and the most expensive bottle on the menu. Around 13:30 he started calling me several times and sent a lot of worried texts, and after 45 minutes I responded (in French) ""So, how does it feel to have people play with your feelings?"". Then I stopped responding. I let him call and text the entire afternoon, but never responded. At some point an unknown number called me, it was his friend Alex asking what was going on and that Thomas birthday was completely ruined because of what I did. I just responded : ""this is an extremely small payback for what you did to Arthur. Tell Thomas to stop calling me."" and hung up. I blocked them. 

I still felt bad the entire evening as I had started to grow attached to Thomas back then. The following days, a common friend called me to say that my reaction was completely absurd and unfair, that it was not my role to punish someone for actions they did as a teenager, that they were adult ways of saying things and that I had been completely crazy. Only a few people supported what I did, everyone else seemed to think that I was a bitch. 

Thomas tried to fix things and win me back for a few months afterwards. I never responded to any of his messages. 

I don't regret it. I simply hope that Arthur, who should be 35 or 36 years old now, is well. 

&#x200B;

EDITS:

- I really did not expect so many reactions and comments. As expected, I see that not everyone approves what I did ; but I am surprised to receive so many kind messages . Thank you! 

-  about Thomas’ father : he was actually one of the few people understanding my actions. He called me shortly after the incident to discuss an unrelated topic (I was to give him a list of recommendations about something) and was already aware of everything. He did not bad mouth his son but i could really feel that he was disappointed ; he simply told me that he had not found sleep the night of Saturday to Sunday because of what he had heard during the party. He told me he appreciated meeting me and expressed regret that I was not with his son anymore, but also said that he understood my reasons. He did not try to convince me to get back with Thomas. This man was truly a gentleman. 

- I don’t know what became of Arthur. I don’t even know his last name. I think that even if I had known his name, I would not have reached out to him by fear of making him remember things that he probably wants to forget. I hope he is a confident man (and that he still likes Elmer the Elephant).",7932,0.95,580,CatherineTheTiger,2023-08-13 15:45:16,15q9qbg,8512,High

NuclearRevenge,Reminder: Criteria For User Comments,"Hello! This is a reminder to remain respectful when leaving comments or sending messages to other users or our mod team.

Recently, we had to lock a few posts due to a lot of misbehavior in the comments. Eventually, we decided to unlock them after clearing up the comments. Do not make us regret this decision.

While I’m at it, I might as well provide some criteria for leaving comments in general. 

**So, what kind of comments are allowable?**

• Compliments
• Questions
• Respectful Criticism/Observations (this helps us review posts)

**Now, what kind of comments are not allowable?**

• Insults
• Rude Criticism
• Wasteful/Low Effort Comments (that don’t contribute whatsoever)

**What about miscellaneous comments that are unrelated to the post?**

• We will decide to approve or remove these kind of comments at our own discretion. But most of the time, it should be fine. 

As a side note: In most cases, bad comments are simply removed with no further action. But in some cases, users may also be banned.

NuclearRevenge,Revenge on a hacker,"One day I get an email from a hosting provider telling me that attacks are being launched from our server and I need to look into it.

I find that there is indeed a hacker in our server. He was using an app to anonymously control his bot network, among other things.

I looked at the app he was using, and discovered that it was an opensource project. I then downloaded the code for this backdoor, modified it to log everything to a file, and replaced his app with my honeypot version.

Over the next six months I collected every scrap of information I could on this guy. I then used that information to take over many of his online accounts, including his main email account. That was the account where he had registered all of his services to, so I was able to issue password reset requests for everything he owned. I gained control of six other email accounts, two dozen IRC accounts, his facebook page, his dating profile, numerous websites, and the backup site he used for his cell phone. I have his phone number, his moms number, and his girlfriends number. I know his address, his birthday, the schools he went to, even his favorite foods and music.

After I took every single online account he had ever had away from him, I sent a nasty email to his ISP in an effort to extort yet more information from them. In that email I said some very unkind things about the monarch of Indonesia and how I might smear the monarch publicly if I didn't get the information.

The hacker dispeared immediatly after that. I have looked for him at times over the last fifteen years since and he has not resurfaced. The Indonesian lèse-majesté laws regarding insults to the monarchy are not to be trifled with. The prison term for such an offense is 15 years.",1910,0.95,94,DavesPlanet,2024-09-30 19:00:05,1ftajvn,2004,High
NuclearRevenge,Revenge on an animal abuser ,"One day I was on my evening walk with my dog and we came across a small dog standing in the middle of the street shaking. It’s hair was matted, had mange, ridden with fleas, one eye swollen and sealed shut with mucus, nails so long it was walking on the back of its paws, malnourished, and quivering. I was shocked. 

I called my wife to bring me a blanket and come pick us up. While I was waiting, the door of the house in front of us opened, and out came a disheveled looking older man. He started calling for the dog to come inside. I absolutely lost it. I screamed at him asking if it was his dog and he replied it was. I asked him why it was in such bad shape and he said “she’s sick and won’t eat”. I yelled at him there was no fucking way in the world I was letting him take her back inside. The shouting match lasted long enough for a few neighbors to come outside. (Who later told me he had another dog in the house). Eventually my wife pulls up and I wrap the doggo in the blanket and go home. 

I looked up the name of our local no kill shelter but they were closed until the following day. My wife and I decided to call her Sally. I gave Sally a bath and went and bought some wet food since she wouldn’t eat dry kibble. She devoured it. I set her up a nice sleeping area in the garage for her to spend the night. 

1st thing in the morning I took Sally to the shelter and called animal control and told them what happened. They went to check her out, took a statement from me, and ended up at his house confiscating his other dog. Unfortunately Sally was put down due to the horrible shape it was in (she was also very old). 

Here’s where the revenge begins. 

This old assholes house was on the route I took to walk my dog twice a day. My dog liked to take a dump about two houses before we reached his. Perfect! Now I didn’t need to carry bags of shit all the way back to my house! I started tossing them on his roof twice a day. At first he would climb a ladder around once a week to get them down, but eventually I broke his will to do that. This went on for about a year before I moved. His roof was covered in shit bags. 

I also printed out flyers with his address and pictures of how I found Sally and put them in all the neighbors mailbox’s. 

I live across town now, but every couple months I ride by and toss a bag of dogshit on his roof to let him know I’m still thinking about Sally. ",1399,0.95,43,BalloonKnotBandit,2024-09-22 18:24:32,1fn6ndp,1442,High
NuclearRevenge,Hell hath no fury like two women scorned; say goodbye to all your stuff,"15 years ago I had a boyfriend that I'd been with for 6 years. He moved to another city for work, while I finished my studies and then I would move there too. He was apartment hunting, subleasing in the meantime.

He came home almost every weekend and during Christmas and New Year's.

He found an apartment in January and invited me up to show it and I prepared to move up; looking for a job, looking for new furniture etc. 

Late February I told him it's time to terminate the lease on the apartment in our home town, when he suddenly broke up with me. I was shocked and very sad. He collected some clothes and his very expensive PC, which he'd built from scratch. It was his baby.

2 weeks later, he updated his profile pic on fb to him and another woman kissing! Obviously, they hadn't been dating 2 weeks. I called him and called him out on it and he admitted to having met her 2 months ago. He was at the airport to travel abroad with his buddy for the weekend, so we didn't talk long.

That same evening I decided to tell the new gf. I managed to find her on fb and wrote her.

She didn't believe me at first, of course. But I sent her texts, pics, I described their apartment in detail (well, *her* apartment, as it turned out). When I sent her a dic pick he'd sent me with their bedroom clearly in the background she said okay, enough, I believe you.

She told me they'd been dating for 8 months, not 2. She'd been in Africa for 2 months, in December and January, which would explain why he was able to be with me for 2 weeks over the holidays and why he could invite me to see the apartment.

We wrote A LOT. He'd sent us the exact same Valentine's Day text. He'd bought us the exact same Christmas present etc, you get the picture. After comparing notes, it was time for revenge.

She cut up all of his clothes and left them in a pile on the floor. I told her about the PC and advised her to tear that fucker to pieces. She hacked it with screwdrivers and hammers and every piece was beyond saving.

When he came home on Sunday, she tossed him out with nowhere to go, but not before showing him all of his possessions obliterated.


EDIT: I need to clarify that legally, it was my PC. I'd won money on one of those scratch lottery tickets, but since we were living together I kind of thought of it as ours. Huge mistake!",2672,0.96,161,OG_SisterMidnight,2024-09-18 14:35:43,1fk1i73,2833,High
NuclearRevenge,My neighbor liked to clean,"First posted in r/pettyrevenge, but I was told it belongs here. I thought I got nuclear but my revenge still was petty, I let you be the judge of that.

2001, I had just moved to a quiet neighborhood where my children (1&3) could play outside safely and grow up with neighborhood children. It was also nice for my cats (3) to finally be able to run around outside.

After the first week it was our first garbage day. Everything neatly in closed bags and in our personal garbage container. In the morning we had to place the container on the side of the road with the rest of the containers on our street. So it was there at 7:00, after which I started cleaning my house. I had a white floor, because I liked it and that way I knew for sure that it was clean. I mopped daily. I was still extremely clean at that time because of crawling children. Then I did the shopping and when I got home I was in shock after opening my front door. My entire hall was full of unknown waste. Pieces of glass, sharp metal lids, pieces of food, cartons, plastics etc. Clearly stuffed through the mailslot. I already saw a number of neighbors looking at me expectantly behind their windows and in front of their house. It was clear that they knew more.  After asking around I was told who had thrown that garbage in my house. Conscious neighbor had done this with much fanfare.

Something snapped inside me. A bomb in my frontal lobe and all decency disappeared from my mind. Steam from my ears. 

I cleaned out the trash and put the kids in the living room. Then I cleaned the cat litter box. Normally I throw the entire contents in a bag, but now I was a bit more precise. I only scooped the shit and urine clumps out of the box and divided it evenly into 2 small bags. Those thin ones that tear quickly....

I took the bags and went to the neighbor further down the street. I rang the doorbell and kept the bags behind me. The lady opened the door with a smug grin on her face. The door opened wide and I could quickly see her hall. On the right a carpeted staircase, on the left the open door to the living room, the hall continued for another 1.5m to the back after the stairs and door, where the toilet was. Everything was super clean.

I asked her devilishly calmly if she had put that waste through my mailslot. Her answer was yes followed by the reasoning that because I was new here, that the loose waste that was lying around the placed containers must have been mine, because before we lived here that never happened. 
This was the moment that all the blood vessels in my eyes burst... the calm was gone.

In a tirade of abuse I made it clear to her that I had not been the polluter and that if she had any decency, she could have spoken to me instead of jumping to conclusions and dirtying my house and endangering my crawling children and animals by dumping that waste in my house like that. With the message that she liked to clean up so much, here please, and I threw the 2 bags in her hallway. 1 against the corner of the stairs and the other on the doorpost of the living room. Everything, really EVERYTHING was covered in shit and the splattered clumps of cat urine.  With a warning/promise that if she ever thought of doing something like that again I would smash all her windows, I turned around and went home. Everyone had seen and heard everything.

Never heard anything from that neighbor again, no one ever thought of doing something like that to me again.

I can still enjoy the face she pulled when she saw the bags flying. It was shock, fear, indignation, nausea and despair all at once.",4232,0.98,196,5155163,2024-09-08 02:19:29,1fbs3mp,4428,High
NuclearRevenge,"Throw me down a flight of stairs and destroy my relationship? Well, I hope you didn't like your life...","... As you knew it.


So a little bit about me before I go into this. And, before you ask about it, I am going to be *incredibly vague* about a lot of specifics; If you've ever worked in cybersecurity or for the government, you'd understand why I'm cagey.


I graduated from high school in the late 2000's. I tried college, it didn't work for me, so I enlisted like I had already planned to after I got an associate's. I got into the Navy, passed quals for the ""special warfare"" training block while in Basic, and after completion went and started training to become a SEAL, which I did not complete because that shit is no joke, but it's cool because I went SWCC instead, and became a ""dirty boat guy"". SWCC are the guys you see in movies arriving just in time with fast boats blasting lots of firepower at the bad guys so they can pull our boys out of hell. Sometimes they work with helo crews, or man the helos themselves. Most often they just patrol riverways in Iraq begging for someone to shoot at them to break the monotony.

That sounds way cooler than it really was; Aside from becoming an expert in all things small watercraft, and doing a good amount of diving and aircrew shit as well, I didn't get to do the cool SEAL shit. There's things I DID do while strapped to a SEAL team, but I don't think I can talk about that. No door-kicking, no breaching, no Team shit. Only on a handful of occasions did I even get into a firefight.

Side note: Most Youtube ""Special Forces Operators"" are former Team or Group guys who are full of shit and their colleagues did most of the heavy lifting. They just tell the stories from their perspective so ""somebody gets to tell it"" without divulging identities, etc.


Anyway, I got out of boat shit eight years in after being injured, and did my last four years of my 12 year career doing other stuff in special warfare, more cyber-oriented. I retired, collected my VA card, and went to school for couple semesters to bone up on shit I needed for some cybersecurity certifications, and I've been working private sector since early 2019. Got my own LLC and everything.


So this story actually starts in early 2016.

I had been back in my hometown for a while, which was near a major naval base. I had changed career tracks and was on med leave for a bit after my injury, so I had been able to take some time to reconnect with an old high school sweetheart of mine, and we had been dating for several months. She was my best friend growing up, and I absolutely blew it when I had the opportunity to take her to junior prom, and we didn't see much of each other after we graduated and I enlisted, so we'd grown apart and in the several years it'd been since we'd parted ways and reconnected she had had a kid of her own, an adorable little 3 year old girl, and ""daddy"" wasn't in the picture which was absolutely his loss because she was a gem of a child. We grew close quickly, and after a couple months she'd occasionally call me daddy which made my heart soar. And, as for her mother, I was head over heels for her years ago, and reconnecting with her only reinforced those old feelings because it took off like a rocket. We were inseparable for the first couple of months, and when we weren't going on fun play dates with her kid or acting like horny highschoolers after we'd send her to bed, we were texting eachother at work, tagging eachother in funny memes on Facebook, y'know dorky cheesey lovey-dovey kid shit that's embarrassing to admit to as an adult in his 30's now but... I mean, we were in love. Real love, something that, to that point, I'd never known like that before. I'd been shot at and stabbed, hell my whole injury was due to getting my leg blasted with a 7.62, but none of that made me more nervous and scared than this new love I was feeling.

I had it *bad*.

However, there was a complication in the form of her ""brother"", some lanky, inbred, wannabe gangster wigga boy, whiter than driven snow, who came in and started crashing on her futon a month and half into our relationship. This piece of shit had the highly unfortunate blessing of also being the kiddo's godfather/""uncle"". He had no blood relation to my girlfriend or the child, he was just some former tweaker who worked at the Target they both worked at who started crashing from ""low blood sugar"" (He was coming down from whatever he was high on) so she got him a cheeseburger and soda which, in the tweaker culture, is like being given a handful of gold. He was forever in her debt, and became her right-hand man, never wanting her romantically as he preferred trash similar to his own kind (Thank you, God). She referred to him as ""brother"", and he of her as ""sister"", so naturally he was ""uncle"" to the little one.

Which meant when he showed up in the middle of the night mid-way through our relationship, it was a very bad sign for me, because that homeless, now-jobless, feckless idiot was moving in.

Our ""friendship"" started out on a very ""suddenly bad"" note, because he was met by me and a .45 in his face wondering why a grown-ass-man was in my girlfriend's apartment while we were in bed, and I heard something going ""bump"". 

(Side note for any ""concerned citizens"", the kid was sleeping between us, and they didn't have any pets, so I knew whatever was making noise out there wasn't anyone in the room, and nobody else should've been there. Pair that with recent break-ins in her complex, and you can see why I was justifiably armed)

Now I did not live there. I had my own studio near the base, I just stayed the night often because it was convenient and fun. And with the recent break-ins, they also felt safer with me there, so win/win/win. So naturally I didn't have any say in anything regarding him living there. In an effort to placate the young whippersnapper after holding a fucking 1911 to his nose, I let him borrow my PS3 and a spare TV I had so he had something to do, because fuck him if he was gonna actually go out and find a job. Instead he smoked weed out on the balcony all day and played Need for Speed and COD on my Playstation.

This fucker acted like my girlfriend was his mom. Expected her to cook him food when she got home from work, expected her to take his laundry out and fold it for him, god he once asked her if she could re-lace his shoelaces onto his sneakers because ""she does it better"". The kid (He was 23) was a fucking loser, and beyond just being a live-in babysitter for the *actual child* when mom and I were at work (Because my med leave ended eventually), served absolutely no value. We'd come home to a messy kitchen and shit all over the apartment. Numerous times he'd leave a growler in the toilet and neglect to flush, and FUCK HIM for asking my girlfriend to do his laundry because I DIDN'T ALWAYS SEE TP IN THE WATER when I was the one to flush it. That man had an itchy asshole all the time, I guarantee it. He was good with the kid though, I will give him that. She never had a dirty diaper before she transitioned to the potty, so good on him for actually being a little useful.

And it was like this for four more months. Eventually, I was spending so much time over there that she and I were talking about getting an apartment together so we're not paying two leases. And of COURSE dudeguy was hitting us up for a ""spare room"", which we fought and argued about because four months after moving in, motherfucker still had no job. The guy who talked so much game about being a ""successful drug dealer"" in his late teens (lol), couldn't move LEGAL weed. He claimed to be a ""professional drift car driver"" but he nearly backed my car into a light pole FOUR TIMES the handful of times I trusted him enough to park it for me. And every single time we argued, or had a little spat, his choice of words were ""I'm gonna kick your ass, If I can't kick your ass myself, I have a whole bunch of friends who can and will"".

Now, I want to reiterate - I was NOT a SEAL. I did not go through the rigorous combat training the Navy teaches special warfare operators and Team guys. I learned SOME, enough to qualify you for Special Warfare... But what SEALs go through in BUD/S and their supplemental training schools, their individual specialty schools, and whatever clandestine shit the agencies and JSOC have them doing nowadays, was completely missed on my career track. We drive boats, we fly/fly in choppers, we jump out of planes, SOMETIMES we do a mission with a SEAL team but most of the time it's a partner force op or some kind of escort op in some territorial waterway we're not supposed to be in. Maybe we're pulling a few divers out of the murk and not talking about it the rest of the way to extract because it's ""one of those"" missions. There's a reason SEALs are also called ""frogmen"".

I was also injured, I could walk on both legs by this point but if my painers weren't working well enough or if the weather was bad, there were days I couldn't stand up straight without leaning on something. But the rest of my body was still in decent shape. I'd trained Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in the fleet. I practiced Kali and Silat with some Filipino guys I'd met on-base (They are why I love lumpia so much). I picked up different shooting stances like Center-Axis Relock, I went to CQB shooting courses thanks to my Navy career. I wasn't Rambo, but I wasn't a fucking slouch, either.

And I could kill this fucker with my bare hands, no 1911 necessary.

But I loved his ""sister"", and I wanted to marry her, and adopt her child. So I bit my tongue whenever he flashed on me. Weeks went by, every now and then he'd snap at me for some shit. I decided I'd had enough, and one night when I was leaving to head home I took my PS3 and TV with me. He loved that. He declared that I was ""banned from the apartment"", to which my girlfriend reminded him that it's her apartment and her rules, and that he needed to be respectful.

Then one fateful morning, maybe a week after that, I had spent the night and we were getting up early because I needed to be on base and she had to go to work, so we got out the door with the kiddo and just as we were buckling her into her carseat I realized I had left my wallet inside. So, I went back to the apartment and retrieved it, and as I was walking towards the front door Assfuck McGee pipes up with ""You're cleaning those dishes when you get back"".

Dear audience, ""those dishes"" were dishes he had dirtied the previous night when he made late night stoner mac and cheese and somehow needed a mixing bowl and four different wooden spoons to make it. 

I looked at them, looked at him, looked back at them, then back at him...

... And said ""you're high, clean them yourself, bitch, and don't ever tell me what to do again"", before doing the damned best about-face a man can do when low on painkillers and high on pain and salt, and walking out the door.

I was maybe six or seven steps down their stairwell when I heard the door fly open behind me, I turned to see him coming at me with both hands and he threw me the rest of the way down the stairs. I landed hard on my back, knocking the wind out of my body and hitting the back of my head hard on the concrete deck. My leg caught fire with fresh pain. Then he jumped on top of me, snapping me out of my daze and I went to work on him. I grit through the pain and started working to get on top of him, where I proceeded to rain hell on his face with my fists. I split his lips, I popped him in the eyes and the temple, I even gave his Adam's Apple a nice little tap, I was fucking furious and I honestly didn't care if I killed him in that moment, someone had to die and it was definitely not gonna be me.

But she saved his life a second time. She was wondering why it was taking so long, and when she heard the yelling she came running and found me on top and beating the gravy out of him. She screamed for me to get off, and I did. As soon as I did, his mouth started running... ""SISTER HE THREATENED TO KILL ME AND HE ATTACKED ME AND THREW ME DOWN THE STAIRS BECAUSE I ASKED HIM TO BRING BACK THE PS3!"", which she knew was fucking bullshit and the neighbor's security camera outside backed that up, but in that moment, she was livid, and rightfully so.

I took her to work. I took the kid to daycare. I went to base. I had to explain to my CO why I had bloody knuckles, and why I was holding a cold pack to the back of my head. They offered to call the police so I could press charges, I told them no. My CO damn near ordered me to call the police or he'd put me back on med leave - Which he couldn't do, technically - To which I replied that I'd rather be on med leave than lose my girlfriend for calling the cops on her ""brother"". It was made clear to me, under no uncertain terms, that I am a particularly *stupid* kind of asshole, and that that would come back to bite me in my ass someday.

Well he was right.

Basically, ""brother"" gave an ultimatum, that either I leave and she dumps me, or he leaves and walks out of her and her daughter's life, which to be fair to my ex, that loser had been the only constant male figure in her kid's life since she was born, so that would've been devastating for the gremlin and she wanted to spare her that kind of pain.

Which meant I got the axe. Honestly, I'd have rather taken an actual axe to the heart because what I actually felt was way worse. It's one thing when you're saying goodbye to the woman you love. But to have to also say goodbye to a sobbing little kid you wanted so much in your heart to adopt and make your own? I don't want to meet the man who can hold back the tears from that shit. That man scares me.

I went back to my apartment, I put together a little box with the toys and keepsakes and clothing items they'd left behind, and waited for the right time to bring it by her work.

I was a broken man. But that little fucker... He wanted to kick me while I was down.

Remember those ""friends"" he mentioned? Well, he wasn't lying, he did have some friends with rap sheets and bad intentions, and in the months that followed her and I breaking up he put them to work.

I woke up one morning to discover my car had been blocked up, the wheels taken off, my cat cut out, and they had spray painted slurs and swastikas on my car after busting out my windows. I wasn't Jewish, and I had been dicking his ""sister"" for the last six months, but somehow I was both a ""k!ke"" and a ""f!g"". What my insurance didn't cover, cost me $2500 in repairs. Police were called, a report was made, surveillance footage was useless though. Faces covered, they wore gloves so no prints, and it's not like they're rolling out the CSI to collect hair follicles off the deck for auto vandalism.

Two weeks later, an attempted arson attack on my front door. Someone wearing a mask and a hoodie lit a Molotov cocktail and threw it at my front door's welcome mat, and if it weren't for the apartment's fire sprinklers ACTUALLY WORKING, my apartment would've burnt down with me in it because I wasn't jumping from the 3rd floor balcony. That was a more serious crime, cops were very interested in solving it, but again. No useable prints, face covered for the camera, etc.

Then it was quiet for a month, my ex had reached out to me when she heard about the fire and I told her I fucking knew it was her ""brother"", but I didn't have any proof. She said she'd say something to him, and coincidentally, nothing happened again for a while, until I guess cops came around asking to talk to him because obviously I gave them his name as a person of interest. In the month and some change since our spat, she basically forced him to find some kind of work or she was going to kick him out, so, he had gotten a part-time gig at an auto shop in town that had a rep for being ""the one you don't go to, but fine to recommend to someone you hate"". They cut corners everywhere they could, so it was a perfect job for the fuckweasel, at least until the cops came looking for him one day asking about that fire. The owners didn't like having cops asking about their employees so since he'd only been there a week or two, he got the boot. He deeply appreciated that.

So, one night I am getting home from work. I had stopped at the gym on the way, worked up a good sweat, and got a bite to eat from the grocery store. I pulled into my spot in my Enterprise rental - My car was still in the shop - and walked into my apartment.

Real quick: While I was over 21, and legally owned guns, and had a concealed carry permit, on days where I was on base I did not carry my pistol. It's incredibly rare for anyone whose explicit job description doesn't include ""carries a pistol at all times"" to be allowed to carry a weapon on base. Since I'm not leaving a pistol on my car, and there weren't any places to securely store a weapon while I was working, I just opted to not take my gun with me. It's also why I did not have a pistol on me the morning Shitdick jumped me.

I was unarmed.

I lived on the third floor, there was a fourth floor above me and stairs leading to it. I heard footsteps coming down the stairs fast, and I turned to see four guys in hoods, masks and wearing gloves coming towards me. My door was open, so I dropped my groceries and tried to slam the door behind me. They got a foot in and managed to wedge through into my apartment.

What followed took place during a period of about fourteen seconds. The neighbor across the way - After the fire - got a security cam installed outside their door as well, so we know the actual time stamps down to the second.

I kept a loaded pistol tucked in a closet near my front door - Irresponsible, I know, but I was younger and more naive than I am now.

In the scuffle with the first guy who came through the door, I managed to reach my hand into the closet, find the gun, and push myself back and away to give us several feet of space. I remember very vividly seeing all four men in my doorway and hallway, the first guy I had just pushed having been body-blocked from falling backward and was starting to come toward me a second time. I raised my pistol, this one was a Sig P226 chambered in .40 Smith & Wesson, and just as I heard one of them shout ""GUN"", I started lining up shots and pulling the trigger. 

There were no limb shots, no ""shooting to scare them"", I didn't try to wing them. Body. Body. Head. As I had trained, as I had been taught.

The first guy went down, the second guy caught two of the through-and-throughs from the first guy before I plugged him in the forehead. The third guy stopped dead in his tracks before catching four center-of-mass, and the fourth guy was halfway out the door before I emptied the rest of my magazine into him through friend #3 and whatever I could see and aim at.

You might be thinking, ""OOPS! That fourth guy was running away, that's murder! You're a murderer!""

Well, the cops didn't see it that way, and the investigators didn't charge it that way.

Because he lived.

Now the first three recipients of my high velocity sleeping pills didn't. The first guy's brains were all over the second guy, the second guy's brains were all over my wall. The third guy's heart and both of his lungs were demolished by my .40 S&W, he was pronounced dead on the scene. 

The fourth guy was my ex's ""brother"".

Of the three bullets that hit him, one grazed his ass, the other thoroughly lodged itself in his right asscheek, and the third one hit him square in the spinal cord, right around the kidney area. Shattered his spine and completely destroyed his lucrative career in competitive breakdance and bicycling. He was paralyzed from the navel down. Had to have a permanent catheter to catch his piss and a diaper for what was now the most useful byproduct he was capable of producing. He'd never walk again. He'd never fuck again. And when he was healthy enough to be discharged from the hospital, he was locked up in prison, given three manslaughter charges since he caught the rap for his three buddies getting killed. He was also charged with conspiracy to commit murder, assault, battery, and he even caught the reckless endangerment charges for me discharging MY firearm in an apartment complex with another apartment across the hall from the open door I was shooting towards.

He was never going to breathe free air again.




I would like to say that this ended up happily ever after, that she took me back, that we got married and I adopted her little one and we had a couple spares of our own.

But she didn't. Within twenty-four hours, she declared that she was scared of me, that she did not want me anywhere near her or her child, that she'd call the police on me if she ever saw me near her home or her place of work - Which sucked, I liked that Target.

She called me a murderer. She accused me of ""siccing the cops on him"" to instigate a response, just so I could shoot him. She ignored the arson, the vandalism, the various threats he'd thrown at me in the previous months we were together.

I never saw her again. She blocked me on everything. Her family blocked me. She changed her number, she transferred to a different Target, and after a couple of months she moved to a different apartment in a different part of town. It has been eight years since the shooting and I still haven't heard from her. I know she's alive - Friends of friends informed me she got married in 2020, had a second kid, and is happy, so, more power to her.

I never got my happy ending. My white picket fence. Believe it or not, killing three guys, even for a person trained for war and conditioned for the possibility that one day he might have to do it, fucks with your head, especially when you consider it happened in your home and not in Baghdad or Abottobad. There's a huge mental and emotional disconnect and difference between killing someone ""for work"" and killing someone because your life was in danger.

I had PTSD, I couldn't touch any of my guns - Once I got them back - For a full year without having panic attacks. The Navy was great about it all, they aided with the investigation including that CO who called me the Apex Dumbass giving his statement of that morning I got jumped. I was offered the chance to live on base with protective detail until things cooled down, I declined.

Eight years, since then I've retired, I'm now working in the private sector, I have my own LLC making great money doing cybersecurity and site security consulting. Occasionally I go out boating. My partner of three years is the most love, supportive person I've ever been with. I know they have my back no matter who tries to kill me. We're talking about having kids before we get too much older. Life's good.

But you know what really warmed my heart?



Just the other day a Google alert I set up eight years ago triggered.

It was Skidmark McDipshit's first and last name, followed by the word ""obituary"".

It turns out someone in prison got sick and tired of the annoying whiteboy in a wheelchair talking so much shit and flexing on people, believing nobody would hit someone in a wheelchair.

They used the wheelchair to cave his skull in, and used their shoes to finish him off with a few good stomps.

Of course, it doesn't say that in the obituary, it says he was a bright and loveable lad when he was young, who fell into hard times in his early adulthood and landed in prison. The real surprise is apparently he is survived by a daughter none of us knew he had back then, so, sucks for her but I doubt she ever got a chance to know her spermdonor anyway. Honestly, that's for the best.


So yeah, sorry for the fucking novel, but I just didn't feel like leaving out any of the details that mattered.

I hope you enjoyed my story.",4181,0.96,342,[deleted],2024-09-07 03:18:59,1fb24tx,4523,High
NuclearRevenge,"Got fired, reported them to OSHA and destroyed a family business and made them leave town","So a while back I had been hired to be the marketing person for a family business. It was a fitness equipment liquidator that had been founded by a gold medalist Olympian. He had fallen into some mental health issues and had delegated his wife to take over the business. She didn’t have the experience but took the reins anyways and she and her children ran the place, albeit with some success. 

So this is where I come in. The first red flag I should’ve seen was that she was trying to screw over the recruiter by wanting us to do a side deal to pay me technically less but still more than I would’ve gotten without the recruiter as the middle person. But I was in bed and I didn’t think too much about it. 

The next thing was how embedded the family aspect was in this business, that there was basically no distinction between the employees and family and family affairs being wrapped up in their work environment too. But I was just happy to finally be in a space where I felt welcome and almost love bombed by the ceo who treated me like one of her own children, always lots of hugs and even kisses during good morning meetings as if we were coming downstairs for breakfast.

Meetings ended up turning into brainstorming sessions because the CEO’s children and the workers were so scatterbrained and didn’t want to commit to any specific plans of action and I was basically on my own when it came to any marketing of anything because nobody would actually participate if it came down to it. 

About a month or so into it, I get ambushed by the ceo and her daughter who was like the operations person technically or something. Both were wondering why we hadn’t achieved as much as I had wanted to and when I explained that I didn’t really receive much help or participation from anyone, suddenly it became all about blaming me for everything wrong and why sales were down and why nothing was exponentially growing as she had hoped they would. I explained what actions I had taken and that I was doing exactly what I said I was going to do, it wasn’t my fault nobody wanted to help when they said they would. It didn’t matter. They wanted me gone because they expected the moon in three weeks time with zero budget and zero help from anyone else. So I just left. 

I want to add I did a lot while there. I automated a lot of their processes that they were doing by hand, set up salesforce and slack, as well as setting up and handling zendesk and a ticketing system, and even automating a lot of POS processes so that from card tap to accounting, it was all smooth and seamless and I made tons of things very efficient for them and improved productivity while there. But none of that mattered of course. They wanted double the sales from basically social media posting and nothing else. 

While I was there I had documented tons of OSHA violations. Exposed wires where customers would walk. ADA violations. Customer safety violations. Forklifts operated with zero certification and no PPE and having employees standing on top of the forks just to reach the warehouse ceiling. With no safety anything. Structural violations. You name it they did landlord special type fixes and left things in often worse states than before. 

I made the call, and sent OSHA photos of what I had documented, which I had only documented in the event of needing to use it. Never actually expected it to come to that. But I did.

After talking with them it was explained to me that there was months’ long processes to get actions to be taken, even with evidence. The penalties for the violations I had evidence for were financially crippling fines I knew they wouldn’t be able to handle. And after a months of checking every now and then, I got confirmation action was taken. Then a couple months later I drove past the warehouse/showroom and saw that it was abandoned. Broken letters, overgrown grass in the parking lot, boarded up windows and doors, for lease, all gone and dilapidated. 

While I was placing those calls I was also reaching out to my realtor friend who is super good at what she does, saying that we should time it right so after these fines and penalties that she can drop literature off at their door until they’re convinced to sell. She didn’t do it in time but she did catch wind that the house had been sold and sold fast. 

Their website was 404’d, and they basically packed their bags and left. I still can’t believe it worked, but sometimes in life we have to accept that we are the karma that someone has coming to them. 

Goodbye Amy, wherever you and your family left to. we’re even.",4011,0.98,69,darling_darcy,2024-09-03 12:44:52,1f869if,4080,High
NuclearRevenge,"Aunt broke my model kit, so i took her everything *UPDATE*","Hey, im not sure if this is how updates are done in this subreddit but the shitstorm continued and some people were asking for updates so here it goes. Link to the og post: https://www.reddit.com/r/NuclearRevenge/s/q8DEx9G476


Well, the time judge gave my aunt to pay what she owed me came and went but she didnt make any payment at all so we legally had to push the case into legal collectment. Cops went to her house but she ""wasnt there"" (she was in her house, but didnt make any noise) so cops had to leave and get a search permit to enter to look for her. They found her inside, having sold her everything and ready to illegally leave the country to not pay anything and start a new life abroad. When they were apprehending her she attacked the cops, actually clawed the eye of one causing permanent damage and adding multiple charges to her file. She was taken to court again, this time for more crimes alongside not making a payment in time the court told her last time. İm not sure if i can legally list all the things she was charged with, but in the end she got 18 years and 9 months jail time with no chance of parola until the 15th year. And yes, since she had sold her everything to leave the country the court took the amount she had to pay us (recalculated to todays tax numbers and exchange rates) before putting the rest of the money in a account that her son would get when he is 18.


As for her brat in the first post i had told that when her husband divorced her he had gotten custody. Well the kids personality was so bad he took him to a psychiatrist which decided because of my aunts shitty parenting he was showing personality issues. He is now in a pre-military boarding school for troubled kids, which he hates completely. 


As for the money i would love to say i used it to get the parts necessary to remake that kit but i had to put it in a saving accounts. The goverment recently changed border tax systems, so the previous money became a substantial amount with the new numbers, like hilariously so. As much as i would love to spend it all on gunpla, i have to think about future so its gonna stay in a savings account getting  fatter by the day until i graduate.

NuclearRevenge,Kill my cat? Get smashed.,"This is a story from my childhood. I lived in a small suburban neighborhood in the 90s. We had two dachshunds we kept in a backyard fence, and three cats that just roamed our 1/8 acre corner lot in my subdivision. Of the three cats ""Magic"" was the matriarch. She was a big fat black cat that didn't really run from any neighborhood cats or dogs.

Our neighbors across the street had a pit bull that they would let roam the neighborhood. It was never aggressive towards me or my friends, but also was NOT a friendly dog. We just stayed away from it when playing in the woods.

One day that put bull charged my cat while I was in the yard playing. It began to whip it's head back and forth shaking Magic, and I ran in to get my dad. We didn't have a gun for home defense. My dad kept a four foot long galvanized steel rod that was about an inch thick next to the door though. Ive never seen him move that fast. He was on that dog in about five seconds flat. I remember seeing him strike the dog probably three times before it let go of magic.

My dad said ""Come here Doxie, we are going to the neighbors house."" He was pissed... Shaking. When I got closer I could see that the dog's skull was completely smashed. You could see blood and grey matter it was gnarly. It's eye socket was also smashed. He picked up the dead dog, walked with me to the owners house. The man answered the door and said ""What did you do to my dog!?"" And my dad said ""The same goddamn thing in gonna do to you if this happens to one of my kids."" 

They never got another dog, we never saw them again and they moved about a year later.

Edit - 

I might be lost. I felt like the nature of dragging the bloody dog back to the owner and threatening them with the same for killing the cat was revenge, but maybe not.

I also always get these comments about 'animal cruelty' and being a psycho or something when I've posted this story on Reddit before. I don't think you all understand how much this marked me. I focused on facts in this post, not feelings because the feelings are very painful. It was 30 years ago now, and I can still remember very minute details of the scene, and I remember going on a roller coaster from Terrified I was going to die, to scared my dad was going to die, to scared/sad about magic and the dog, to scared about confronting the parents, and then to a deep mourning for my favorite cat (even to this day it's the best cat I've ever had.)

Not sure why you expect this to be some kind of morality tale, it's just what happened.",2310,0.92,220,DoxieDoc,2024-08-27 22:57:20,1f30wty,2530,High
NuclearRevenge,"Decline to pay me after I help you pass your exam, have fun getting deported","So, this happened a couple of years ago during COVID when everything was online. A mutual friend (let’s call him D) reached out to me, absolutely desperate. He was on the verge of getting deported because he had already failed his coding exam twice. One more failure and he wouldn’t be able to stay in the country.

He knew I was good at coding and begged me to take the exam for him. He told me how his entire future depended on it, how he had no options left, etc. Feeling a bit sorry for him, I agreed—on the condition that he would pay me $500 for doing it. He agreed immediately, so I spent a couple of weeks preparing.

The exam was proctored over Zoom, and we set it up so that I could control his computer remotely while he pretended to take the exam himself. We pulled it off without a hitch, and he passed the exam. Afterward, we went out for drinks to celebrate (each paid their own share because I didn’t want him deducting anything from what he owed me).

Here’s where things went downhill. He gave me $100 upfront and promised to pay the remaining $400 in a couple of weeks after he sorted out his graduation stuff. Weeks turned into months, and he kept dodging me with excuses. After six months of this, it became clear he wasn’t going to pay me back. I gave him multiple warnings to pay me or I’ll report him but he kept taking it lightly and blocked me

I was pissed. I helped him out, and he completely ghosted me after getting what he wanted. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands.

First, I reported him to his university for academic misconduct. I explained in detail how I was the one who took the exam for him and provided evidence to back it up. They investigated and failed him retroactively, which meant he couldn’t graduate. Since his visa was tied to his student status, this basically screwed him over completely.

Some context : It was an anonymous tip off to the college with a fake email with all the proof,they called him and gave him a chance to retake exam on the spot but guy never studied and failed at the most basic stuff.

But it didn’t end there. He was still living in the country illegally, hoping to somehow fix things. I knew he had no way out, so I anonymously tipped off the authorities, saying there was an illegal immigrant involved in suspicious activity living in my area. They came, found out he was there illegally, and he got deported.

Context - As for deport I felt bit scared in case he tried to hurt me in some way so I made sure he never set a foot in there again

Now some mutual friends are saying I went too far, that it was a petty move to ruin his entire life over $400. On one hand, I feel like he deserved it for trying to scam me. 

I wouldn’t have mind if he came clean saying he doesn’t have money or financial capacity to pay and he was sorry I would have let the matters go without a hitch.

I posted on other sub (AITA) but started getting death threats,i feel like you guys here wouldn’t mind this 😈

NuclearRevenge,I hunted down my credit card thieves ,"
Cross post recommended several times in petty revenge, delete if not allowed:) Yesterday morning I received an email notification from my credit card company stating a transaction for $1500 at a medspa was declined, and another stating it was approved. I immediately called said CC company to report the fraudulent charge. Turns out, my card has had fraudulent charges over the past 3 weeks with purchases including various hotels in my area, eBay, gas station, self storage, and moving truck rental. I rarely use this card, the last time I used it in person was in February and last online purchase in 2023. Fortunately, my CC company flagged all recent charges and closed my card.

This morning, my significant other had a Dr appointment in the same city as a hotel purchase made yesterday. After the DR, BF asked me what I thought we should do today. I said, ""well you wanted to shop for some new shoes... or we can swing by this hotel up the street and see if the credit card thiefs are still there?"" The amount seemed like it would cover 2 or 3 days. So BF and I go to the hotel to see if the people were still checked in and to let them know the card was stolen and the charges would be reversed. Front desk lady was pissed. She was able to find the reservation by card number and noted that the person had ""kept changing cards"" to pay for the room. Of course they didn't tell me the room number, much to my bfs dismay (BF was hoping to get a room key to take their stuff..lol, right).

I called CC company and they asked me to call the police. I called the sheriff department and they arrived within 20 minutes! I was surprised they even came. I gave them my report, id, and credit card. The deputy asked if I wanted to prosecute- I said Yes! (But can I prosecute if my CC company is going to refund all the money anyway?) Then they went inside and spoke to the front desk who provided them the invoice. BF and I waited outside in front of the lobby. Then, through the automatic sliding doors I hear the front desk lady yell, ""that's him, he's trying to leave!""

Light Hispanic dude with a bull terrier and several bags gets placed in cuffs. He gets brought outside , searched and doggo gets cuffed to a trashcan. Then another little Asian guy gets brought out in cuffs. A third deputy arrives and brings out a fancy asian lady with a face full of fillers, two suitcases and a coach backpack.

Four officers start going through the backpacks on the hood of their car. We see passports, ID's, credit cards. They pull out a big credit card printing machine and a laptop. Then they pull out a big Ziploc filled with crystal meth and the cop exclaims, ""here we go!,"" and turns towards us to flash a smile. Two of them go back to search the hotel room and bring down two bags with more drugs, a scale, four car keys and a big wad of cash. Unfortunately none of the cars were in the parking lot and the perps said they had been traveling by Uber. The cops contacted one of the thief's friends to pick up the dog, who arrived pretty quickly. It was an older Asian dude with tattoos, flashy jewelry in an old luxury suv. Don't worry, we got his pics and license plates. All these guys seemed like characters out of The Brothers Sun.

The deputies then gave me all the paperwork and told me that one of the guys said they stole my card off of the Internet. I would have guessed that they used a scanner while I was at the fair a few weeks ago. I find that so weird bc I haven't used my card online in almost a year. Apparently they made a physical card that had a different name on it. 

Anywho, I walk inside to give the front desk a copy of the incident number and then I remembered something else. I remember seeing another transaction for a storage unit that was made yesterday and two charges at a rental truck company. I go back outside and talk to the sheriff and asked him if he wanted me to try to figure out where that was. I was able to track down the storage location to a city about 15 minutes away, but no can do on the trucks. I called the storage place and they confirmed that a payment was made with my card but would not give me the unit number. From there. The sheriff said that it was out of their jurisdiction and they would try to get a search warrant but that might take a while. However, it might be helpful if I made a police report with the other City. So with nothing better to do, I drove my ass over there and made another police report regarding the storage unit. 

That's it for now, will update if anything else happens. In the meantime I will call up the credit bureau to freeze my social security (?) tell my dog to be on alert and load magazines. Any other suggestions? Also, Copper asked if I wanted to prosecute... But that was before the drug bust... So do I need a lawyer? Thanks in advance.",3303,0.99,151,methodrn00,2024-08-15 22:37:08,1etexfl,3454,High
NuclearRevenge,A Mother's Instigation. A Daughter's Completion,"I have promised my late friend that I wouldn't share this story until at least a year after her death. That time has passed. And this is nothing short of beautiful. Cruel. But beautiful.

I'm going to switch to first person POV. This is the story as my late friend told me.

XXX

I was an only child to two loving parents.  Mom had a difficult pregnancy and an even harder labor. It was so bad that the doctor advised that they never try again. Because he didn't want his wife to die, Dad got a vasectomy that was successful. I was sad that I didn't have any siblings but I had a happy childhood until I was a young adult.

When I was in the middle of college, Mom was diagnosed with Stage IV HGSOC (high grade serous ovarian cancer). It's the most aggressive form of ovarian cancer and Mom's older sister and mom both died from it. We knew her odds weren't good.

I don't know what Dad was thinking. I really don't. But he started an affair with his coworker, a woman just a few years older than me. Coworker started integrating herself into my and Mom's life. She'd go shopping for us, keep the house in order, help me with homework and even sit with Mom when Mom was going through chemo and Dad and I weren't there.

And no, I had no clue. At all. I just thought it was Coworker being kind to a family going through hard times.

Mom fought. She fought hard. But the odds just weren't in her favor. One day, I was visiting her in hospice and we were playing Chutes and Ladders. Mom got real quiet and then she told me ""You do know your Dad isn't planning to reverse his vasectomy, right?""

I was surprised, wondering what she was talking about. ""Yeah, I know."" I said. ""Why?""

Mom just looked at me and said ""I think you'd best keep it in mind."" We continued playing and when I left for the night, I kissed her and she said ""You'll be fine on your own."" She died that night. I believe she knew she was going to die that night and didn't want to scare me.

Once again, Coworker was right by our side. She helped us plan the funeral, brought us food, helped out around the house...and slowly started moving her things in. It was like putting a frog in a pot of water and having the temperature raised. It was slow. It was gradual.

A year or so later, she had completely moved herself in and was part of our lives. I don't remember what made me suspicious enough to start digging. But start digging I did. I learned the affair began shortly after Mom's diagnosis.

I was sickened, furious and saddened. I took out my cell, ready to confront Dad and Coworker with the knowledge. But something else struck me.

See, during one of her visits, Coworker mentioned to Mom and me that she wished to have children with her fiancé. Mom \*knew\* that the affair was going on. And she trusted me to spill the beans.

But I wanted to twist the knife further...as a result I decided to play the long game. It was a gamble. One that had a good chance of not paying off. But it was one I was willing to take.

I kept my mouth shut. I watched as they courted, got engaged and married three years later. I squealed with delight when they announced their engagement to me, wore a proud smile on their wedding day and made a toast at the reception. I even took extra steps to hide test results from Dad's urologist in such a way that Coworker wouldn't find it but Dad would.

Believe me. I was internally screaming. I wanted the world to know the way they hurt Mom and me during her darkest hour. I got dangerously close several times.

But I said nothing, knowing the payoff would be worth it.

Time passed. We played happy family. I got married to my awesome Husband and had children. Dad and Coworker played doting grandparents but I knew from the pained look on Coworker's face that she was bemoaning her empty nest.

Just as I was beginning to give up hope, the day came.

Coworker and I had started the tradition of getting together for coffee shortly after Mom's death. We'd talk ""girl things"" (again, as I internally screamed). Laugh, cry, love, live. That sort of thing. That day, Coworker was sad and sullen. I could tell she had been crying. I asked what was wrong.

I couldn't believe my ears when I heard why.

She was struggling to get pregnant for years but assumed it was stress from work. Then her periods started coming fewer and farther between. She decided to go to the doctor and find out why. It turned out she was entering perimenopause and her chances of successfully getting pregnant had dwindled. The doctor told her, in essence, her childbearing years were over.

As I crooned sympathetic noises, Coworker said ""It doesn't make sense....we tried so hard to have kids...but I wasn't able to get pregnant. I don't know why.""

It was then that I knew it was time.

""You mean...Dad didn't tell you?"" I said.

""Didn't tell me what?"" She asked.

I was fighting every chance to smile as I tried playing the ""it's not my right to tell"" and ""I can't believe he didn't tell you"" cards until she practically begged me. I should've won an Oscar for my performance. I told her about the vasectomy and that Dad had no intention of reversing it.

You should've seen Coworker. She completely deflated like a balloon. Her shoulders slumped, she bowed her head and she sobbed in her hands.

I wanted to rejoice. I wanted to rub her face in it. I knew though that would make me look like the bad guy. So I hugged her and rubbed her back, telling her Dad was horrible for not telling her, that she deserved a different outcome and that he completely wasted her time. Again, I was fighting to not smile. When she left, I told her I would always be there for her...but I knew she wasn't going to be part of my life anymore. Why would she? I was the daughter of the man who betrayed her.

Once she had left and I was alone, I wept with joy and relief that it paid off but also deep sorrow that Mom hadn't been there to see it.

That was the last time I saw or talked to Coworker. A few weeks later, Dad called me in a fury. Coworker had packed her bags and left, slapping him with divorce papers. She yelled at him for not being honest with her that he had a vasectomy he had no intention of reversing. That he knew she wanted kids and that she had wasted all of her childbearing years. And that he had left it to me to tell her.

He then said ""How could you do that to us?! We loved you!""

I then said in a cold tone ""You and Mom did a good job teaching me how to keep secrets."" I hung up and that was it. I never spoke to him again either. Last I heard, he and Coworker were divorced and everyone shunned him because of his keeping the secret.

I know I won't be joining Mom after I die. What I did was cruel. It was horrible. I should've done what Mom wanted and spilled the beans beforehand instead of wasting Coworker's youth and childbearing years. Even if she could adopt, she'd probably die before her children were fully grown.

Although...it's hard to have compassion and mercy for a woman who integrated herself into my dying mom's life as she was screwing Mom's husband.

TLDR: My friend's father had an affair as his wife was dying of cancer. His AP wanted children while he had a vasectomy he had no intention of reversing years before the affair began. Friend waited until AP's chances of getting pregnant were nil before telling her about the father's vasectomy. AP filed for divorce and Friend cut off contact with both the AP and her father.",6380,0.98,279,AQuietBorderline,2024-05-26 01:21:47,1d0v6m3,6659,High
NuclearRevenge,Disrespect me? I’ll ruin your whole damn career. ,"TLDR: New boss decided to “put me in my place”. I decided that my place was somewhere else and that hers was in the unemployment line. 

So my old boss (beloved by all) left the company last year. While they were trying to find a replacement, upper management decided that the person in charge of another department should be our boss (for the time being, of course). This person, let’s call her Dina, does not have a single iota of what anyone on this team does. Nor does she want to learn what we do. Fine, whatever, just let me do my work, get my money, and leave me alone. 

This issue comes in when she suddenly decides that we are disrespecting her with everything we do. Not early enough to a meeting (15 minutes is her “latest earliest”)? DISRESPECT! Have to step away to use the restroom? DISRESPECT! Take your PTO that’s offered by the company? DISRESPECT! Finally, I have enough and start documenting every instance (with proof and witnesses) into a massive Excel sheet. At this point, sure it’s annoying and I’m passively looking for new work, but I’ve dealt with worse. 

The breaking point for me came during my Yearly Review. This is the first and (hopefully) ONLY time I’ve ever been put on a PIP plan. I was told repeatedly that I was lazy and disrespectful (despite SEVERAL clients providing positive feedback and me working until 22h most nights). But I keep quiet, I tow the line, until I have a new job. Then, I let the floodgates open. 

Now, something important to note is that while our former boss was great, we weren’t all going to quit in solidarity with her. But me? Well…that’s a bit of a different story. In addition to my job, I also worked to make my coworkers’ jobs easier too. I was kind of the “glue” holding that entire team together. So when I quit, everyone else on my team did as well. And what did our team do you might ask? Well, we supplied a service that brought in the majority of the revenue. With no one to supply the service, the business would head towards bankruptcy. 

Back to the story, when I put in my resignation, I decided to include the spreadsheet to provide further insight as to why I was leaving. And to top it all off, I decided to BCC the CEO. He and I are pretty close and he’s told me on multiple occasions that he would do anything to keep me employed there. When he found out about Dina’s antics, he held true to his word. Asked if he should fire Dina. Now, Dina may be a dick, but she has young kids and I’m not a dick. So I told him no, but if anyone else leaves because of her, then he should rethink her employment. 

Well my last day comes and goes…and the rest of the team puts in their resignations…effective immediately, citing disrespect from Dina specifically. With no team to manage, CEO decides that Dina no longer has a place at the company and decides to fire her with no severance. How do I know? Dina decided to spam call me for several days. But my new fancy job is at a law firm and I was able to get one of them to draft up a cease and desist. Haven’t heard a peep since and now I’m just enjoying my new gig, Dina free.

NuclearRevenge,Update: Threaten my friend with revenge porn? I'll ruin your whole damn life.,"So I have an update to this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/NuclearRevenge/comments/1bvc68q/threaten_my_friend_with_revenge_porn_ill_ruin/

Barely 12 hours later.

Before I get into the update though, I want to clarify a few things from my original post, primarily about the contact to the employer, and why.  Some questioned its truthfulness.  While the entire story is true, some details were omitted for various reasons.  There was more she/I had in our posession that did positively identify this individual.

So, would ""a lawyer"" contact his employer, like some stated would not be done?  Depends!  I did not do what I did on behalf of a client who retained me.  I did it as a *friend* to help a friend.  And as her friend *who is also a labor and employment law attorney* I knew exactly how to squeeze this.

And here's the thing.  I was absolutely aware, from the onset, that the ""revenge porn threat"" would go nowhere with his employer.  Even if I could clearly lay out how the person with *this screen name* was in fact *this person* who works at *this company* all we had are screenshots. If it was just the revenge porn threat, any employer would go ""well, thank you for bringing it to our attention, but even if we accept our employee uses this screen name, and we neither confirm nor deny anyone of that name works here, we have no provenance on this, this is just an alleged screenshot of an alleged conversation that could be easily edited and manipulated.  Please feel free to pursue this with local authorities and rest assured, should we be asked to, we will cooperate fully with any law enforcement inquiry, but we have no further comment at this time""

And I know that's what they would say *because that's exactly what I would say*.  An alleged screenshot of an alleged conversation that was allegedly sent under an alleged username that is allegedly one of our employees?  Whatever dude, call the cops if you're worried about it, we'll answer them honestly if they come to us.

The issue wasn't the revenge porn threat.  It was the picture of the contents of the work laptop.

Because that can't be faked.  There's no way for her or me to create a false image of the *actual proprietary information on his work computer* unless he sent it.  There's *no way* for me or her to have posession of images taken of his coworkers without their consent unless *he sent them*.

The proof here wasn't that this person broke the *law*.  It's that he sent pictures of *company employees and property* which would *absolutely* be verifiable by their IT department that yes, this is absolutely his laptop.

That's what would get him fired.

So I advised my friend not to block him, to sit back and wait and *not respond to anything* but let him dig himself in deeper.

And respond he did.  

Update:  he's been fired.  So, with now definitive proof that the individual in the online conversation is in fact this person, we'll forward it all to the local authorities in his country, along with his license plate number.  They're more than capable of getting his home address.",4252,0.98,219,furtherdimensions,2024-04-04 10:56:23,1bvqsj6,4471,High
NuclearRevenge,Threaten my friend with revenge porn? I'll ruin your whole damn life.,"My very good friend made...some slightly dumb mistakes and sent some pictures to someone that she reasonably thought she could trust, but not knowing much more than than his first name, his screen name, and roughly where he lived and the type of work he did.  He is not in our country but had indicated that he would be traveling for work to near us shortly, and they had made some plans to meet.

And when she got some red flags and backed out, the dude threatened to publish these pictures online.

I am, incidentally, an attorney.

So, some searching later, and gathering up any pictures he sent her of him, that could possibly identify him, his online handle let me to a TikTok page, which lead me to an instagram page with his name on it.

That lead to a linkedin page with his place of work that matched a picture he sent with a branded polo he was wearing.

Some more searches got me the email of the CEO, VP of HR, operations manager, and public relations manager.

I just fired off an email on behalf of my client of the screenshots of him threatening revenge porn, snippets of the conversation showing that username while he sent that exact picture of him wearing his company's branded apparel, links to how I know it's him, along with pictures he sent her of his motorcycle with the license plate showing, as further proof it is him.  I also included screenshots of him discussing a workplace incident that were time stamped, along with pieces of dialogue discussing how he had sex with an ex at his place of work, and discussing plans to have sex with her in his office as well.

I also included a picture he sent her showing his work laptop with his entire outlook calendar, along with proprietary information (which he sent to ""prove he was busy"") along with other pictures he took of his workplace with non-consenting employees.

I further informed his employer that I will be forwarding all this information to local (to them) law enforcement and since he had indicated that he would be traveling to the United States soon, will also forward this to the local office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as, since my client is a US citizen on US soil, these threats constituted a federal crime.  So that should they continue with his employment, and continue with their plans to send him to the United State for work, I will ensure, on behalf of my client that federal law enforcement is waiting for him on arrival.  Which I will do, as one of the assistant US attorney's for this region is a law school buddy of mine.

Since I have his license plate # I know where he lives, and will be contacting his local authorities tomorow.

You dumb mother fucker thinking you were hiding around anonymity thinking you could threaten my friend?  It took me 45 minutes to destroy your life.",6132,0.98,324,furtherdimensions,2024-04-03 21:41:02,1bvc68q,6456,High
NuclearRevenge,"Aunt broke my model kit, so i took away her everything.","This whole thing started exactly a year ago but just ended, and a friend told me to post here so off we go.

İ live in Turkiye, and as you know south east of my country was wrecked by a couple of giant earthquakes a year ago. My city was the epicenter, and while the house i lived with my family wasnt destroyed a lot of shelves got knocked off and one of them was the one where i held my Gunpla kits. Out of all the kits i had, only one survived  a MG The O that was heavily customised. İ had built it with my grandfather who passed away a few years ago, so i was ecstatic it survived. A few months after everything had calmed down so my mother called her relatives for dinner, which included Aunt B.not for bitch, her name does start with the letter B). She came alonside her son which is 8 and is an entitled brat. While the adults were drinking coffee this little brat barged in my room and demanded to play with my computer which i refused since i was editing a video for my college society and had the camera on. Well the brat went back crying to her mother who came and started yelling at me. While i was dealing with her her little brat climbed my desk and took my model kit then immediately dropped it and stepped on it. Rest is just yelling, me swearing them up and down and telling them they were gonna pay for it with her calling me a weirdo for still having ""toys"" and that she wasnt gonna pay for shit. My mother was as first a bit not into making her pay to keep peace, but when she realised it as the kit i made with my late grandfather (her father) she was angrier than i was and went out for blood. 


We took the case to a friend of ours who is a lawyer that specialises with in-family cases, and they told us since my camera caught it all, we would definetly win it but it was better to come to an aggrement out of court in a settlement since it ould be cheaper. İ pulled out a price list of the kits i needed to make an exact replica of the one that was destroyed and it came just about 1k USD which came to about 25k-27k TRY with the exchange rate. Well she refused so we took her to court. She pulled all kinds of bullshit to not pay and delay, but the judge ended up making her pay 1650 usd plus an order for her to pay any border taxes on the replacement kits alongside the court and lawyer fees. It completely fucked her savings and her husband who was already waiting for a chance to divorce her took it. When it all ended up she had nothing and even lost her brats custody to her ex husband and she not only lost the downpayment she had for a house she lost all her savings and didnt get alimony from her husband.


Am i happy her life got completely fucked? No not really. Do i feel sorry it happened? Not in the slightest. She and her crotch goblin fucked around and found out, its that simple. İ feel bad for her husband though, he is gonna be the one trying to make that brat into a normel person and i dont envy it in the slightest.",5442,0.97,166,Erenogucu,2024-03-25 03:01:40,1bn880i,5608,High
NuclearRevenge,"Neighbor Ruined My Garden, I Turned His Yard into a Swamp","Get ready for a wild ride, folks. This is the story of how my battle with a neighbor over my beloved garden led me to transform his pristine yard into a swamp, and in the process, I became a local legend.  
It all started when I moved into a new house, which came with a small but charming garden. Gardening quickly became my passion, and I spent months turning that space into a blooming paradise, full of flowers and a few veggies. My neighbors seemed to appreciate the view, all except one: let's call him ""Grumpy Greg.""  
Grumpy Greg was the kind of guy who took too much pride in his perfectly manicured lawn, the type that looks more like a golf course than a yard. He despised my garden, calling it ""untidy"" and ""an eyesore"" that attracted pests. I tried to reason with him, offered to keep it more contained, even suggested setting up a small fence. But no, Greg wanted it gone.  
One morning, I woke up to find most of my garden destroyed. Flowers uprooted, veggies trampled, and my small birdbath smashed. I knew it was Greg. No proof, but who else would it be? I was furious, heartbroken, but then, inspiration struck.  
I remembered Greg's one true love: his flawless lawn. I did some research and found the perfect, most diabolical yet completely legal revenge. I bought hundreds of ""water retention crystals,"" the kind meant to help soil retain moisture for plants. Except, I wasn't planning on using them for their intended purpose.  
Under the cover of night, I went to work, spreading these crystals all over Greg's precious lawn. These tiny crystals are harmless, but when they come into contact with water, they expand, holding many times their weight in water. And wouldn't you know, the forecast predicted a week of heavy rain starting the next day.  
The rain came, and the crystals did their job too well. Greg's perfect lawn transformed into a squishy, waterlogged mess. Every step taken on the grass felt like stepping on a waterbed. The lawn mower got stuck, and the yard had become the neighborhood's newest swamp.  
Greg was livid, blaming everyone and everything for his misfortune but couldn't prove a thing. It took weeks for the effects to wear off, and by then, his lawn never truly recovered.  
In the meantime, I rebuilt my garden, even better than before. Neighbors who learned about the ordeal (and Greg's role in destroying my garden) came to help, bringing plants, seeds, and even a new birdbath. My garden became a symbol of the community, a place where neighbors would stop by to chat and admire the flowers.  
As for Greg, he became a lot less grumpy, especially after I casually mentioned how ""unpredictable"" gardening can be and how it's ""important to have good relationships with your neighbors."" He got the message loud and clear.  
So, that's the tale of how I turned a bully's yard into a swamp and, in the process, united our little community. Sometimes, a bit of creative thinking (and a whole lot of water retention crystals) is all it takes to stand up to a bully and come out on top.",2693,0.92,86,BladianYT,2024-03-22 12:08:36,1bl4e40,2779,High
NuclearRevenge,Make up rumors that I have CP and I’m a prostitute because I won’t date you? Goodbye to your new $150k car and hello prison and a ruined life. ,"EDIT: since people keep saying this is not real because I called it a small town but it has a big school… when you grow up in the same town with the same kids and same siblings and same families and same houses and jobs and clubs and sports… for 18 years straight, it gets small and feels small, sorry it’s not a population of 3 and dropping. Further, you ~could~ easily find the article about this crime, proving it did happen if mods need proof I have it all. 


TLDR at bottom, if this isn’t enough for this sub let me know and I’ll move it but been a long time lurker. Characters: Me (18M) unmedicated senior. Psycho Incel, referred to as PI (m16). So for backstory I was the only gay kid in what felt like my entire small deep south southern town, and came out very young so that identity kinda stuck. My family was mostly very supportive and I’m grateful for that because outside of 2-3 friends I might as well have had a scarlet A branded to my forehead.

 Eventually though a few other people came out, one being PI,a very wealthy spoiled all american entitled kid who drove a very, very expensive new car. Now when he first came out it was to no one’s surprise, but regardless a mutual friend was worried it would be a hard time, and asked if I would befriend him, give him tips on how to get through it etc, I of course said yes (Big Mistake). Now by this time I never cared what anyone thought because the people who mattered had already made it apparent and vice versa, so, I was pretty open about the fact that I was actively dating someone much much older than me (I don’t want to hear it that’s not the point of the story and it was a wonderful and healthy relationship that my conservative traditional dad even supported so shut up). 

Now, after getting coffee with PI and being friendly he apparently developed feelings for me, and after he confessed, I gently told him I was seeing someone and that I was very happy (this was common knowledge in our gossip ridden highschool anyhow) and that was apparently not acceptable to PI and he went ballistic. In small towns there are often what’s known as junior senior wars, where the two grades have a war of harmless albeit annoying pranks. However, our school was not completely uncivilized, so there was a group chat for both grades to discuss rules, limits (such as no damaging, no hitting houses if someone expressed that they weren’t participating, renting etc). Well in that group chat with over 1,000 kids PI thought it would be a great time to drop bombshell number one. 

I had expressed that I was not participating, to not hit my house it’s rented, and so on and so forth. Cue PI responding directly and saying “What you can’t afford to buy it with all the money you’ve been making being a prostitute for your 50 year old boyfriend?” (I would like to say first off, my boyfriend was nowhere near that age!). I saw red. I love that man to death and felt a forehead vein practically hemorrhage. Safe to say the rumor passed throughout the highschool and the community. My coaches took me aside, our extra religious teachers tormented me more, and I was a pariah. Oh well, I had acceptance to a top university, my friends, boyfriend, and family. I was almost done. Then the next rumor dropped and this is when I went nuclear. 

One day, I got a call from my friend, and immediately I knew something was wrong. Apparently little PI had decided it was a good idea to lie and tell people I had, 1) cheated on my boyfriend , 2) made a video with him and 3) it was with a junior, someone under 18. None of which was remotely true. Thankfully he was very popular and very straight, and also was an obsession of PI’s and knew where it came from, and he agreed to, in writing express none of this was true, and gave me copious amounts of evidence (screenshots of texts, instagram dms, etc of PI’s online harassment). I kept all of this in a file just in case this ever got out and I needed to defend myself (and thankfully it never became more than a funny impossible salacious story made up about me). However, it was too late for him, as I was already very mentally unstable and this would have ruined everything I was riding on. NOW onto the revenge (finally). 

So not only was PI’s car brand new, but it was a new car because he had destroyed his old one and was not getting another (love small town gossip but also driving through someone’s house is pretty conspicuous lol). Now, I’ll admit I did not come up with this, I read it in a fanfiction, but it actually worked out very well. First thing I did was go to the furthest bait and tackle shop I could find and bought catfish bait. Now, if you don’t fish you might not know, but catfish love the stinkiest, smelliest bait you can find, and I bought a whole jar of the slop. I knew the parking lot of my school had no security or cameras because my car had already been vandalized ( I did embrace the f word carved into my door with pride eventually). 

And then, I got to work in the cold February morning. First thing I did was hammer nails into three of his tires. Now, this wouldn’t pop them immediately, but they would eventually each deflate at much more inconvenient places and nails would look more accidental than if they were slashed. Then, I took poison Ivy and rubbed it all over the door handles of his car. Afterwards, I took a mix of gravel and vaseline and spread it all over the windshield wipers, which would just scratch the hell out of it once he used them. My FAVORITE however was using the catfish bait. Knowing enough about cars (i.e. copious googling) I figured out how to get to the AC portion and poured in the catfish bait. Sadly, I wouldn’t be able to witness this but, he wouldn’t be using his AC for another month or so since it’s still cold. All that time for it to rot, fester, congeal, and the first day it’s warm and he decides to blast AC his car will be filled with the fumes of a thousand rotten piles of roadkill and low tide without any idea where it’s coming from or how to get rid of it. 

The next part of this story is honestly out of pure dumb luck, and I can’t claim complete responsibility for the universes’ work. However, I, being the obsessive paranoid type, would check his socials from a burner account now and again (perhaps hoping to hear about his fishy car or to see if he aired out more rumors about me). One day I found something odd: nothing. Every single social media was gone. Out of pure curiosity I googled his name, and found something very juicy, and very crazy. He was arrested in an entirely different state for attempting to impersonate a government official and bring a gun into a theme park. Safe to say that didn’t fly, but it also did not get enough traction as I would like. And thus, I sent it to everyone I knew in our small town, his summer job, future college, our highschool, that giant group chat of over a thousand people? Yeah, got sent there as well. By the end of the day he was a pariah, jobless, and collegeless. I left my town, and honestly haven’t heard anything about him since but I can’t imagine he amounted to much being that insane, and with that type of crime as well. 


Tldr guy is mad I wont date him, tells my town Im a prostitute because of the age difference, then further tries to tell people Im a p*dophile, so I destroy his car and ruin his reputation. ",3313,0.93,150,tristanprentiss,2024-03-12 22:49:38,1bdhw5f,3463,High
NuclearRevenge,my neighbor destroyed another neighbor’s business because she abused kittens,"So I’m not sure if this goes here, this story is only minimally about me and I’m barely connected. Just let me know if I should post elsewhere. 

So a few months back I found my cat Jiji on the street. He was so young, maybe a couple months old, so I felt as if I couldn’t just leave him there. He also looked extremely malnourished and it was so heartbreaking to see. Just in case he was an escaped kitten, I posted flyers all over the neighborhood and on lost pet forums for my area. Absolutely no one contacted me so I took him to the vet and registered him as my pet (vaccinated, chipped, and neutered when he was old enough). When I first found him, I thought he was a Russian Blue. He looked exactly like them down to the face shape and eye color. As he got older, the stripes he has never faded like breeders said they would, so I abandoned the idea that he is a Russian Blue. Besides, it’s downright preposterous that an expensive breed of cat would be abandoned like that, right? 

Out of curiosity, even though he’s legally my cat now, I decided to check the neighborhood watch and lost pet forums. Thats when I found a post from one of my neighbors going absolutely nuclear on another neighbor, exposing her and her business. I’ll call the nuclear neighbor Daisy and the total waste of air Karen. 

From what I read on Daisy’s post, she feeds the local strays. There’s one in particular, a tabby, that liked to hang out in her lawn. Her nextdoor neighbor, Karen, is a cat breeder, specifically for Russian Blue cats. Karen hates Daisy because she feeds the strays and was worried about them ruining her business. One day, Daisy hears screaming coming from Karen’s house, sounds of objects being thrown, general commotion. She stepped outside, ready to call the police believing it to be a domestic disturbance. Instead, she watched Karen chase the tabby out of her house, smacking it with a broom and trying to kill it. They get into an argument, which prompts Daisy to write about it for the first time on the neighborhood watch. 

About 4-5 months later, there’s more disturbance at Karen’s house. Yelling, screaming, bumping around. Once again, Daisy steps outside to see if they need help and sees Karen angrily stomping out of her house with a box. She walks down the street a bit and Daisy discreetly follows her. Karen reaches the tiny playground in the neighborhood and throws the box into the bushes. Daisy goes to the bush and sees a bunch of kittens in the box, around the box, and in the bushes. She tries to grab them all but a couple run off and she can’t catch them. Daisy is pissed, brings the kittens that she managed to catch home, and goes to confront Karen. Karen is also mad at her, blaming Daisy’s feeding of the strays for losing her thousands of dollars. The tabby that hangs out around the house apparently got Karen’s cat pregnant and she couldn’t sell the kittens because they’re not purebred and it’s obvious.

After their argument, Daisy takes the kittens to the vet and most have injuries; broken tails, injured ribs, etc. Once Daisy got home, she reported Karen for animal abuse and then started to expose Karen online. Everywhere she could, Daisy told people not to buy from Karen, even going on to her breeder page and exposing what she did to the kittens. From what she knows, Karen completely lost her business. Despite this, every month Daisy will post about Karen and warn people not to buy from her just in case. 

Now I’m not sure if Jiji is apart of the kittens that came from that, he could very well be just a gray tabby from strays, but the timeline matches up. I’m not sure if Karen is or is going to face legal charges for the abuse she did to those kittens, but I sure damn hope so.",1669,0.98,71,[deleted],2024-02-14 12:30:39,1aqu088,1740,High
NuclearRevenge,Dealing with a fellow student that was causing most of us grief,"This occurred when I was in college back in the 1990s.

I was attending a private college in Canada that was quite famous for its program. It was tough to get in, had limited seats, and was an accelerated course. Classes were 830-17:00 Monday-Friday (mix of lab and classes) and 900-1300 on Saturdays for one of the labs. Without fail, after the 1st few weeks, people were getting accused of cheating because they were handing in labs that were the same as others had.  EVERY lab was unique, so there could be no duplication. The profs would assume that the 1st person who handed it a particular lab was the one who did it and that anyone else who did it was cheating.

Over a few months myself, one of my roommates and several of our friends(around 8) had been warned about cheating. A few were blamed twice, and their mark was recorded as 0 for that lab. One was expelled for a third occurrence. 

To say that we were upset about this was an understatement. The courses were hard enough without having to deal with a zero or being kicked out. It took us a bit to work out who was doing it. What we found out is one of our classmates would make a copy of someone else lab if they stepped away (ie to go to the bathroom) and didn't get someone to guard their papers. We went to the Profs and admins and they wouldn't do anything as we didn't have definitive proof, and said it wasnt possible as he had been caught for cheating once too.

What do a group of over-achieving, pissed-off nerds do? Revenge!  


One of our friends followed him to his home one night, he lived 30-40 min outside of the city. Once we had his address, we came up with a plan. If he cant get to class, he can't copy our shit. A trip to a hardware store for some supplies. We went there at 3 am a few days later. Once we got to where he lived, we put his car up on blocks, deflated, and cut open a large hole in the top of the tires, they filled them with quick set post cement that some of us had been mixing on the drive there. after 20-30 min we took his car off the blocks and left.  Note it takes about 5 gallons to fill a tire :)

&#x200B;

He didn't show up to class for a few days, due to ""car issues"" but he was back late that week, and few a few weeks it looked like he learned his lesson. Then he somehow copied my roommates (for the 3rd time) and my roommate got the boot.  He was livid, all of us were pissed off. so we went with a new plan. Roommate wanted to kill him. Took several hours to get him not to. 

I spent a few evenings getting some things prepared several of us were making and drying copious amounts of rust. well a few were filing down some aluminium fence tension bars. I mixed them together is a specific ratio and added a few dozen chunks of Magnesium ribbon, put it all in a mason jar, went for a visit at the end of the week. The roommate placed the jar on the hood of his car, stuck some Mg ribbon into the top, lit it, and ran like hell to where we were parks a block away.   


And that was that Those of us still in school were mostly able to graduate with a tech diploma or technician and technologist diploma. The problematic classmate only came back one time to get all of his stuff that was at the school. He talked to a few people in the class trying to figure out if someone there had did it or if it was someone else (apparently he had pissed off a lot of people over the time he lived there)  


He said the car was totaled. Insurance didn't pay out due to having only PLPD. Couldnt afford a new one. The town he lived in was going after him for the damage to the road from the thermite. Land lord had asked him to leave as well due to him being the target of vandals.

NuclearRevenge,"My fiancé cheated with several men, including a sex offender, so I took my revenge!","After being asked by many people why that wasn't posted to Nuclear or Pro Revenge I have decided to try again. Moderators at pro explained why it didn't qualify and suggested Nuclear but it never posted after my submission.  I think maybe it was because my account was only days old, so fingers cross it works this time.


I met my ex in 2012, right after I had just turned 30. I had only dated and been with women exclusively until I came out as bi-sexual at 28. Let’s just say the year I was 29 was a busy year making up for what I missed out on. It was mostly casual hookups (yes, safe) and I did try dating 2 different guys for a few weeks, but it just never worked out or got serious. I kinda figured that I’d probably end up marrying a woman or not getting married at all because I just didn’t see myself catching romantic and sexual feelings for a guy. Then I met Ryan. From the first date it was just like the only other time in my life I had fallen in love…butterflies, constantly thinking about him, wanting to spend every moment with him. He fell for me hard too and we became an item, though he did say while he considered my bisexuality a turn on, because he had a thing for straight guys, it also gave him pause because of my desires for the opposite sex and his concern it may lead me astray. I thought about it and understood it was a legitimate worry, but assured him that I couldn’t even think about anyone else because I was really into him. Note: I knew he was the one by the end of the first month and I was in love, but I wasn’t going to say these things too soon and risk scaring him off.


On our first date he admitted to me that he was legally blind due to a genetic disorder and that it was progressive and eventually he would only have a sliver of his peripheral vision. He immediately said he understood if I didn’t want to see him again because no other guy had wanted to date him and be his driver all of the time. I grew up with a brother in a wheelchair who never learned how to walk or talk due to misdiagnosed meningitis at 6 months old back in the 70s. I told him that and said that what my brother had was a severe disability, so in my perspective, his blindness had no effect in my feelings and that always being the driver was a small sacrifice just to be with him.


The following years were bliss. We brought out the best in each other. My family who was surprised, but very supportive when I came out, adored Ryan and treated him like family and said that I acted happier since we’d been together. When I met him he was working part-time in retail and had done very poorly in high school because he lost a lot of his confidence as his vision deteriorated. I told him that one thing I did insist on was that he do something with his life because he had too much to offer and that I would help. He said that he’d wanted to be a teacher but didn’t think someone with limited vision could teach….nonsense. So I put him through community college for 2 years, then 2.5 years of a local university and finally the 1 year teacher certification program as required by California. I drove countless miles and paid hundreds in public transportation costs for him, never blinking an eye or complaining.


We’d been together for 7.5 years and were engaged to be married in October by the time he was in his last semester of his teaching certification which involved him student teaching at his former high school with his favorite teacher from his days in school. Then the pandemic hit and schools closed. Fortunately he’d had enough hours in the classroom that he would still qualify to be certified after the Governor issued a waiver via executive order. On the 3rd day of the stay at home order in March my life crumbled when I innocently found out he had cheated on me with an ex all because he handed his phone to me to show me something on Instagram. I accidentally fat thumbed the back arrow when he gave it to me taking me back to a list of all his messages. I looked and recognized the name of his ex, Jonny, as the second message, dated a week ago. I clicked on it and my heart sank. Directions to my house, pictures, dirty talk, and reassuring Jonny not to worry about me because he had my location on my “Find My Friends,” just in case I came home from work.


I immediately started screaming demanding to know everything and he admitted to having his ex over twice for sex and that they didn’t use protection (Jonny was engaged to his gf during this, adding another victim). Then he admitted to sleeping with his straight but curious recently single cousin Tyler, twice, again no protection. Finally he admitted to sleeping with a supposedly straight guy named Tomas that he and many of my cousins went to school with who I told Ryan I really didn’t like him or want them talking because I didn’t trust him after what I'd read about him. Since they were never close friends I didn’t feel like this was a big sacrifice or that I was being too controlling AND I assumed that he knew why I (and all my cousins) felt that way, but didn’t bother repeating it. The reason was after high school at age 20 this guy was convicted of sexual assault and penetration with a foreign object against a 16 year old girl and had gone to jail and required to register as a sex offender for life. Apparently my ex was the only person in his graduating class that hadn’t heard that news. All of this happened in my home while I was working. We spent the whole weekend crying with me asking over and over why and him repeatedly crying and saying he just didn’t know and that he felt terrible.


Monday comes around and anger started being as common as sadness and I made a comment that said I was going to pull all the phone records going back the 3 years that AT&T kept them (for a fee). Only when he heard that did he admit to one more guy. Some random named Frankie off the gay hookup app Grindr who was the first guy he cheated with and continued to casually hookup with for nearly 2 years with the last time being in February (the month before). He told me how it started. Get this – it was the DAY AFTER his graduation with his BA in May 2018 and he was drunk from celebrating and wanted to have sex. I too had been celebrating with him and said I was too drunk to perform and said I’d make it up the next day, then passed out asleep on the couch. Apparently he was “angry horny” because he downloaded Grindr, chatted with this Frankie fellow and arranged to have sex in his car in a church parking lot across the street from our condo (which happens to be across the street from a school…this fact is important later), all while I slept on the couch. All the times they hooked up after that was again in my condo while I was working or visiting a friend for the night up the coast (he used to love going but started saying he couldn’t occasionally because of “homework” and “studying.”


I absolutely lost it, told him to get in the car and I drove him to his family’s house so he could tell them what he did so they understood why he was moving back into their house. While he was in the house I was in the driveway on the phone with AT&T ordering the 3 years worth of detailed call/text logs, then made an appointment to be screened for STIs. I suspended his service until he could figure out how to pay for his own damn phone, then I temporarily changed all his passwords on the social media accounts he cheated with and to make sure he couldn't hide more evidence so only I would have access to his cloud (we shared each others passwords on his suggestions years before). I also called the bank and issued a stop payment on his final tuition check that I had sent to the certification program the week before and hadn’t hit the bank yet. Before deleting his social media, except Facebook, I took screenshots of the entire Instagram conversation with Jonny the ex and mailed the conversation to his fiancée, who deserved to know so she could see a doctor and get tested too. His family was very religious and had kicked him out in high school for 3 days when he tried to admit he was bi and only took him back in when he took it back. Needless to say, she ended it, he got kicked out. ONE DOWN.


He came back out to the car and we went home. I took his house key and told him to say goodbye to our 3 pets and get packing. The entire time he packed I studied those phone records to find out dates, times and if there was anyone else he was leaving out. He answered every question I asked and it was then that I discovered that Tomas the sex offender and he had only had oral sex in my home and that the actual sex was in the same parking lot he screwed the Frankie guy in.


The wheels started turning and the next day I walked over to the church and sure enough spotted a camera. I spoke to a secretary (sweet old lady) at the church and informed them about a registered sex offender having sex in their lot and that not only was it a violation of his parole for indecent exposure, but that he was not allowed to be that close to a school and I provided the date. I was in luck! They had a digital two year loop system that started deleting day by day after it had been retained for 2 years. It was April 2020 and he first cheated with Frankie in May 2018 and the sex offender was in April 2019. I told them I was filing a police report and that probation would require a copy of it eventually. They said they would save the file and allowed me a thumb drive of both days to submit with my police report. Within a month Tomas the sex offender was locked up again. TWO DOWN.


I also filed a police report against the Frankie guy. The police said it was a relatively minor infraction but since it was across from a school playground and skate park they would follow up but there would be no jail time. I researched the hell out of Frankie and called him to confront him. He was smug and admitted to knowing about me the whole time. What he didn’t know is that I had found out he had a job that required a security clearance and he had several judgements against him and collection agencies had been looking for him (best $ I ever spent on a data collection site). I didn’t know why they couldn’t find him and just garnish his wages, but it ends up he was Hispanic and had two last names and was a Jr., plus he frequently by his middle name Francisco, Frankie for short…so he got lost in the paperwork confusion. I sent a letter to the collection agencies providing his employer and current location and contact info and then sent a copy of the police report about misdemeanor indecent exposure for which he pled guilty and it was a fine with community service (not considered a sex crime). His wages did get garnished, but only for two paychecks because the misdemeanor was enough for him to lose his security clearance and get fired. THREE DOWN.


Then I contacted Ryan’s family on his mother’s side pretending to be him from his Facebook account making sure they knew he had fucked his cousin Tyler. It spread through the family like wildfire and soon Tyler was contacting me because he couldn’t get a hold of Ryan to ask why he would expose what they did. I just laughed and said you shouldn’t screw your cousins, especially when they’re engaged and that he’d messed around in my house, so now it was my turn for payback. FOUR DOWN.


Lastly, I had already stopped payment but since he was so close to finishing I was sure his family would bail him out and pay the university. Like I said, indecent exposure is usually a slap on the wrist type misdemeanor. However, I remembered some of the paperwork he signed to be a mandated reporter that you could lose teaching certification for “documented acts of moral turpitude.” I sent a copy of both police reports from the parking lot with still shots from the security footage clearly showing Ryan’s face to the school district he’d been student teaching in and a copy to the Commission on Teacher Credentials. FIFTH AND FINAL DOWN!


Admittedly, I did all this out of anger but he shattered my sense of self-worth and made me incredibly bitter and untrusting after years of being generous and supporting him. Everywhere I looked in the town I thought of Ryan and the cheating. I felt a terrible energy in my condo knowing it all happened there. I stayed 9 months and watched all 5 of their lives self-destruct. Then sold my condo (making a nice profit) and relocated to the PNW to start over. One thing that is sad is I found out just recently that his ex-who’s fiancé broke up with him ended up committing suicide several months after I moved. It is too bad that his family was so closed minded to turn on their own son, but in the end, it’s not my fault that he cheated on his fiancé by coming into my home at my fiancé’s invitation to cheat. Suicide is never the answer to ones problems and I hope the fiancée he cheated on doesn't blame herself and that only his family does (as they should).


TLDR: I emotionally and financially supported my ex through college and his teacher credential program for over 7 years only to discover he had cheated on me with 4 different guys, one of them the day after he graduated and then occasionally for nearly two years in my home while I was at work. I took my revenge: My ex lost his career before it even started and our relationship, one AP (affair partner) lost his job and had bill collectors after him, another lost his fiancée and was kicked out, a third was humiliated when his entire family found out he had sex with his cousin and the fourth was put in jail for a violating probation. Lesson: Don't Cheat and Deceive or Fuck Around and Find Out.


UPDATE: For those that haven't seen the original posts comments, yes, I did seek therapy. This was 4 years ago and after 18 months of therapy that didn't really help, I was referred to a newer therapy for PTSD called Ketamine Infusion Therapy and it was like magic. In 6 sessions over 3 weeks I was relieved of all my pent up anger and resentment and actually able to trust and date again. I am now happily married and settled in the PNW.",3226,0.97,211,Revenge_served_cold8,2024-02-02 10:02:14,1ah72kp,3437,High
NuclearRevenge,Have An Affair On My Friend... NOPE!,"A childhood friend that was the most empathetic, kind guy I've ever know did a hitch in the navy, went into computers, and played guitar in a band married a 'Pretty Mean' girl that liked the idea of a big wedding and musician husband, but had no interest in a marrage. She was her family's golden child, drop dead gorgeous, and completely narcissistic spoiled. 

They buy land. He borrows money and has his family build their house to reduce costs, he was paying them back over time while she spent money and socialized, sometimes working a part time job. 

Inside of 2 years she's bored and starts an affair (or we think never stopped affairs) but gets caught and while the empathetic guy tries to work things out, she makes false accusations of domestic abuse and files for divorce, with restraining order keeping him out of the home he and his family built with their own hands. 

Now keep in mind he's still paying his family back for the home, still ordered to pay for the land, and most of the upkeep/maintiance, he's back in his childhood bedroom while his wife entertains her men in that house.

With some research by the lawyer, the family still technically owned the house...

Now, my family owned a heavy equipment business, including house/structural movers.
(Look up house movers to verify what I said) 

When she went on vacation with her family and new boyfriend, we went in, jacked up the house and drove off with it... REPOSESSED! The structure wasn't covered in the court order, just the mortgaged land. 

She had legal claim to the land, her name was on the mortgage, but the structure appeared nowhere on the deed, and there was still money owed on most of the materials/labor, so it was simply reposted.

Now, the judge wasn't happy at all, but it wasn't illegal to repossess since the land mortgage was the only thing he was court ordered to pay. 

She came home to foundation, pipes & wires sticking out of the ground, and a crappy used yard barn with her personal possessions in it...

Now, it wouldn't be 'Nuclear' if it stopped there... since the main character has recently passed away, I can tell more...

We had a guy we called 'Big Bob', and the name fits. Everyone probably knows someone that defies jail, death, is a walking demolition crew, and in fact we called him 'Demolition Man' for a while after the movie.

Apparently *Someone*  put huge dildos smeared with dried whip cream crust in her possessions found when her dad and friends came to get the rest of her possessions out of the yard barn. There were also extreme insertion porn and beastality porn magazines, bongs shaped like cocks, etc. 

*Someone* used her pictures in the 'Dating' magazines (pre-internet) for a paid escort with her phone number. Her parents even had to change their phone numbers a few times...

*Someone* got those change of address cards from the post office and sent her mail around the country. 

*Someone* knew exactly when the legal separation happened, and she was supposed to get her own car insurance, but she didn't get that letter. Her car burned down in her workplace parking lot a few days after the legal separation happened, and of course, she didn't get the insurance company notification in the mail, so no insurance.

*Someone* had intimate pictures printed, man's face blacked out on fliers, the printing pointed out that WASN'T her husband at the time and stuck them under windshield wipers at her family's church, everyplace she worked, all around her neighborhood... Cops got involved in that, but they couldn't find where the fliers were printed... Big Bob was an over the road truck driver...

Everything died down when she finally agreed to let our friend buy her out on the land for a reasonable sum (paying for it twice) and drop the restraining order...

Less than a week after he had clear title the house showed back up right where it was before. Since it was still on the steel used to move it, all we had to do was stick a truck back under it and take it back, hook it up. 

This was until she decided to marry a guy from a hard working family that were doing well... She 'Love Bombed' the poor, hardworking sap, he never knew what hit him...

She had a bachelorette party with her 'Pretty Mean' girlfriends at a local recreation lake and rubbed it in her bachelorette party was going to cost more, be better than her wedding to my friend...

I think that's what qued the nuclear revenge.

The fliers showed up all over at his bachelor party (at his parents house with his family), and her bachlorette party got busted for drugs where they found several people in various stages of undress including the bride to be and quite a bit of drugs, bunches of alcohol, etc. 

When that wedding blew up, the wedding dress from the first marrage to our friend showed up on a scare crow with a pentagram on the front, what looked like blood (paint) on it in her front yard. 
No one even missed the wedding dress from the first wedding until then. 

Every woek place, everytime she dated someone seriously, etc the fliers showed back up. She finally gained about 50-70 pounds and quit trying to date seriously (she looked like her 70 pound overweight mother but 30 years earlier). She married a fat truck driver eventually...

RIP Big Bob, you were one hell of a friend and we are all going to miss you. We will sing the song of your people and raise a glass to you every time we meet!",2023,0.99,124,JeepHammer,2024-01-26 03:52:30,1abet85,2147,High
NuclearRevenge,Devastated teen snapped,"So this isn't MY story, but its something that I still kinda turn over a lot in my head whenever I think about it, and it's been several years.

(TW for Animal Cruelty)

So backstory: My very first year in college, I'm at a party, and get to talking with an acquaintance/classmate of a friend. I was and still am a pretty personable guy and so people tend to feel comfortable opening up around me even if they don't know me well. And that's exactly what happened here. We were both decently intoxicated, but this girl was definitely more drunk than I was. For whatever reason, we got on the topic of wild/stupid things we did when we were younger. She then proceeded to tell me this story. I remember it so vividly. Her wording wasn't the most coherent, due to her state, so much of this is paraphrase.

So, a few years prior, when she was in her mid-late teens, she had a cat. This cat was her best friend, had helped her through some very dark times in her personal life, you get the picture. Well one day, her cat unfortunately gets out, runs across the neighbor's dog as they're (presumably) out for a walk, dog snaps and mauls the cat to death. The dog apparently was known for displaying aggressive behaviors but had never actually bitten anyone, and the owner was extremely defensive of it and pretty much blamed the girl because ""that's what happens when you have an outdoor cat"", or whatever. The girl is, understandably, completely devastated and distraught, family either wouldn't, or couldn't afford to take any sort of legal action at the time, so... She decided to take matters into her own hands.

The exact details were kinda hazy but. From what I could gather, she apparently blended together a bunch of ground meat with some sort of weed killer, stuffed it inside a hen carcass for good measure, waited until it was dark, and threw the whole thing over the neighbor's backyard fence. Short time later the owner is pounding on the door to her house screaming that their dog was dead and they knew it was her that did it. She vehemently denied it, and I guess because she was both a minor at the time and there was technically no way they could prove it was her, nothing ever ended up coming of it, and she never told anyone in the neighborhood or in her family about what she had done.

I was in complete shock when she wrapped up. Left the party not long afterwards for unrelated reasons, and only saw her briefly a handful of times after that before I moved campuses. So I never really got any more info on it out of her, don't know if she even remembers telling me the story. I have very conflicted feelings about it. Knowing what I know about herbicide poisoning, that dog almost definitely did not die a peaceful death, and the lack of even the barest shred of remorse in her voice was chilling. I'm about as pro-revenge as you can get and I can't say I Haven't had some pretty fucked up revenge plans in the past, but God damn. Very glad I never knew her well enough to get on her bad side.

NuclearRevenge,My abusive mother gets a karmic responce,"It took two days to destroy the life of my abusive mother. 
We had a long strory, of course. I cut my contacts with her six years ago and just disappeared. I got in contact with my niece (let's call here Eva, 18 yo) a while ago, my mother (Hope, 63 yo) became her caregiver some time after I left. Now Eva lives with me and my husband. 

Eva chose to help her grandmother (my mother) financially even after she moved away from her. I didn't get involved with it. As I've told, it's her choice. Eva has left her cashcard to Hope under one simple condition: Hope should notify her if she is going to put or withdraw cash from her card. Hope was free to buy anything she needed with the card, the only thing she has to do is notifying whether she wanted to use the card in other financial operations.  Eva was regularly putting money on the card, she've also payed Hope's rent for a year in advance, because  my mother cannot afford rent and could turned homeless without help. My mother have fucked me up when I was young and trying to help her, so I refused to get involved with it, and my siblings refused too because of her behavior. 

Hope was abusing Eva's help for a while with not notifying her, and Eva knew about it. She wasn't okay with it, of course, but let it slip until yesterday. It turned out that Hope gave Eva's card to the third person for a free use, including putting and withdrawing cash. Eva wrote her asking wtf and why is she using her card this way without asking. 

Hope used her best strategy. She blamed Eva for being an asshole, she said that she had no choice. One of the things Hope have said to her that if Eva really mean to help her, then she should shut up and do it without words AND conditions and that Eva doesn't have a right to complain. She've also said that Eva is free to betray her and leave as me and my siblings did after we used her (including one of my older brothers who hadn't even lived with with her from the age of eleven, and Hope never did a thing for him since). 

We've had a long conversation with Eva after that. I once again explained that all of this is not Eva's fault and that my mother was always been like that. I wasn't even surprised for the answer Eva has got. I've got similar answers when I was younger. Hope didn't change at all. 

Next day Eva told Hope that she is still waiting apologies. She told Hope a ton of things about violation of their agreement, about her manipulations, about her not listening and not caring for people who was trying their best to support her which is why they are leaving her all the time. She pointed out that the current problem is that Hope is crossing all the boundaries set and that not knowing about what is happening with her bank card can put Eva in serious trouble, ESPECIALLY the giving the card away. I've seen screenshots and after reading all of that I believe that Eva tried her best to explain Hope her position.

All that Hope said was ""I understood. You are blaming me for being a terrible person and I don't want to fight, go away, live your life, feel free to not care about me anymore. I will better be homeless than be treated like that"". 

Now Eva had blocked her card and neither Hope nor the third person cannot use it. Eva will also not pay for rent anymore so in July Hope will need to find a place to live in. Eva also called all the relatives who had supported my mother. They are shocked and will never help her anymore as the things Hope told them was completely different but apparently Hope was like that from the young age. They didn't know how Hope had  been treating her children and grandchildren, and they thought that in her 50s Hope have finally settled down and matured. They gave Eva their full support and they adviced her to run away, cut Hope off and never cross with her again. They are going to stay in touch with Hope as she is their sister, but they will never believe her again. 
They have also asked about me. I lived with them when I was a child and I never called them since I turned 18 which is a different story and I am the only person to blame. I love them but I also didn't want to harm them and I actually never believed they would trust me as Hope did insane things to me and my siblings which they didn't know about. I've got their numberfrom Eva and I'm going to call them this Saturday and talk it's all through. Hope have befriended some of my school teachers I was close when I was a teen, and I'm going to find their phones and talk to them too. I do not know if this will work but also I don't want Hope to use them as no one from her family will support her anymore. I'm in rage for all the things she told to Eva.

So in two days Hope have lost her family and her house (not now, but in the future for sure). I will also try to make her to lose her friends so she would have no one to turn to in need. And tou know what? She deserved it for years of abuse. It took me a long time for figuring out what can I do, but we will make her completely destroyed for all that she've done. I'm not sorry for that and I'm pretty sure right now that I'm doing the right thing. I don't want Eva to be as broken as I am.",509,0.94,34,bleidddrwg,2024-01-25 15:57:58,19fkz4d,543,High
NuclearRevenge,"Bogan is as Bogan does, My Smoking Neighbour won't quit it on my driveway","For r/NuclearRevenge, user: pygmy requested a full story

  
Caution: I don’t speak English, I SPEAK AUSTRALIAN, (bad words n stuff)

  
My closet quitting neighbour who smokes:  
My street is usually quiet, we mostly all own our houses except for the odd one in each street that is a rental, due to the area improving we don’t have the usual trouble that used to occur, but there are those moments that make things annoying and unpleasant, and the new renter directly across the road from me became one of those unpleasant things that needed to be weeded out.  
  
My house is on a slight decline, living on the low side of the street, so my driveway slopes down to my garage, and from the other side, if you sat down there your invisible to the prying eyes of the houses on the opposite side.  
  
So recently I started finding cigarette butts around where I place my bins, no biggie, I just started tossing them into it and pondered, who the fuck has been smoking here, few days go by and if I was not at work and on a day off cleaning in the garage, sometimes I would notice my neighbour from across the street pop up on the top end of my driveway then turn about, this struck me as a little “odd”, this kept up and I just kept putting the stray butts in the bin, but it annoyed me, why smoke here and flick them to the bin, its less than 2 meters from the bin.  
  
So I had a chat with the wife, had she noticed anyone doing this, despite the obvious disturbed look she gave me she had no clue, knew it wasn’t anyone here in my house, its now just the two of us and eight cats and two dogs, they lack opposable thumbs to operate a lighter, so option B set up a wireless camera, with motion detection, and installed the app on my phone, to alert me, this was possibly one of the better ideas for the day, (man flu that day).  
  
Upon looking at the most security cameras that were available, we settled on eufy, nice little buggers easy to set up, battery operated and last for ages, water proof to boot, so I hid that little fucker under the roof pointing at the gap in the shed door, and It had just enough room to peek at the driveway and bins, think corner of a square hole with a round peg in it, nice big gap to see through, it didn’t take long to find where the butts were coming from, the next bloody day he got caught, brazen as fuck, the asshat swaggers down my driveway, puts his arse in park on it and lights one up, less than 2 FUCKING METERS FROM THE BINS! He smokes that ciggy dry and flicks it at my bins and wonders back to his nest, That. Brazen. Fucking. Littering. Cuntbag. Had to do something but first I have to give him a chance.  
  
So the next roster day I had off, I synced it with his smoking habit, and I waited for the “ping” from the app, sure enough, there he was, on rinse and repeat mode, not wanting to risk startling him and have him scatter like the cockroach he was, I went out the back door, and round the side of the house and out towards the front, as I approached he had just finished up, flicked the butt at the bins and stood up, as he turned around to find me, the proverbial “deer in headlights” as he spotted me, does not quite cover it, what felt like an eternity after he just processed he got busted “what the fuck you want” escaped his lips, I just asked, “mate, if your going to do that, at least smother the butt and put it in the bin”, all this bogan trash could reply with was “ you don’t own this part of the strip, council does, and you can’t make me do shit”, thinking he has won the Olympic gold medal for being a cunt, he shoves past me, walks across the road and returns to his nest, no fucker, no medal for you, GAME FUCKING ON.  
  
So that camera, buy eufy, … it supports dumping events to a NAS Network Address Storage, files get time and date stamped, every time this prick went out to smoke, it secretly took his photo, smoking and flicking the butt at the bin, all I had to do was buy bulk ziplock bags and just dump the butts in them, and write the time and date on them, if they wanted evidence so be it, they can have it. this is what I did for a year, collect his butts, write the time and date on the bag and show it to the camera for authenticity, and leave, so many butts, I wanted this, he wanted this, who was I to deny him.  
  
365 days in a year, could I make it that far, the box was just about full of butts and bags, and its only day 345, its so close but the stench, I had to do it, so I boiled the kettle and made a thermos of coffee, if I have to get up during the reporting of this, its to pee, and I am not going to do the neckbeard bottle piss, … that’s just gross, so I sorted through the photos on the NAS drive, and started prepping for the reporting, report a tosser, brilliant website branding, used it a couple of times before, and it took a few minutes to make a post last time, so logged in and started, each one by one of 345, but it had to be done, one after one after one, the cycle repeated, 200 to go, 100 to go, 50 on the home stretch now, was that enough FUCK NO, the image of his Olympic gold medal had to be reduced to ashes, he was not going to get away with this, carpal tunnel be dammed, it had to be done, finally after the last 50, were done I felt euphoric, exhausted, and dammed proud of myself, so I went to crash in bed, … or so I thought.  
  
“PING”, … wtf, my phone just got an email, “PING” … again, “PING” … fuck me is a reddit post going viral, … “PING”, oh its an email, from report a tosser confirming the reports, … each one individually like I did, “PING” … is this automated or is some poor human… sorry whomever that was, the only casualty in this strike was meant to be my neighbour, “PING” FFS, coming from android that little DND switch on an iPhone is AWESOME!  
  
It took a few days but one day I got the hint something was going down, first he got a letter box stuffed with mail, that’s weird, the next day was some angry noises coming from the house, like real loud, it sounded like a huge blowup between him and his missus, thankfully someone who lived next to him called the police, that shut them up for a bit, and then the notice, WTF WHAT DID I DO, … oh, they are sending a request for the box of Butts, … ok, post them off and be done with it, the FINAL day, I thought I was having a stroke, this can’t be real, I have never seen him in a FUCKING SUIT?!? Oh, yeh, legal, they wanted the butts, he took the “go to court” option, now on the website it specified $250 for an individual per offence, but I had no clue to … well 345 offences, well let’s just say, he left for the day, … and did not return, but eventually a moving truck turned up, and out came the internals of the house, .. tv, fridge, sofa, bed, angry looking woman, crying kids, … ok I feel a little bad for them, but considering who spawned them, .. not so much an ounce of regret.  
  
Eventually I found out that he took a plea for community service and a whopping fine over jail time, upon which his wife left him, so does for better or worse not mean anything, but considering what she had it was probably for the better and any interaction I had with here was far better than then her goal medalist, but that was all I could gather, he’s having to burn the candle at both ends for the both the fine, community service and child support.  
  
God speed my rotten bogan, god speed and good riddance you cunt.

NuclearRevenge,UPDATE - Can't keep it in your pants? Have fun trying to live a normal life.,"For context, here's the link to the 1st part of my story: https://www.reddit.com/r/NuclearRevenge/s/CRO0QjZdL2

Soooo, something happened in the past weeks. Just before the Christmas holidays actually.

In the last paragraphs of my story, I stated that I'm still occasionally stalking Connor's social media, to see if he was trying to get back on his feet. Well, he did. He tried to get back on his feet.

As I was scrolling, I saw he said he is a shareholder of a ""brand-new fitness brand"" he works for. I found this odd, since I know he can't afford to move from his mother's house, and he failed his driver's license and can't afford to try again so he can't drive. In other words, he's stuck in the small city where our high school is, with thousands of people who know his name and face and are aware of what he has done. It's near impossible to find a job in these conditions, and I don't see what skills or qualifications he could use to get an online job.

By doing some digging, I found the infamous ""fitness brand"" and did a bit of searching on their website. I found out that not only he is not on the list of their shareholders, but what he actually got in... Is a pyramid scheme.

I pushed him in a corner so much, that I made him join a pyramid scheme in an desperate attempt to get out of the situation I put him in. He created a second social media account to sell their crap, and never got more than 5 likes on a post.

At first, before realising that this was a pyramid scheme, I was like ""Alright, you know the drill at this point"" and I was preparing myself to get him fired just like I did before. But now that I know what kind of business this is... I'll just leave him in his own mess. Not only I would be doing him a favour by pulling him out of there, but I don't even know if I could if I really wanted to. They seem shady enough to not care about having felons in their team.

(Here, only 3 types of crimes are considered felonies: Taking someone's life whether it's murder/terrorism/manslaughter/etc, rape, and printing fake money. Of course, aggravating circumstances apply. All other charges are considered at most misdemeanors, which doesn't mean they can't get you locked up for a few years.)

This might be the one and only time I'll ever be thankful for the existence of pyramid schemes. I don't even know what kind of damage they can potentially do to him, and for now I don't see how he could be a threat to anyone; from what I gathered on his social media accounts, it doesn't look like he's in contact with people at the same level as him. If that has to change, I'll warn them individually.

But for now, I finally don't have to worry about this problem for a while (that is, until he inevitably gets out of there). Finding this out truly lifted a weight off my shoulders, to the point that I had almost forgotten I had this information. It's... Liberating, I would say, to finally be at peace. It had not happened in a few years.

One thing doesn't change, though: Go to hell, Connor. And trust me when I tell you that you'll have to wait for me to die before even thinking about starting to have a normal life.",1006,0.96,46,xSamThingElse,2024-01-17 21:01:54,199ftst,1052,High
NuclearRevenge,What Happens When Neighborhood Punks Decide To Beat Up Veteran's Son,"Apologies for the length, I'll be sure to include a TLDR at the end. All names have been changed to protect the innocent. This is actually a story my Dad told me about one of his childhood friends, George, who recently passed away.

Dad and George grew up in a booming city in what's now known as the Rust Belt. You were pretty much guaranteed a job at the major car plant in town. You were pretty much guaranteed a job at the plant in town as soon as you got out of high school. George was one of those people, Dad wasn't. Dad accepted a scholarship to his dream school to study engineering. During the weekends and holidays, he'd come home and hang out with his buddies, including George.

One afternoon, Dad gets a phone call from Grandma. George had been jumped after work and had the metaphorical tar beaten out of him. For a while, it looked like he wasn't going to make it. By some miracle, George pulled through but was in such bad shape that he had to retire early and go on disability. While on one of his visits home, George's dad, Walter, pulls Dad aside and asks him if he knows a guy named Flynn. Dad had heard the name was one of the local troublemakers. He asked Walter why and Walter revealed that the wallet had been found by George's body and given to him (the paramedics thought the wallet was George's, no I have no idea why they didn't check on it).

Unfortunately, the city was going through financial difficulties (thanks to corruption and mismanagement) to the point that they didn't have enough money to pay their police officers during the weekends. No, I am not kidding, from 8PM Friday night to 6AM Monday morning, there wasn't a single police officer on duty. Since the assault took place on Friday night, there wasn't much anyone can do.

Dad asked Walter what he was going to do about it. Walter looked at him with a stern face and said ""I take care of my own.""

Walter was an Army vet who had served during WWII and Korea. He never spoke about his time, claiming he was a radio technician and never left the base. He never breathed a word to anyone, even George's mother (his wife). The full story never came out until after George's death when a letter Walter had written before his death was found in George's possessions.

After realizing that Flynn was one of the people who had destroyed George's life, Walter got in touch with his friends. He was a personable guy, you know the type, the kind who makes friends in five minutes. They all agreed that something had to be done.

And thus Operation George's Revenge was born.

Walter and his friends began...observation...of Flynn and would keep tabs on him. It took several weeks but eventually, Flynn and his buddies (Mack and Zeno) were overheard bragging about the attack. Knowing who to attack, they moved to the next steps. Walter's friends (some of whom worked in high places) decided to make some phone calls to their friends in the plant where all three worked. See, these friends were union (state was closed shop at the time) and, disgusted about what happened to George, they decided to make things difficult for them.

They'd remove vital tools for ""emergency maintenance"" at the last minute, put them in positions they weren't good in and rearranged the schedule so they got the worst shifts...to name a few. They also began a whispering campaign so everyone at the plant knew what had happened. In this city back then, who you knew and what everyone thought you've done was enough to make or break you.

The goal was to get them to quit...and after a year or so, all three had quit, frustrated with how they were being treated.

But Walter and his friends aren't done. Not by a long shot.

A few phone calls and anonymous letters later, Flynn, Mack and Zeno were unemployable in the district. Because they hadn't been fired, they weren't entitled to severance or anything. Soon their money ran out but they couldn't get out of town because everyone knew from the whispering campaign what they had done to George.

For the rest of their lives, Walter and his friends ""kept an eye"" on Flynn, Mack and Zeno. Just when it appeared that they had an out, the whisper/letter campaign would start again and they'd be denied an out. The three men ended up homeless and destitute alcoholics who couldn't even get state aid. And this is in a state that is known for its generous aid for those in bad straits.

Walter and his friends made a ""contingency plan"" to continue this until the three men were dead using the next generation. So those men would never forget what they did to George. Nobody was able to find out anything about Flynn, Mack and Zeno...but I wouldn't be surprised that they're still stuck and miserable.

TLDR: Dad's childhood buddy was jumped by three troublemakers. Childhood buddy's veteran father and his friends decide to make troublemakers' lives heck for the rest of their lives.",2001,0.97,81,AQuietBorderline,2023-12-09 16:34:36,18eoxgv,2082,High
NuclearRevenge,Fifth Cakeday of r/Nuclearrevenge,"Hello, Reddit. Today is the fifth cakeday of r/Nuclearrevenge. Five years ago since November 27, 2018, our glorious leaders brought forth on this site, a new subreddit, conceived in the comments of a long removed r/ProRevenge post, and dedicated to containing the messed up stories of what human vengeance can conjure. Now we, admittedly, experience a drought of content, but tradition demands that we celebrate this day with a recap.

> Fourth Cakeday of r/Nuclearrevenge - November 27, 2022

This one is self-explanatory. The sun had existed for four years, and therefore had an annual post. There were few awards, and now that Reddit got rid of it, all that remains is the post to serve as a marker of the sub’s birthday and a couple hundred upvotes.

> Flashlight Story - December 21, 2022

If y’all misread the word flashlight, you may be disappointed by the story. Or not.

On this day, u/fitnessgrampacerbeam shared a [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/NuclearRevenge/s/n3IslWr9ob) where a fellow driver was being annoying with his headlights, so the OP fired back with a flashlight that had the force of the sun. The story is pretty entertaining and is the top post this year. Accordingly, it earned a place on this recap and the link is above.

> Bully Stories Announcement - December 24, 2022

On the day before Christmas, our head mod gave to us an announcement to quit sending stories that followed the format of a school bully getting their faces turned to pulp in a brutal, nuclear revenge. After a multitude of karma farmers showing up with the same stories and a bunch of post removals, however, they were more like dulled firecracker revenge.

> Voting for Story of the Year - January 8, 2023

A week in from the start of this year, a vote was held to determine the best story. Following the format set by the previous year, ten of the top stories of 2022 were placed for the users to choose. Three days later, the decision was rendered.

> Story of 2022 - January 11, 2023

Of 860 votes, 365 (42%) had been cast for u/Seneca_13 and this [tale of vengeance.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NuclearRevenge/s/gFDuzqtNjB) As the winner of the popular vote this year, Seneca’s story will have a place in this sub’s history. Congratulations.

> New Mods Join - February 26-28, 2023

Clay decided to ask for some extra mods to fill the void that was left by the others being removed. A bountiful amount of people applied, some jokes about obese mods were made, but in the end we managed to get two new mods. Say hello to u/_satantha_ and u/TotalBananas1.

> Discussion on the Blackout - June 6, 2023

Due to some threats to 3rd party apps by the Reddit admin, hundreds of subreddit decided to go private for three days from June 12 to June 14. It was almost natural for us to join the strike considering that the admins screwed over Clay years back. Therefore, he made an announcement beforehand to warn the subreddit that no activity would happen in a week for three days straight. And then…

> The Blackout - June 12-14, 2023

> Comment Announcement - August 28, 2023

Clay made a quick announcement to all users that comments on posts should be constructive and nice, not insulting or low effort.

> Fifth Cakeday of r/Nuclearevenge - November 27, 2023

As it says on the tin.

Now, as was added last year, here are some quick facts and statistics.

- 57,000 members have been gained as of the previous cakeday.
- 17 members were banned from the subreddit, 15 of them for spam.
- For reasons possibly related to the flashlight story, from the cakeday to February of this year, there was a steep rise in daily subs (200 a day).
- There was a spike in subscribers from August 10-24 where we gained 5,000 members.
- The daily rise in membership was averaged at about 150 a day. Again.
- The last post we got was on September 18, 2023. Oof.
- Story of the Year is no more. Double oof.

And that concludes the recap. We got a couple of fantastic and enjoyable stories, a single blackout, no cases of interesting drama, and another year of the subreddit’s existence. I’m glad you were along for the ride, and I hope you’ll be there for the next year.

NuclearRevenge,Never mess with my family,"My dad told me this story today over lunch and it seemed completely appropriate with this subreddit.  

There are two things to know before I tell this story. These events took place in the 1970s, in a third world country where justice is obtained with one's own hand and family, for better or worse, is unconditional.  
My maternal family, on my grandmother's side, is known in her town for having outbursts of anger, the kind that blurs vision and turns everything red, and a strong temper. No one in my family embodied these ""qualities"" more infamously than my great-grandmother, Mamadelia.  
Mamadelia was an implacable woman, violent with her words and her fists as well. With Mamadelia, my grandmother, her siblings, and later my father's generation, making a mistake, no matter how small, was a death sentence.  
Mamadelia was married to my great-grandfather (obviously), a magistrate of the supreme court of justice of my country and, according to my father, a good man and highly respected by all. But the moment that he walked through the door of the house, his authority ended and my great-grandmother's tyrannical rule began. Nothing was done or undone without her will and as you can imagine, my grandmother and her siblings resented her greatly. Mamadelia has been dead for 40 years now, but stories of her are still told at all family gatherings. They also say that everyone in my family, my grandmother (who if you knew her you would say I'm lying, she is a sweetheart) and her children, inherited her choleric gene that comes out from time to time in an explosive and memorable way.  

My great-grandparents had four sons, but only one is relevant in this story: José (not his real name). José was the second and the most rebellious of them all, the one who could not stand Mamadelia's mistreatment and he let her know it all the time. He was the only one who stood up to her and consequently the one who suffered the most. It was when José turned 15 that he decided never again to let himself be mistreated or abused by her. And of course, Mamadelia had something to say about it. I don't know exactly the details, but something my uncle did that upset her deeply. Years before, Mamadelia would have responded with leashes and screaming, but since my uncle was already 15, he was taller and stronger than her mother, she had to resort to an alternative tactic. She decided to call a policeman to the house. And what was her instructions to the policeman? To give my uncle the beating of his life. That was the last day my great-uncle lived at his parents' house. But where I come from, family is the most important thing, impossible to escape.  

Four years later, my great-grandparents had moved to their new house in another part of town. Next to them lived the Cordobes. The parents, normal people, but the son, Ruben, was another story. Ruben was about 25 years old. Ruben did not study, nor did he worked or helped with household chores (I don't this know for a fact, but I can imagine it). Ruben spent all his time and energy on two things: growing his muscle mass until he looked like an Andean Arnold Achwarzenegger and insulting my grandparents every time he saw them walking down the street. My dad couldn't tell me why, maybe Ruben was just like that or maybe Mamadelia said or did something to him at some point, I wouldn't be surprised either. What he did tell me was that Ruben's aggressiveness towards my great-grandparents was so extreme that he wouldn't even let them walk on his side of the sidewalk, claiming it was his. My great-grandparents never did anything about it (my great-grandfather had his first child at 46 and my grandmother at 36, so they were already old by then) and, for some mysterious reason, they never told anyone what was going on with Ruben either.  

This is where Jose comes in again. His relationship with his mother was strained and conflicted, which did not stop him from visiting them every so often to see his father and his three siblings. That day my great-grandparents were returning home and of course Ruben's shouts, insults and obscene rudeness were there to accompany them as they opened the door to their house. What he didn't count on was that Jose was arriving at the same moment and heard everything. The world went first black and then red. Like a worthy son of Mamadelia, José exploded.  
He lunged at Ruben three times. All three times, with a blow to the face, Ruben knocked him effortlessly to the ground. Faced with such a beast, anyone else would have abandoned the fight. Jose did not. Jose was used to the pain, the blood and the bruises that remained weeks later. Jose had lost his fear of confrontation years ago. Jose stood up one last time, under Ruben's insults and taunts, and charged him. I don't know how he did it, perhaps Ruben had let his guard down, but he managed to land a kick on his opponent's shin. Ruben did not fall to the ground completely but he was destabilized. Ruben did not know it but he had already lost.  
My great-uncle climbed on his back, as if riding a mad bull at a fair, grabbed him by the head and slammed him repeatedly against the pavement. The smashed face, the teeth scattered on the ground and the torrent of blood were not enough for José. What he did next was to grab Ruben by the hair and drag him up and down the street, twice, until my older great-uncle stopped him.  

The story ends with Ruben in the hospital, his face unrecognizable and deformed, and my uncle disappearing for a week to avoid any kind of retaliation. Never again did my great-grandparents have problems with Ruben, although José's relationship with Mamadelia never improved despite what happened.",1362,0.92,117,[deleted],2023-09-18 12:15:12,16m1br2,1479,High
NuclearRevenge,"I'm trained to be an asshole, you are not.","Removed from ProRevenge, told to post here:

This concluded about three months ago.  
First off let me say I have PTSD from two tours. This isn't a brag or flex, but any vet with PTSD will vouch that it is very hard to let assholes walk away.  
Because of this stupid shit I can only really work jobs alone now. I've been working awhile at cleaning stores after hours. (Not surface cleaning but checking areas that mice have been etc. Dirty job but the pay more than makes up for it.)  
One day I'm having some considerable back pain so my wife, MIL and SIL cover for me. I get a call a couple hours later from my wife complaining about the manager. Now, I've worked retail before and I know it sucks so I tend to give some leeway when non retail folks say someone's being mean vs. 'not in the mood for BS'. I hear he yelled at them when they walked in that the store was closed (Ok buddy, they used a key, chill.) Then he got upset that he didn't know there was a cleaning that day (BS, I wrote and distributed the schedule 3 weeks prior) Then tried to tell them where to clean (I have a contract, and your employees duties aren't included in it.) I rolled my eyes at the complaint, I admit it. Managers suck, and I didn't think this was a big deal, just some incompetent GM. Then I get a call a half hour later. GM was making some gender based jokes to his all male staff (Hey you puttin on your makeup, you need a tampon etc) while they were shutting down. OK, that's pretty tasteless but for me it's hearsay. Then I'm told that on his way out of the parking lot, they saw the GM TRY TO OPEN MY CARS DOOR. 

Insert PTSD here.

  
I call the store the next day, ask to talk to the manager on duty. I have a pretty civil convo, highlighting my concerns about the manager paying attention to his schedule and contracts. I mentioned there was some witnessed unprofessionalism but that's not for me to correct. Mind you, the convo is going very professionally up to this point. When I mention the car, guys whole attitude changes. He gets very vocal and very defensive, cutting me off and raising his voice. Before I realize, we are yelling at each other. I hang up and talk to my wife. I describe the guy based off of his voice and accent and my wife is certain that I'm speaking to the GM (I'll call him E)  
I call back and simply say ""I want to know what authority you had to try to get in my car."" E starts to play dumb until I name the security company that patrols and monitors his lot (shared lot with other businesses) and I can request footage through the police. E says he doesn't have to explain himself to me and he hangs up. Oh fuck no.  
I call back a final time. I say ""If we can't work this out I have to get your boss involved."" ""Fine, go ahead and call me when you do"" E hangs up.  


Insert Revenge. I wont go into HOW but I will explain what happened over the next few weeks. (Remember I have a key to this store and am still able to show up on contracted days)

  
\*E's handwritten statement about the argument goes missing. Not a huge loss, the thing was 90% lies to get ahead of what he did.

\*Find multiple disciplinary notes that all show that 'Mr. E' (as all of his employees seemed to call him) loved to write up all his employees for frivolous shit. This is a common tactic by weak managers as insurance for when employees complain about them. These also go missing.  
\*A file is found with many complaints about the store and interactions between E and customers. Copies are made.  
\*E's business starts to get multiple one star Google reviews from various accounts. Some of the reviewers post pictures of his stores mouse infestation and product damaged by little teeth that he leaves on the shelf. Let me tell you, seeing mouse shit next to food does wonders for your Google page.  
\*Two anonymous complaints to the city about the mouse infestation within the store, with pictures. (none of which match the ones I send to my bosses)  
\*One complaint to the city from 'an employee' that cites a ton of safety violations within the store. Then mentions how bad the mouse infestation has gotten and that the city should inspect and make sure they ask for proof of an exterminator (there is none.) Poor gal was begging. Her name even matched an employees name, fancy that.  
\*Random occult symbols begin to appear in E's work journal, hidden among things he has already written. (To clarify, this is because I could recall the symbols. It point wasn't for the occult it was so things would show up in his personal journal that he didn't write.)
\*His boss's boss (contact info hanging in office) received an email detailing his unprofessionalism, gender based harassment, and attempt to get into a vehicle that wasn't his. I also mentioned how many violations I saw as I was cleaning (broken equipment, safety hazards, lack of proper cleaning supplies, chemicals over pet food etc.) I even tried to compromise and said if they can provide a policy that says he could check my vehicle without security or law enforcement, then I'd retract my complaint. Otherwise, every scheduled cleaning that he is still there for, I'd cancel and send them a fee.

  
Suddenly, there is a shift in the store. I still go much later to avoid people, but it is much cleaner. There are even enough cleaning supplies for the store to function. There are less passive aggressive notes everywhere. Curious about it, I go in the office and see there is definitely a change. The complaint file is shrunk down and the office is cleaner. Whoever is boss now sure seems like a nice lady.

  
E receives a text from a number he won't be able to call back:  
""Have you learned your lesson yet, (his full name)? Or do I need to take your next job from you too?""  


The end.

  
Edit: This wasn't just some random guy that happened to piss me off. I read the other Google reviews and the office complaints. E was by far the biggest ass I've ever seen in management and further digging made it clear that he, a second manager (also responsible for a filthy store I clean) and their direct manager were buddies. Simply complaining would have resulted in nothing, clearly. Hence me going even higher. The other stores I clean (about a dozen other locations) are nowhere nearly as bad. Every shred of evidence uncovered showed that this dude just loved to abuse the shit out of his position. I have no ragrets gnomesayin?

Edit 2: since some people have vety low reading comprehension let me spell this out: you cannot act on words, watch any bodycam video. The cop explains to whoever assaults that words may hurt but you cant act on them. Once i had something concrete (footage of vehicle access) i had my golden ticket. any of you mad i didnt jump to my wifes defence over words are just as jevenielle as the manager. And when my wife told me, she wasnt crying or scared or anything, she was pissed and annoyed too. She knew i couldnt do anything about the comments, why cant some of you?

Edit 3: Having a PTSD episode does not mean I am suddenly ""back in the shit."" This is a common misconception. Not all PTSD manifests the same. What it means for me is I enter a mindset where the opponent is an enemy (Not a GM or shitty driver or rude passerby) and I have to efficiently and effectively destroy them in a way that keeps my hands clean.

Final Fucking Edit: This wasn't about the car. This was about what one man was comfortable doing to a stranger because he thought he could get away with it. The car was just evidence I could actually work with. For those pissed I didn't white knight my wife, she cared less about the words than some of you all did because she isn't a fucking child.",2759,0.97,211,seawolf88888,2023-09-01 22:15:20,167rg1u,2970,High
NuclearRevenge,"Drive over a kids bike, pay the price","Okay, this story took place a very long time ago, in the summer of 1969. I was about 12. I had an early morning paper route in my neighborhood. One of the first things that I bought with my earnings was a brand new ten speed bike. It was silver with red trim.  I was really proud of it, and I took very good care of it.  I also used it to deliver my newspapers in the morning.  

One of my customers was often leaving for work around the time that I got there. I always made a point of parking my bike well off to the side while I went up to deliver his paper. This particular morning, he turned too soon and too sharply while backing out of his driveway. and backed right over my bikes, ruining the front sprocket and derailleur. 

He stuck his head out the window and asked 

""Is it okay?"" 

""Not exactly."" I said

""Well, that's what you get for leaving it behind my car,"" 

Then he drove off.  I walked it home, crushed and upset. I felt helpless against this adult who clearly had no intention of doing anything about it, and I didn't know what to do. 

My hurt, frustration, and powerlessness gradually turned to anger. I stopped delivering his paper and when he complained. I told my supervisor that I was delivering, but he just liked to complain. So ultimately, it wasn't held against me. 

But the real revenge was yet to come. He lived on the main route through the neighborhood that all the kids took to go to the local 7-11 and other places. His mailbox sat on a steel fence post loosely set into the ground. That summer, I got in the habit of pulling it up and throwing it over the fence into the cemetery across the street, maybe once or twice a week. It was fun and mischievous, but it still didn't satisfy my need for revenge.

He had 3 large ""frond"" shrubs in his front yard that would grow to 6 or 8 feet over the course of the summer and then begin to die back. They were several feet apart, with nothing else close by. One August evening, I threw a lit match into one on my way home from the 7-11. I never heard anything else, but on my route the next morning, it was just a burnt husk in his front yard. Over the next couple weeks, I did the same to the other two. I was beginning to feel a bit satisfied .  

But one morning, on the way home from delivering papers, I had an inspiration. AI saw that the side window of his garage was open.  Now, I knew that what I was considering was taking it a bit far.  But I was an impulsive kid, and i thought tit for tat was fair.  Back in the day, everybody carried road flares (aka emergency flares) in their cars. So I climbed through the window, found 2 flares, lit them, and stuck one right under/behind each of his rear tires, then climbed out and high tailed it home and went back to bed. I did not go back to see what happened, and I stayed away from the area for several days. I knew that I'd ruined his tires. I never saw the result, but I didn't care.  And I never did another thing to him.

NuclearRevenge,I blew up a romance scammer’s life,"
This one is fresh and still unfolding but it’s already hit an explosive level. Some details intentionally vague.

Context: I’m a woman in my 30s with a reasonably good corporate type job in a field with lots of room for growth and am recently back into the dating scene after a decade. I’m kind of a “would be a 10 if she lost 30 lbs” looking girl, beautiful face if a bit chubby, but I never have issues getting a date lol. I’m not well off but I’m stable and have a bit of spending money. I live in a large multicultural city and my ex was an immigrant so I’m open to dating people of any origin. 
* if it wasn’t abundantly clear this bit about my appearance is a joke and only speaks to his failure to select an appropriate victim. I don’t care what people think about how I look 

What happened: 
A few weeks ago I met a very charming man from a Latin American country only a couple years younger than me. Seemed very sweet, cuddly, intelligent, family oriented, emotionally available, educated and in a good profession back home in his country and had a lot in common with me. Chemistry seemed amazing inside and outside the bedroom. 
He was honest that he was in my country on a tourist visa but hoping to stay. I made it clear I wouldn’t be able to help him with that but we’d have a fun summer fling while he was here. If he managed to stay or come back, only then would we consider a real relationship. 

Then the other shoe dropped. A couple weeks and 4 dates in, During a text conversation about my work, he asked me to be his sugar mommy. I initially laughed and assumed it was a joke. He kept pushing and clearly said it wasn’t. Of course, feeling insulted by this, I went off on him. He maintained it as a serious ask until I hit a nerve with my complaints about how embarrassed he should be to ask me that. Then he got angry and insulted me for thinking he was serious about it. No apology for being hurtful to me.

Obviously what I did next was take screenshots and cry about it to my closest friends.  I was hurt that I was fooled into thinking he liked me and that he thought I needed to pay for a man. My friends started the fuse on what happened next. 

One of my friends started snooping more on his online presence, together we found about 6 different Instagram accounts that were him using different variations of his name and different photos of himself all uploaded in batches. On Facebook, a similar pattern. All very scammy and suspicious looking. He’d been foolish enough on one of his profiles though to follow and tag the employer that he was working for illegally on his tourist visa in my country. 
So I contacted another close friend in a local law enforcement agency that works with immigration. She looked up his file, he had a wife and daughter at home! 

I released the hounds after that. The friend who helped me investigate online made several group chats on multiple platforms with all of his family (immediate and extended) and friends. She released all the screenshots as well as a rant about how shameful it was. As they started blocking her, she added more people. I found his sisters phone number, she sent her messages on there too. Everyone he knows including his wife know he’s unfaithful and trying to take advantage of women. 

30 mins after the online bombardment started I got a rude message from him about how I should be smart enough to know he was joking and he doesn’t need to sell himself. I didn’t reply. 

Next step? Online immigration reporting form with all the info we found; work info, employer name and address, his home address, full name, dob, photos, screenshots admitting to working. 
Usually these reports take months to be reviewed if at all but I gave the file number to my law enforcement friend.
Two days later, law enforcement officers visited him at home. They found him with a phone number that was issued to a local resident. All his roommates also had numbers issued to the same person, a direct link to the employer. 
He received a caution for trying to scam me,  a no contact order and a flag on his immigration file that based on his country of origin will likely mean he can never return as well as a strict warning to not work without authorisation. His roommates also received warnings. 
His employer received a visit next.  They found significant proof that they’d been employing him illegally as well as multiple other people. Their investigation is still ongoing but so far they are likely to receive tens of thousands in fines or possible jail time. The guy isn’t getting deported because the government would have to pay for it and proceedings take longer than his remaining visa time but he’s now upgraded from a flagged file to a multi year ban on reentry to my country. If he bothers me again though he will be deported as well. 

Hope he enjoys going back to his angry wife and the ridicule from everyone he knows. See ya again never!

NuclearRevenge,Ex Cheated with her cousin and expected to save face; I think not,"For context, it was her cousin-in-law.

Let's start this story by saying this happened 12 years ago. I'm now happily married with three children and regret absolutely nothing.

I was with my new ex for 3 years. I had noticed that she was being extremely controlling. I was expected to give every little detail of my day and tell her my schedule in advance, and if I deviated from that, she would be very upset. She chalked it up to just bad feelings she was having and shrugged it off as her paranoia for past relationships of infidelity. I had never once cheated or strayed, and I never gave her a reason to act like this. It felt unbecoming of my fiance to act in such a way.

Now this is where it gets juicy. After she had asked for my schedule to make plans, as mine tends to be more hectic than hers, I noticed she was texting someone. In my line of work, if I put in more than 40 hours, I have the ability to take time off at will as long as the work is completed at a later date. I was very good friends with a brother and still am. We laugh about this to this day, and he actively reminds her of it. I messaged him stating I wanted to do something special for her a little bit earlier than our anniversary to make sure it was a special surprise. They both worked in the same fabrication facility. He was a fabricator and she a shipping manager. He was kind enough to let me know her schedule. That's where the discrepancy falls into place. Without my knowledge, she was foregoing overtime; she worked 12-hour shifts Monday through Friday, with the exception of Wednesday, when she would only work half a day. She had been taking Wednesdays off right around the time that she started getting extremely controlling. Lucky for me, I had stacked several days of leisure time up, so taking a Wednesday off for me was not an issue. A few days go by, and Wednesday's here. I put on my work gear and ""leave"" for work. I was expecting her to leave as our apartment complex had two exits on the same road I could see directly across from a shopping center, so I parked my car near the back and waited.

After about an hour, I notice a very specific red Mustang with a specific decal on the back window. It was her cousin by marriage. I had also done my due diligence to take an old laptop, which we kept on our desk in an office area with a full view of the living room, bedroom door and bathroom plus the kitchen. I had set it up for remote access and had it alert me when the webcam noticed movement. Giving her the benefit of the doubt, I thought he may be dropping something off or coming over to assist her with something, as her family sometimes does. Sure enough, a message came through so I remote into my laptop. He walks through the door without skipping a beat, she unbuttons his shirt and begins kissing him. I created a URL link for the live stream. And as she was preoccupied, we had a family group text and a friend group text. They were both part of it, but at the current time, they were currently indisposed and didn't look at their phones. They didn't even wait; they could have gone to the bedroom, but no, they decided to get freaky deeky right there on the couch. I sent the link off to the friend group chat and the family group chat. Within minutes, I'm getting calls non-stop from friends and family alike. There was no turning back. She was getting blown up, but she was ignoring her phone. Not until the 4th or 5th call came through did they decide to take a break.

For context, the state I live in allows recording of personal property regardless of occupancy. I was the only one on the lease; she wasn't allowed to be on the lease because of poor credit.

The call she had picked up was from her cousins mother who she was banging. She answers the phone on speaker, and I kid you not, the first words out of his mother's mouth were stop fucking my son. They both became rigid, and she began to stutter over her words, saying, What are you talking about? etc. The mother then divulged that there was a live feed of them sent out by me to her family. She grabbed every pillow off the couch and covered herself up. The cousin staggered off, trying to put on his pants and shoes, just to trip himself up and bang his head off of my coffee table. Leaving it with a divot. By this time, I had made my way to the front of the apartment complex. I was there to greet the adulterer as he came out of the front exit. He froze and began to cry, apologizing profusely. I'm not going to lie; what happened afterwards wasn't my best moment, and I nearly got into legal trouble if it weren't for the fact that he was trespassing on private property. Let's just say I had a cast for 6 weeks, and he wasn't in any family photos for months.

I went up to the apartment, where she was now fully clothed and crying inconsolably. I asked her if it was snot or cum on her face. Then I told her not to answer because it didn't matter anyway. I gave her 1 hour to remove all her belongings, as again, everything in the apartment was mine except for clothes, some makeup, and a few kitchen utensils.

Her mother would not let her move in, as she was just filled with embarrassment. Same for her brothers, and the cousin's mother kicked her son out. Rumor spread around our town very quickly, and for a lack of better words, she was untouchable.

Edited: Supplying proof for the nay sayers. Eat your heart out.

I couldn't find my digital scan of the theft of property for my cat. My apologies

NuclearRevenge,Can't keep it in your pants? Have fun trying to live a normal life.,"A friend of mine told me my story belonged there so here we go.

TW: SA, rape, grooming.

In my country, high school starts at the age of 15 and lasts 3 years. I was a year early so I was 14.

During the first weeks of school, a guy in my class (for the sake of this story I'll call him Connor) approached me and we started getting along to the point we quickly started dating. Little did I know Connor would become my worst nightmare for the next 3 years.

He was 17 when we met and just like a lot of guys this age he was obsessed with ""doing it"". He pressured me into having my first time with him and he broke up with me right after I eventually gave in. After that, none of our next intercourses were consented, he was very manipulative and gaslit me into believing I wanted everything that was happening to me. It took me a while to understand what he was actually doing, in fact I only got it after hooking up with another person at the age of 17. Before it finally hit me, he had his way with me more than 50 times.

During our 2nd year of high school, he made the mistake of forcing himself violently on my best friend. She ended up getting an abortion because of him, and I started plotting my revenge. Originally it was supposed to avenge her, but it ended up working for me as well.

I noticed that not only he would only approach the 1st years even if he was 20 when I graduated, but he would also target the youngest girls among them too. He was repeating me how much more attractive I was at 14 than 17. So, knowing that it was pointless to tell the police because in my country only 0.4% of all complaints of rape where victims are less than 15 end up in a sentence, I ruined his reputation. I told every single one of his acquaintances that he was a rapist, and to protect my best friend I told everyone I was the one he had violated (which wasn't really a lie). The rumour spread like wildfire and after a few days even the teachers were looking at him with disgust. He was isolated, and the only reason why he wasn't bullied was because he is 6'3""/190cms tall.

I could've stopped there, but I didn't. When we were 3rd years, I knew exactly which universities he applied for. By snooping in Connor's bag I found his application numbers, so using those I contacted every single university he applied for and explained the situation, providing screenshots of his conversation with my best friend where he was threatening her with a defamation case if she attempted to press charges against him (she had sent them to me to rant about him and I had kept them all this time). All of them thanked me and he ended up not being able to get in any university. He had to repeat his 3rd year because of that, in an establishment where everyone knew what he had done and all the 1st years would know that they had to avoid him at all costs.

The next year, since I wasn't there to foil his applications, Connor was accepted in a university that I hadn't contacted the previous year. Unfortunately for him, I ended up learning which university he was going in and repeated the same process. There were former students of our high school in the university he was going to, who spoke up to the uni's mental health centre about the inappropriate behaviour he had with them and told them what kind of rumours there were against him. Since I had provided proof that the rumours were true, Connor was permanently expelled for the safety of the female students attending the university.

So now he doesn't have a degree and nowhere else to go study, with no social life. His situation couldn't get worse, could it? Well yes. I made it worse.

Connor tried to move to another region where no one would know him, and pass a diploma to work with kids. However, Connor is a phone addict, and couldn't help but share on his social medias that he had passed his diploma and started working as an educator for troubled kids and preteens. Little did he know, I had created an account pretending to be one of his only remaining high school acquaintances who I knew was chronically offline. With a bit of searching I ended up finding his workplace, and started the same process all over again. I also added a message he had left on my voicemail where he was panting while telling me how hot I was at the age of 14 and how he would have loved to go back in time just to fuck me again. Needless to say they got rid of him really quick fearing for the safety of the kids. I was planning on keeping reporting him to all the places he was planning to work to, but his previous workplace took care of that for me. I don't know how, but according to Connor's social media they managed to get him blacklisted on a national level, technically invalidating his diploma. Due to this he couldn't pay his rent anymore and ended up being homeless for a while before his mother accepted to take him back in. I'm friends with his older sister who knows everything about it, and told the rest of the family what happened. From what she's told me, everyone cut off ties with both Connor and his mother, including her.

I'm still occasionally stalking his social media to see if he's trying to get back on his feet. The last time I checked was today, right before writing all of this. So raping two people ended up isolating him both socially and from his family, as long as I'm alive he has no chance of ever getting a girlfriend, he lives in the region where he spent his high school years so no one would hire him even as a cleaner, and he even spent some nights in the street. Honestly at this point it's impressive that no one tried to harm him physically, make him go through what he made me and my best friend go through, or even end his life. Go to hell, Connor. And trust me when I tell you that you'll have to wait for me to die before even thinking about starting to have a normal life.",2860,0.99,142,xSamThingElse,2023-08-10 14:12:19,15nlfjr,3002,High
NuclearRevenge,Try getting me fired.. Enjoy homelessness.,"I was an adjunct professor at a college. One of the students didn't seem to take a liking to me and tried to get me fired by making false accusations that I had pinched and caressed her hair.

I did not take this lightly -- I could've been fired and faced criminal charges.

This student was on a scholarship that required her to pass all units by her second attempt -- our college also requires a minimum attendance to pass a unit. This was her second attempt at this unit as she had attempted and dropped out of another course before (which also had this particular unit in it's syllabus)

An eye for an eye right. I 'accidentally' forgot to mark her name down when taking attendance, even if she was there.

A few weeks later she was gone. I was confronted by her friend that she had lost her scholarship and was now living out of her car because of my carelessness in taking attendance.

NuclearRevenge,Abuse me as a child? Teenage me might ruin your life.,"I’ve wanted to tell this story for so long and I figured this was the perfect place. Apologise if the spelling & grammar aren’t amazing. I’ve written this out in one sitting and don’t have the energy to edit. 

When I was about 10 years old my dad got a new girlfriend: Lauren. Lauren was an evil monster. When I first met her she was lovely and friendly, I quickly liked her. But over the years everything went down hill fast. 

It started small; Lauren would steal my things then deny it, of course everyone believed her, she’d tell me that my dad loved her more than me and that if she wanted to she could click her fingers and he’d never see me again. She read my diary then told everyone what I’d written, she reported me to the RSCPA for abusing my animals (I wasn’t) After a couple of years she had my dad beating me (Yes I know he was an adult with choices and I hold him just as responsible) she would constantly tell my dad how bad I was and encourage him to hurt me, after a while he’d always snap and end up doing what she wanted. There are so many more things she did, but you get the picture. 

My dad & Lauren separated when I was about 16 years old, but they had a house together still. It was around this time as a suicidal, miserable teenager that I decided I’d get even; I spent months on my plan, and this is what I did:

I wanted Lauren’s entire life to fall apart all at once so everything had to be perfectly timed. I started by getting her fired and a minor criminal record: Lauren worked at a police warehouse for seized items, but naughty Lauren was stealing from the warehouse so I made notes on what she stole and when, once I had a decent enough list I anonymously contacted her boss with my list. Lauren was immediately suspended, after a few weeks she was found to be guilty of stealing. She was immediately fired and charged with theft including theft of a class C substance. 

Now Lauren was unemployed and pretty much unemployable. On to stage two: Lauren, with no income needed to sell the house as she was now unable to pay her mortgage. My dad also wanted to sell so he could move in with his new girlfriend. So I made the house unsellable (and pretty unpleasant to live in) My dad & Lauren were stupid and never locked their back door (I didn’t have keys) so I’d sneak in when I knew they were out and hide disgusting things: bugs everywhere, old prawns hidden under floorboards, I even stitched some old prawns into the bottom of the curtains. Dead mice everywhere, including under Lauren’s pillow. Live mice in the pantry. The house stank and no one could figure out why. Estate agents refused to list it or would only list it for far under the value and potential buyers would leave quickly after no one could explain the source of the vile smell. 

Lauren was approaching bankruptcy, exactly what I wanted. Only one area of her life left to destroy. Lauren had been in a relationship for a year or so with this guy. I can’t even remember the poor guys name. We’ll call him John. Well Lauren was cheating on John and with his own father of all people. Poor John proposed to Lauren, he needed to know who she really was. 

One day when Lauren had Johns dad over I got in the house via the unlocked back door I grabbed her mobile which she’d left in the kitchen (it took a few attempts and a lot of house watching to get lucky with the phone) I texted John from her phone pretending to be Lauren, I told him I was sick and asked him to come over, of course good old John rushed over, I unlocked the front door and text him letting him know to let himself in as I was in bed sick. I left and hid around the area. The drama was intense. Lauren & Johns dad half naked chasing after John in the street, screaming, crying. I think John might have even punched his dad before driving off. 

Obviously the relationship was over and John’s dad even ditched her in an attempt to get his son’s forgiveness.

So Lauren was alone, broke, unemployable, facing charges and about to be bankrupt.
 
Sadly I don’t know how the story ends. I cut contact with my dad around that time and thus my connection to Lauren was gone. I do remember my dad mentioning her being suicidal right before we stopped speaking so in my eyes my goal was achieved. I didn’t need to see the fallout anyway, just knowing what I’d achieved was more than enough for me.

And that’s the story of how I got revenge. Writing it out I realise how unreal it sounds, but that’s the whole story.",3876,0.97,219,Intox_Em,2023-08-06 14:08:46,15jxpte,4095,High
NuclearRevenge,Grandma’s Revenge,"Okay so disclaimer on mobile, writing in a rush, the story was relayed to me by grandparents so it may be embellished, yada yada let’s get to the story

I immediately have to write this down because it is the most amazing thing I have ever heard. I was visiting my grandma and grandpa to celebrate a bunch of summer birthdays together, but when I pulled up to their house, the plot to the right was completely empty. As in no stones, no base, no debris, just slightly overgrown grass. Grass; where there used to be a house.

When the hellos were said and the party started, I absolutely had to know what happened, so I went to ask my grandparents, and goodness gracious I was not expecting the rollercoaster of a story they told me.

A couple of years ago, my grandparents had some very unpleasant neighbors. Loud at all hours, trash in the yard, arguing with other people on the street, just absolute nuisances. It was a husband and wife, and their adult son who would come and go irregularly. The wife would get into arguments with anyone about anything, and the husband would physically intimidate the people who spoke up for themselves. They weren’t sure what exactly was the deal with the son, but it couldn’t have been anything good as it was well known he had been in the county jail more than a few times.
The house apparently reflected the tenants, as it looked awful. It was sagging and dilapidated, loose beams and peeling paint, but nothing was ever done about it due to the guy who rented out the place being a slumlord (we’ll get to him later)

It all came to a breaking point one night when my grandparents returned home to find their back door smashed in and some of my grandpas guitars missing. Now grandpa loves his music, and has been singing and playing his whole life, so it’s safe to say those guitars are not only very memorable to him, but damn expensive too. They of course went to the police, and after some digging they found that the guitars had been sold at a pawn shop or someplace by the son. They couldn’t get the guitars back unfortunately, but I believe my grandparents were fairly compensated since the guitars were insured (TIL guitars have insurance). Given how expensive the guitars were, the theft was absolutely a felony and the son once again ended up in jail.

After that, the neighbors would harass my grandparents through the fence or on their porch, meaning it was difficult for them to even sit outside. They would call them foul names, throw trash over the fence, and the husband would still try to get physical. Now while my grandpa is a very chill and mellow guy, my grandma will take shit from noone, especially not jerks like these. So what did she do? She got the house condemned.

It was easy for her to do, really. She called the local authorities (general attorney? property manager? I dunno) and they came and did an inspection, though it was clear by the outside of the house that it hadn’t been properly maintained for a long time. One call led to more calls, and the property was deemed unfit to live in, which forced the rude neighbors to move out. I’m not sure what happened to them or where they went, but supposedly they were put up in a nearby hotel by the slumlord until the house could be fixed…(ooo foreshadowing)

Now enter the slumlord. Of course his tenants told him who had reported the house, so of course he’s upset with my grandparents. Rather than fix the house though, he gets aggressive the first day he’s there, yelling at my grandparents about how they’re idiots for reporting him and how they’ve cost him a bunch of money and he’s gonna sue them and on and on. It gets to the point where the across the street neighbors called the local police to come diffuse the situation, which they do.

A few weeks pass and my grandma hasn’t seen the slumlord or anyone around to fix the house. Not being one to let things go easily, grandma starts making frequent calls to a bunch of services, reporting the house and its lack of progress. Each time, the slumlord’s truck would appear for a day, and then leave without changing a thing (grandpa said he would block in their driveway but since they stay home most of the time, it wasn’t a major issue. Grandma disagreed). Finally, my grandma had complained enough that officials came out and condemned the house for demolition. 

This had two major effects. First, the rude neighbors were now practically homeless, since as soon as they and the slumlord ran out of money to pay for the hotel, they’d be stranded. Second, the slumlord still had to pay a shitload of fines for the state of the house. The rest is more his fault than my grandma’s actions, but he would refuse to pay and refuse to show up in court, leading to a warrant being put out for his arrest.

A few months ago, the demolition teams came and tore down the place, leaving the lot perfectly baren. They even removed the driveway, so now it just looks like an extension of the side yard. My grandparents were not sure of the final state of the neighbors and slumlord, but my grandma looked very pleased with herself as she finished her story. I love her so much.",2984,0.99,63,Remote-Syllabub7412,2023-08-04 02:54:46,15htm0g,3047,High
NuclearRevenge,"I went no contact with my Narcissistic Mother over a Tea Kettle. She tried to ruin my life (again), so I ruined hers.","I'm 42, to say that I tried for too long is an understatement. I tried the hands off approach for my 30's and most of the time it worked. However as I've been learning about my co-dependency and trying to heal from the trauma that woman has wrought across my life, I've been much more upfront on calling her out on her bullcrap. I was patient. I wouldn't back down anymore, and I'd often find myself feeling absolute pleasure at seeing her flying off in an Narcissistic Rage over me being able to 'beat' her at her own game. Fun for awhile right? BUT, I realized these talks and texts we had were coming at a price to my mental well-being. Sometimes I admit, she'd get me, as a 'mom' she knew what buttons she could push to really get a rise out of me. I was trying to work on myself and started debating if No Contact would be the best choice. That's when it happened. The thing that sent me over the edge was a old tea kettle.

BACKSTORY: I moved back to my hometown after my grandmother's health was starting to go downhill to take care of her. As she was a former Nursing home CNA, I always promised my Nanny I wouldn't ever let her waste away in one of those facilities. But with the move came drawbacks. My once flourishing career was gone, and I was starting over at a smaller facility with much less money. In my mind it was more than worth the price of being able to take care of my grandmother. However, I would have to move in with my grandmother in her home, and as I've said my mother is a narc. I wasn't crazy about this idea as I knew my grandmother only had a lifetime estate on the property. My mother would inherit and I knew it would be hell. Before that though, I got 4 more amazing years with the woman who actually loved me and supported me. Even through all the pain my mother inflicted upon me.

Cue to when my grandmother finally passed. My mom sweeps into the home and starts to lay down 'rules' and what I needed to do to stay in her 'home'. Keep in mind I had done all the upkeep to the house for the last 4 years. I paid for everything, and never asked her for one damn dime of money. I know there's always a price when you ask that woman for help. So instead of bowing down and paying her rent to live in the house she wasn't even going to use I made plans. I informed her noo.. that won't be happening and let her know of my plans to move. To say she tried every which way she could to prevent my moving is an understatement. From trying to drum up new things I owed her money for, to dangling the carrot of signing the house into my name, to letting other family members know if they helped me move she'd never forgive them. I was 39.. that's how controlling this woman tried to be. However, I just kept my nose down, packed all my things, moved absolutely everything I owned by myself, and took off in a U-haul not even a month later.

After my Grandmother had passed, I did try harder in an effort to keep a relationship with my mother. I should have known better, but I told myself. One. More. Time. If she can't play nice then I'm going to cut this out of my life for good. It didn't take but 5 months for me to be completely done. Since moving my aunt made a group chat for us and my mother. Mostly to keep up with our day to day lives. Funny memes, just checking up on me and just wanting to know how my new home was. My mother would always say condescending things about my new place. But I would let it slide and remind her that I would've have been more than happy to live in her home had she not tried to pull what she pulled. That only made her say that I was ungrateful for her not having charged me rent for the years that I lived there taking care of her mother and working full time. Keep in mind, my mother remarried a doctor and took every penny of inheritance my grandfather left me. To say she's rather well off is no exaggeration. She's just that greedy. But back to my story. 5 months in my mother starts texting the group chat that I took off with items of hers from the house. Upon asking what it was I supposedly took she launched into a tirade of me never being able to tell the truth and that she'd never forgive me for what I had done. Again... having to push for actual details was hard over a text so I called. This is where the tea kettle finally comes into play.

THE CALL: So I called. She starts launching into me about how I gave an old cast iron tea kettle to my father, her ex husband. I'm like.. what the hell are you even talking about? She explains what she believes. That I had ,while living with my grandmother or after my grandmother died, given my father a old tea kettle from our wood stove. I let her know there hadn't been a tea kettle on that stove in years and I wasn't aware it was even missing. She had somehow found out that the tea kettle was back at my fathers place. Now.. if you have a narc in your life, you know how they absolutely adore to twist history to their liking. This tea kettle was in my father's family for generations. I grew up knowing this. My mother simply took it with her in the divorce to hurt my father as family heirlooms meant a lot to him. So I kept explaining over and over again. I had no idea what she was talking about or how dad even got the tea kettle. After screeching at me for awhile, I finally told her that I wasn't entertaining this notion of hers. I would call my father myself to figure out what had happened. She said I better fucking get the tea kettle back or there'd be hell to pay.

THE TRUTH: So, called my good old dad. Now my father isn't perfect. He's been pretty damn good to me. Especially after all the shit my mother put him and I through together. From using me to emotionally blackmail him, and intentionally sabotaging our relationship where ever she could. AKA, he knows she's a covert narcissist because he was married to her. So when I call him he answers with ""Hi is this about the tea kettle?"" I laugh and say bingo. He then explains while my grandmother was alive she felt bad that my mother had taken the tea kettle from him during the divorce and left it at her home. (My grandmother's house) After I moved back in my father started to come visit us. He always loved my Nanny, and she adored him as a son in law. They reconnected and he helped us a lot while she was still alive. He'd even visit when I wasn't at home sometimes. He said he noticed the tea kettle but never said anything about it to her until she brought it up one day. She told him to please take it back. She knew it was his and she didn't think my mom even remembered having took it. As she took almost everything from his house when they divorced. He was very grateful of course and took back the family tea kettle. Fast forward to years later when my father was talking to a buddy about their divorces and he was admitting that he finally got something back from her even if it took almost 20 years. They had a laugh but the friends now ex girlfriend was charmed by my mother and told her about the tea kettle being with my father.

BOOM! She she called him and started calling him a thief and that he knew that tea kettle was her family's and had never been his. He just called her on her bullshit and said well hell even if it didn't say my family name on it, possession is 9/10's of the law blah blah... and on no uncertain terms let her know that she would NOT be getting it back as it was his in the first place. She was LIVID and of course he was amused as she asked how the hell he got it in the first place. He explained my grandmother having gave it to him. But for some reason she fixated on it being my fault. I HAD to have been the one to give it back to him. I was the one who gave HER family's tea kettle to her ex. TIRING STORY ISN'T IT? No un-necessary and draining. Thinking that, was when I realized I was done.

THE EMANCIPATION: So having got the full story from my father I was texting to my aunt and mother in our group chat and telling them. My mother continued to call me a dirty liar and nasty comments in the group chat, in front of my aunt. Now I am the most patient and understanding person. So while I really hate how my mother treated me, I would never call her out in front of anyone. I would always argue and debate behind closed doors and alone. As I didn't want to #1 bring anyone else into the mess that was her abuse and #2 She was still my mother and I didn't want to embarrass her in front of anyone. I don't know what it was about this tea kettle that finally broke me, but it was the catalyst. But there were other things that made the tea kettle incident explode.

While I had moved, my mother was still intent on having me move back into her home so I could 'take care of it until I inherit it from her one day'. Ha.. yeah right. So I tested her on this a few weeks before the tea kettle incident. If I wanted to move back her conditions were that I would only have access to 1 bedroom. (there's 3, but she and her husband are hoarders. Btw his touch in this was allowing me to have access to the communal areas of the house. Isn't that so kind to allow me 1 bathroom and access to the kitchen and living room? They're a match made in hell.) The reason I'd only have access to one bedroom was they miraculously put their home on the market and it was going to be sold. They were going to move from a 3 story mansion to a 3 bedroom cabin. So that's the reason she couldn't put the house in my name right away. It'd have to wait until they bought a new house. They would live in the cabin with me while the new home was being built, and their old home sold. It's beyond insane, but this is how her mind works. I then told her no thanks. I'm very happy spending way more money being in a thriving city and having my own home with 3 bedrooms.

However... it struck me. My mother likes to lie.. a lot. So much so that over the course of years I was doing the hands off approach, I would record what she'd say and replay it to myself to remind me that I wasn't insane. Because as I'm sure many of you know gaslighting is a helluva drug. This house lie was another provable story. There would be evidence if it was on the market. One of my buddies who grew up with me is a real estate agent. He hates my mother because of how my mother treated his mom. So he gladly helped me me look at all the listings from as far back as a year ago. Supposedly she had put her house up for sale about a month ago. He couldn't find ANYTHING about it. It's listed as not for sale anywhere, even as of today's writing. So.. BOOM more concrete evidence of her lying. I had recorded the conversation with her and her husband without her knowing it. (Don't worry I live in a one party state.) Because again, nothing comes without terms and conditions and she likes to rewrite history. Back to the future. I had recorded this conversation. I thought it's about time that I do something different. If I'm thinking about going no contact I might as well go out in a blazing ball of righteous hellfire, right?

While she was attempting to humiliate me in front of my aunt again, I spoke to my aunt in a separate message. ""I'm sorry if you are going to be upset with me, but this has been 41 years in the making and I'm done."" She called me worried and I told her the truth. Finally I let someone else hear the lies she told me. And in the group text I posted the real estate listings and how their home was not listed for sale anywhere. My mother started to go into panic mode and was telling more lies about how it's not up yet because it was so new. I let her know that was a lie too, as it had been quite some time since she said she listed it. My aunt gasped seeing her floundering for an explanation in the chat. I explained and she let me know. No matter what she'd still love me and understood how after years of abuse I had finally had enough.

THE FALLOUT: So as a narc usually does, she went on her rampage and started to blacken my name to everyone in our family and in our hometown. Not a big deal, I don't really like my hometown. The few people I keep up with are life long pals. They know the private monster my mother can be, versus the public persona most people get. But for years it had been building. I had a lot of proof. However I was trying to allow her to behave and back off. I had not answered her since the night I posted those listings to my aunt's group chat. But I was getting nasty messages from the flying monkeys about what a terrible daughter I am. I finally texted and let her know. Unless she backed down and stopped this campaign against me, I was going to do something to her for how she's poisoning my name and reputation. I knew from reading about narcissists that this was coming so I prepared. When she didn't stop, and a preacher I had never spoken to contacted me via facebook to attempt to shame me into talking to her. I saw red.

I did it.. I went full scorched earth. I made a huge group chat, with all of my contacts in my phone, all our family, some of her friends, some of her ex friends, her husbands family, his kids, many people in our community, the preacher who decided I was a horrible daughter, many who believed her lies. Most of these people had turned their backs on me anyways. So I didn't feel too bad when I sent them all the nasty things she had said about them to me in texts, voice mails, and the phone recordings I had. I didn't realize how much I had saved. All just to keep my own sanity with her gaslighting me. And I sent it all. At the end of it, with the story about the house being for sale, and the latest lie fest she had concocted shown, my father who was also in the group chat took a picture of the kettle. He asked in the chat, ""Was this really worth it?"" Many of these people had also wronged him in the community due to the lies my mother spread about him after their divorce. He and I then left the group chat.

THE CONCLUSION: Suffice to say, that ruffled many feathers of people. Many of them were upset at how my mother had spoken about them. A lot of them blamed me for being a horrible daughter, and some have apologized to me. I don't care about them. I care about the damage I finally inflicted on the woman who hurt me over and over again with no conscience. I landed a blow to the weakest part of herself. Her public persona, her ego took that hit and now she can truly be the victim she's always claimed to be. All of this could have been avoided if she didn't lose her god damn mind over a old rusty tea kettle that's worth nothing. Nothing but sentimental value, and not even to her. That tea kettle was just a conquest to her. A token of victory over her ex husband. I went no contact that day. I have also cut off many of the relationships from the people in that chat even if they apologized. It's not that I don't forgive them, I just don't miss them. Maybe I'm a horrible person for doing what I did. But I can't lie and say it didn't feel good to finally show people what she's really like. I spent so much of my life trying to be the good daughter. That when I finally broke, I broke hard. I hope you don't judge me too harshly for my actions, but if I had to over again...I'd pick the same every time.

TL;DR

Mother tried to blame me for giving a tea kettle back to my dad she had stolen. When she kept calling me a liar I showed years of evidence of her trash talking and lying about our family and friends to them in a group conference. Went no contact and haven't spoken to her since.

Much thanks to u/cheturo & u/Sasha739 for the suggestion of posting in this subreddit. I appreciate ya'lls kind words and encouragement.

EDIT: Thanks for making me aware of the run on sentence. I admit I wrote this in a very emotional state and didn't edit clearly. I hope it's clearer to read now, even if it's a book.

UPDATE 1: I had some people asking for a picture of the Kettle so here you go: [Tea Kettle from Hell](https://imgur.com/a/FYZLDDH)

UPDATE 2: I have learned (it's been about a month since I posted this) that my mother contacted my father and tried to play the 'I miss our daughter card'. He informed her that I want nothing to do with her.  And yes, before asked he did have her blocked, she called from a friends phone. She keeps blaming my wanting nothing to do with her with me being 'brainwashed' by him and my support group. He promptly hung up, and if she calls back on different numbers he immediately hangs up. I have changed my number since the fallout, so she can't contact me personally. 

More people reached out about a week ago. Some family to let me know they broke contact with her as well over what happened. Her credibility is shot. Apparently she's miserable and everyone knows it. I honestly don't want updates on her. I steer conversations away when she's involved or mentioned. This is going to be my last update. I really do appreciate all the thought provoking and encouraging comments. They made me laugh, some made me cry, but all words were appreciated.

NuclearRevenge,Mess with my kids? Lose your house,"I've (M50) got two step sons, who I just call my sons as I've been in their life since they 8 and 10 and are now young men. My wife and I made it a point to have a great realationship with their dad (Jason) and made sure he had a chance to be around as much as possible, even staying at our place frequently to be around his boys as he lived over an hour away and couldn't afford to live closer.  


Jason had a crazy ex-gf who had tried to claim they were married (variously saying common law or that they were married in secret, or married on an Indian reservation), but he had a restraining order out aginst her because she was nuts and had tried various ways to screw up his life.  


The ex is a horrible person. She had been arrested several times for forgery and fraud. She and Jason had a fiery relationship, but he had it in his head that he should make it work as he did like her daughters and grandson. But the ex got him sent to prison for violating his probation when he left the county to go to his mom's funeral and hadn't filed an appropriate form (I'm a little unclear on this part, but she played a major role in it). After he got out several months later, she wanted him back and he wasn't having it. He made a clean break, moved to a new town, but she continued to harass him, thus leading to the restraining order. She would send texts to people pretending to be police investigating, saying he was drunk driving or taking drugs, or pretending to be friends/family to spread rumors and hurt him. She even sent texts to my kids from burner phones, pretending to be other family or friends, saying awful things about their dad.  


Jason died unexpectedly of a heart attack and it was a shock to all of us. He was finally living in peace, had great relationships with friends and his sons, and was the happiest he had ever been. He didn't have much. He lived in a single wide trailer a friend had let him stayin for free, some boxes of tools, old comics, video games, D&D books and modules, mementos from his times in the Marines, and an old (2009) pickup, which, on several occasions, he had promised my oldest son (let's call him Paul).    


Jason didn't have a will, and my wife became the executor of the estate because at the time of death, both the sons were minors and sole heirs. We packed up the things out of Jason's trailer and took the truck, which had Jason's name on the title but had to wait for the death certificate to retitle it in Paul's name. But the ex called Jason's sister demanding the truck saying it was hers and posting on FB she was reporting it as stolen, etc., which really pissed me off.   


After we got the death certificate, we went to the DMV and found out that she had stolen the title to the truck by forgery saying she was the only heir and we couldn't transfer the title.  My son was driving around with a packet documenting everything in case he was pulled over for driving a stolen vehicle. We had to get a lawyer and start a special process that took several months before a director at the DMV fixed it and we were able to title the truck with the ex continuing to threaten and cause problems and made everyone miserable and cost us several thousand in legal fees.   


Early last year, we got through probate court, the ex never showed, in spite of saying that she was the wife and sole heir.  The court declared the boys as the sole heirs and my wife as executor of the estate in their names. Instead of showing up, the ex sent an email to the court saying she couldn't make it because of work (she doesn't have a job) and that Jason was never around his kids (he didn't miss a single HS football game home or away and never missed a home track meet) and that they were just leeching off his SSI for the back child support.  She went on with a bunch of other non-relevant shit just to trash my wife and sons and pretty much said it didn't matter what the judge said that she should get everything.  


During this time we found out that Jason's name was on the deed of the ex's house. In order to get a reduction in property taxes because of Jason's disabled veteran status, she had filed papers to put him on the deed, but not the mortgage. If she had just left my kids alone, we would have let it go, but she had pushed principal beyond the point of denial, so we filed suit for half the house (property is worth about $380K). We went to court ordered mediation, and she rejected a mediated settlement of a fraction of the value, which we would have taken.  


In April, her lawyer dropped her and so she got a continuance on the first hearing. She then claimed that she had ""found"" a will from Jason designating her as sole heir, in addition to another signed paper that she ""found"" as a quitclaim deed from Jason for the house (I did wonder if it was this or her not paying him which caused him to drop her). She was going to go back to probate court to ""reopen"" (appeal?) probate and needed time for that, which the judge granted.  


On Tuesday, finally went to court on the deed to the house. She no-showed. The judge had inquiries to the probate court, and she never filed any papers. The trial lasted less than 10 minutes as the judge recorded the facts and awarded the estate half the property.  They will empanel three lawyers to determine how the property will be sold and she's going to lose her house and for the first time in her miserable life, face the consequences of her actions.

NuclearRevenge,Subreddit Blackout Discussion,"As most of us are aware now, many subreddits are participating in the June 12-14 blackout to protest the admins's actions against 3rd party apps.

We gave this decision some thought and discussion between our mod team first before jumping on the train. I'm not entirely sure how effective this blackout will be. But then again, I have a personal issue with the admins. Years ago they surprise banned me with no explanation which really hurt NR since a lot of enjoyable and informational posts were removed instantly. 

So I have no problem with holding them accountable for their actions. And despite our mod team not having any need to use the 3rd party apps, we all agreed to participate in this protest as it's very unfair for the mods that do use them. 

Those apps provide tools that can make moderating and the overall user experience much better. And ultimately, this appears to be a greedy, infringing, power move. 

Even though this event may be popular, we would still appreciate that you continue to spread this message. Thanks!

NuclearRevenge,Knock down a grade II listed building without permission? Have the council planners office deny all your applications for the next 99 years.,"I lived in a large village as a child. The village contained 4 shops, a post office, 2 pubs, a church, a primary school and a really old grade II listed school. The Victorian school had been used as a library when I was a small child, but then was bought by a local business owner. 

Anyone who lives in the U.K. knows there are very strict rules regarding what you can do with a grade II building. Number one rule is you can’t do anything with it without planning permission. But this businessman thought he was above the law and knocked the school down one day without consent. 

The council gave him a huge fine at the time, but that was only the start. 

I audited the planning office last year and came across the file one this plot of land. In the past 40 years, the owner has submitted 11 plans to build on the land and has been denied every time. There is a note outlining the first offence and legal documents reminding planners that no building will be permitted on the land for the next 99 years. The owner knows this but keeps trying. There are notes on many failed legal actions taken. 

There is also a caveat that if the land is sold, all new applications will also be denied to the new owners. 

I also saw a recent request for the owner to repair the fencing and clean up the site as it was an health and safety issue and he will be fined if he doesn’t comply. 

So the owner is now left with a plot of land he can’t build on and he can’t sell it because nobody in our area wants land you can’t build on. 

I also noticed that the same businessman was building houses in the same borough and the counsel came out and made him move the footings of all 12 houses because they were not quite in the position agreed by the counsel planners. It must have cost him thousands. 

The moral of the story is people may not have long memories, but local government does.",2912,0.99,104,Sea_Supermarket_9728,2023-05-18 18:07:55,13ldwmz,3016,High
NuclearRevenge,"Guy tries to sell house from under my family, gets his just deserts.","On mobile and this is a story from when I was a kid so apologies for formatting/ not having complete details. 


   My family was looking for a large house and found the perfect one back in the early 2000s. When my dad talked with the owners they had agreed to getting some plumbing fixed on the house before we moved in if we moved all of their stuff into the 2 car garage so it'd be easier for them to move. Their was also several things to be repaired, a pool to clean and a ton of landscaping to be done. My dad did the repairs and used his army of offspring to do all the landscaping, pool work etc. The house was looking amazing compared to before and we were a week from moving in.


   Now, I to this day do not know why my dad did this.... but he had paid a CASH DEPOSIT. There was no paper trail and the owners decided to take advantage of this. When it got to be a few days before we moved in the owners told my dad they weren't moving their stuff out of the garage or doing the plumbing fixes that were needed to use any of the bathtubs or showers in the house. He could deal with no garage and pay for the plumbing fixes or he could fuck off. No refund of deposit if he didn't like it. They even said they were thinking of moving someone else in bc the house value was more with all the fixes we  had already done. 

 My father asked to turn in the keys we had been given the next morning bc this was all told to him at 8pm on a weekday. With no paperwork yet signed, there was nothing attaching my dad to the house and no cameras or security system. He had just been fucked over a few thousand dollars by the owner and it was maybe 2 weeks to Christmas. His gift that year was going to be giving each if us kids our own rooms for the first time. 

  Cue revenge. He brought all of us kids over to the house for a little party. Each kid was given their own special bit of destruction. Someone was shoveling sand into the pool, my brother with anger issues was told to punch out ever hole we had patched up in the walls, the smaller kids were told to rock the banister on the stairs until it broke, I was told to rip out the landscaping we had done out and make a path of it all over the stairs. Every single thing we had fixed or improved taken back by very creative and energetic children.  While all this happened my dad and step mom went through everything in the garage from the owners and took anything they could gift to family, pawn ,or sale. There were high value collectibles, jewelry, and a computer that my dad gave to us for Xmas.

  The next day my dad told the owners he had put the keys in the garage with its door open that night for them. He then unplugged the phone and we never heard from those people again. Was it legal? No, not on either end. Did we have a good Xmas? Yes. Was it fun destroying the place? Yes, I actually did a very tastefully done carpet of hedge branches, torn our flowers and some or of sand and pool gravel.... on the actual carpet of the house.

I did post this elsewhere before but it got taken down for violating a rule. I am the op for that post as well as this post.",4619,0.98,143,britty-bird,2023-05-10 19:25:00,13e8259,4762,High
NuclearRevenge,"My ex fiance refused to respect my boundaries, so I married his best friend","Tl;Dr: ex fiance ""forgot"" he cheated on me and free loads, so I marry his best friend. 

Back in 2019, I had just moved my long term partner into my house due to a series of poor life choices on his end. It had been a rocky relationship for most of its duration, but I was young and dumb. I believed this was him wanting to commit and truly start our lives.

By early 2020, we were engaged. I was a full time university student, sole caretaker for my mentally disabled mother, and taking care of the house and our pets. He worked a standard 40 hour a week, minimum wage job and refused to help with any aspect of life. I found out on Christmas day 2020 he had been unfaithful and had ""forgotten to tell me"". He was planning on leaving me but had informed everyone except for me because he was failing to secure a new residence (apparently his fuck buddy didn't like him enough to let him move in). 

At this point it was very little love lost and I expected he would be moving out within the coming weeks. Fast forward three entire months and his ""search"" for a living place was nonexistent and he was acting more and more entitled. Clearly by this point, he is an unwelcomed free loader who has taken up residence in my living room.

I was about to secure an eviction notice to get him off my couch. He began swiping tinder with his phone volume loudly on. I told him to not do that in my presence as it was highly insensitive to do in my home and he could do it in private. This continued, so I told him I would sleep with one of his friends. It was said in a moment of anger and was more of an empty threat at the time.

However, I am known for seeing goals to their completion. I messaged the guy who was supposedly my ex's best friend and the best man for the wedding. It turns out he didn't even consider my ex a close friend and my ex had acted similarly terrible to this guy previously as well. We bonded over our terrible experience, hit it off really well in general, and started dating. I was up front about what the catalyst for me to reach out to him was. After 2 years of dating we were married April 2nd. He watched me graduate with that bachelor's degree my ex disliked, I'm half way through my masters, and my husband works in a specialized steady field that supports us. Last I heard my ex got kicked out of his dad's house, never was able to officially date his side chick, and has not made any choices to better his life.",5533,0.96,111,UltimateOatie,2023-04-18 17:51:09,12r7lbd,5644,High
NuclearRevenge,Don’t kill your neighbor’s dogs,"My crazy, antisocial, elderly aunt lives in the mountains of West Virginia. My aunt is a mean, bitter old woman, who was suspected of shooting and killing her ex-husband, but the cops could never pin it on her. 

Years ago, she bought a small home on some land  that borders the land of another family in a small, narrow, isolated, forested mountain valley. The other family had been living there for a long time, and they just wanted to be left alone, like most people who chose to live in a remote mountain location in West Virginia.

My aunt bought chickens and started to let them run around, unfenced on her property, and the neighbors dogs were very interested in those chickens. The chickens would roam around, and go over onto the neighbor’s property.

One day, without warning she killed her neighbor’s dogs for killing one of her chickens, and only one of the dogs was killed on her property. The other one was shot dead in the neighbor’s front yard. 

The neighbor’s had small kids and they loved those dogs. My aunt walked over with a shotgun and told the neighbors that they had better never get another chicken killing dog(s) again or else she would kill them too. The neighbors didn’t take to kindly to her killing their dogs, and her actions with the shotgun, waiving it around and threatening them was over the top. 

But they didn’t call the cops, knowing that my crazy aunt, who had a reputation for being violent, was unlikely to be arrested, and if she was arrested, she would just quickly be released from jail and be back. 

So a couple weeks later when my aunt went into town, her home’s back window was broken, and a bottle of burning oil and gas was thrown into her home. By the time the fire department finally arrived, the home was a complete loss, and every dog and possibly ex-husband killing shotgun and firearm my aunt owned, along with all her other worldly possessions were incinerated. The home was a total loss, along with the chicken coop etc. 

The neighbors didn’t see nothing and the sheriff’s department couldn’t prove anything; my aunt had a long list of enemies. She didn’t work and so was too poor and lazy to have home owner insurance. So she had to move, and her son eventually bought her a cheap, run down trailer in town.

Those of us who knew my aunt, figured she got what she deserved. Morale of the story, don’t screw with a mountain man’s dog.",4264,0.98,197,OdinTheAmerican,2023-04-17 09:15:56,12phppk,4461,High
NuclearRevenge,Town forced to bull doze new development after building on land they don't own,"Hi Reddit, I've got one gem of a story that my grandfather told me about his hometown after he came home from WWII. It has to do with a tree framer, a corrupt mayor, and over 20 homes getting bulldozed. Enjoy!

At the end of WWII, thousands of troops were heading home, starting new families, and wanted to move out of the city. There was a major housing boom all around the county, people couldn't move out of the cities fast enough, and developers could not build home fast enough. There was a ton of money to be made in the construction business. Which led to some ""underhanded"" building practices. One such practice was starting construction before the land acquisition was finalized.

Enter my grandfather ""G"". After serving as a pilot during the war, he came home to a very different town. When my G went off to fight in 1942, the town that he described leaving was ""tired and worn down"". But to his amazement, the town he saw stepping off the train in 1948 was anything but. Newly paved roads, a traffic light, and new homes. New homes that just went on and on. He actually got lost on his way back to the family farm due to the new main town road being re-routed while he was away. But what took him by surprise the most was the new development being built on his childhood friend ""John's"" tree farm.

This was surprising to him, mainly because he knew how much the farm meant to John and his family. The farm went back at least two generations. But my G just guessed that the developer made John's family an offer too good to refuse. However, that thought was shot down later that evening during his welcome home dinner back home. It was my great-grandmother who tipped him off that something was off. He couldn't recall exactly what she said, but it was something along the lines of ""Oh, I just wish John was still alive to be here"". My G nearly choked, not because of the news. But because John was not dead! He was still in Hawaii! My G had gotten a postcard from him not but four days before.

Turns out while John was off in the Navy fighting in the Pacific Theater. John's dad had suffered a stroke and passed away, and his mother passed away less than a week later from a ""broken heart"". More than likely, John was never informed of their passing. And now 20+ homes were being built on their land. My G about ran out of the house, jumped in his father's Model T, and raced down into town to send one bombshell of a telegraph to John in Hawaii.

John Your Folks Passed.

Farm Now Being Built On

Come Quick - G

My G never got a response back. He figures that John must have fainted from shock, then jumped up and ran to the Navy base to get on the first boat home. Because he was back home in less than four days, and he was MAD! According to my G, when he burst through the doors of the mayor's office, everyone in the room looked like they were about to drop dead. The poor desk clerk was fumbling over his words, trying to talk to John. Then, the mayor came out of his office to see what all the commotion was about. As soon as he saw John, he went white as a sheet, then ran back into his office and locked the door. Getting nowhere at the mayor's office, John went to the next town over and hired a lawyer.

What followed was a seven-year court case that ended in the mayor being sentenced to eight years in jail and the developer going bankrupt. Turns out that after John's parents passed away, John wasn't able to be contacted for some reason, and was just assumed ""dead"". So when an out-of-state developer wanted to build homes in the area, the mayor just permitted them to start building on John's farm ""for a hefty kick back"", of course. Also, because of Johns's lawsuit, the developer couldn't finish the pre-sold homes. Which ended up in more lawsuits.

In the end, the mayor and the developer and the town ended up having to pay John close to $45,000.00 total, which is over $752,000,00 today. And then the farm had to be returned to its prior condition. To say John was happy would be a vast understatement.

Today, John's Tree Farm is a nature reserve, and the story of the corrupted mayor is all but forgotten except for by a few locals. John passed away in 1999. My G has been back to his hometown a few times to visit his grave and to check on the old tree farm.

NuclearRevenge,Fire me for speaking up? Enjoy going out of business.,"Initially posted this in r/pettyrevenge , was told it would also be good story to tell in this sub.


This is a long one, skip to the bottom for the TL;DR if you must.

Edit: Forgot a few words and sentences on the initial post

Many years ago, I worked at an automotive repair shop that was owned by a very nasty person. This person actually had 2 shops that he ran, and the best way I can describe him was as a tyrant. 

Both shops had cameras, and he would watch us work from the comfort of his home. If he saw something he didn’t like, such as taking a 5 minute smoke break, or not sweeping for half a minute during down time, or if he just wanted to bust balls, he would call the shop and harass us. Or better yet, at times, show up and harass us in person.
In addition, he would regularly berate us for no reason, threaten to not pay us because the shops weren’t busy, and would have an absolute meltdown if you dared question his authority. It was spectacular, in the worst of ways.


After working for him for a few months, and dealing with his shenanigans, and getting sick of pointless arguments with him, I started reconsidering my employment there. Around the same time, the owner decided to move me from one shop to the other, really for no reason other than likely to try push me out, as that was what he did with the few people that I had already worked with. Odd coincidence being that I had not discussed my thoughts of leaving with anyone, but I digress.

I genuinely disliked the idea of working at this other shop. It was older and a bit run down, plus it was in a pretty terrible area with high crime. But, I wanted to line something up elsewhere before I jumped ship. So I made the move. This is where the beginning of the end started for ol Mr. Owner.

Once I got settled into the new shop, I got to talking with my fellow technicians. As it turns out, the owner was unsurprisingly a racist scumbag, and every single one of the employees at this location, aside from me, was African American. I’ll spare you the details but let’s just say it’s a miracle that the owner came into the shop, said what he said, and walked out breathing. In addition, he would regularly send people home with no pay for the day just to be an ass.

This went on for a few weeks, him coming by, being nasty to all of us, and I was over it, and was just about to leave as I had lined up other employment. The other techs were also over it.

I went to give the owner my 2 week notice via phone, discreetly, which I should have known wasn’t a great idea, and instead of discussing it like a human, he decided to come down and talk face to face. Well, our friend was so incensed that I put my notice in that he forced me to clock out and go home, and also forced 2 other techs who decided to stand up for me to do the same.

I decided that I had enough of this guys shit, and that not only did he deserve to have some kind of reciprocation against him, but the other techs deserved better than to continually being walked on.

So I filed a complaint with the department of labor, and outlined everything. Within a few days they had launched an investigation, and of course the owner found out who filed the complaint and called the shop, and gave me hell about it, stupidly, because the phones he had were on recorded lines. Guess who I had request to listen to that conversation?

In the end, I was terminated by him prior to my 2 weeks being up, as were the 2 techs who stood behind me. I filed for unemployment, which he fought me on by filing appeals with a judge, then not showing up 3 times in a row. This prompted the judge to bar him from requesting appeals against me, and granting me full unemployment pay.

Months later I got a written letter from him extending an apology and offer to work for him again. 2 months later, I got a letter from the DOL saying that the investigation was closed, and that he had been found guilty of multiple charges and was barred from operating a shop or any other business in the state for several years.

TL;DR fucked around with my sanity, lost the ability to own shit.",4287,0.98,70,lolwhatmufflers,2023-03-26 19:39:59,1235jdl,4357,High
NuclearRevenge,Ex-boyfriend violates me and denies it. I ruin his life.,"Trigger warning for sexual misconduct. It is minimized where possible while keeping the story cohesive. Double heads up, this is a LONG post. TL;DR at the end.

At the beginning of these events I am about to share, I was 20 years old (now 21). I was involved in a five month relationship with my ex-boyfriend, JackassEx, (also was 20, now 21) who attends the same school as me. We started dating in December, and I broke up with him in May. At the time, I was taking a gap semester from school for previous unrelated reasons to the events being told here, and was instead working full time.

We went into this relationship both as each other’s firsts. We were also subsequently part of leadership in a student-run group, with both of us being elected shortly before I broke up with him. This is a story of what happened in this relationship, as well as afterwards, that subsequently resulted in me ruining his life.

I toyed with keeping this story to myself, but the closure from my experience includes getting it off my chest, and maybe some internet strangers can help me feel a little better about everything that happened.

I won’t go overly specific to try and spare my identity, hence the throwaway account, but anyone who knows of the fallout probably knows who I am. To those, I stand by my actions.

And if my ex is reading this: You deserve so much worse than what you got. You are subhuman scum.

Parts I-III provide context and a backstory that were abbreviated to get the gist across. Part IV/V is where the revenge starts.

I – The Start

I did not know JackassEx at first before we started seeing each other. A mutual friend, Bestie, introduced the two of us because we shared similar interests; we hit it off and went on a few dates over the span of a few weeks.

One night, JackassEx came to my place, we watched a movie, and cuddled through the night. This was what I’d consider the official start of the relationship. We were seeing each other pretty much daily, even when he went home to visit his family (I lived within reasonable driving distance). The relationship moved in a way I’d consider relatively quick in hindsight. He also gaslit the words “I love you” out of me two weeks in by misshaping words I spoke into the phrase.

JackassEx also mentioned shortly after we started dating that he had a previous ex in high school who was closeted, but the details I have are relatively faint (they were all disclosed by him). He mentioned that this relationship abruptly ended when the high school ex accused him of rape, telling his friends, his high school admin, and his family. This reportedly drove my ex to therapy and ruined his social life. My ex swore up and down that he would never do such a thing to anyone but wanted to be upfront with me at the beginning (though we were pretty much exclusive at the time he disclosed this). I, obviously taken aback by this, didn’t think that he was capable of something like that, and told him as such, and comforted him for sharing such a vulnerable experience with me. I largely forgot about this afterward though.

II – The Relationship

When I first started dating JackassEx, we discussed our preferences, what we were looking for, the standard relationship spiel. He told me that he was looking for someone masculine, and I told him I wanted the same. We both assured each other we were masculine figures, but only one of us was telling the truth, which I’d come to find out during the relationship (he was honestly quite femme-presenting). He would say things even before we started dating that, in retrospect, seem somewhat off-putting or outright manipulative without raising red flags at the time. Again, this behavior became habitual throughout the relationship.

Shortly after I started dating him, I joined a student-run design group that JackassEx was a prominent figure of. I had been exploring joining this group or one similar to it, but dating him at the time gave me the confidence to move forward with it. I didn’t play a huge role in it initially, as I was working full time, but I began making acquaintances with those in the group, as I was generally regarded to be a friendly face.

JackassEx had acquaintances in this group that he would make comments about that were vile and sexual in nature. One of them was a mutual acquaintance to the both of us, and the things he would say made me question whether JackassEx was aware that we were in a monogamous relationship. These comments seemed to be attempts to invoke jealousy to me, but I never gave in. However, they only perpetuated the red flags he was giving off.

III – My Own Doubts, The Break, and the Breakup

I would argue my doubts began sometime around month three. Some of the doubts that I felt involved the deepest questioning of my sexuality in my lifetime, as well as whether I was truly attracted to JackassEx. I had a few people in my life that I had been attracted to for a while, and intruding thoughts of me being with them began to run through my head. The red flags JackassEx had displayed began to illuminate in my head, and slowly, these doubts I felt began to affect the relationship. I had never questioned my sexuality severely, as I kind of always knew that I was a gay man. I realized that I was starting to lose the spark I thought I had felt towards JackassEx when we first started dating.

He also started to become more aggressive in initiating/when I turned him down. One time, when I declined, JackassEx angrily looked at me and asked me if I was “sure that I was actually gay.” This question rubbed me the wrong way because I had long since shared my story with him about the discovery of my sexuality (I had known I was gay for nine years at the time, though I had only been out for two years). Needless to say, JackassEx slept alone that night.

I worked to mend my side of the relationship, though there were many challenges to overcome. The gap in compatibility was quickly growing evident between the two of us and started causing tension. I had mentally begun to exit the relationship, as I was beginning to feel guilty for not keeping him happy. JackassEx also was insistent I quit my full-time job so I could go back to school and properly focus on it, and the job had started to demand more from me (up to ten hours of overtime per week sometimes). I was steadfast on staying employed (I was a manager of a place I had worked at for five years), and this furthered the tension, as he felt I was choosing work over him.

Around the end of April, there were elections being held for leadership on the design team that JackassEx and I were now both a part of. They had an empty position for their treasury role, for which I had experience with my job, so I ran for the role and got it. He had been gunning for a project management role and was given it as well. This happened in conjunction with the relationship turning rocky but didn’t seem like it would be a problem. It is important to note that this design team was quite important to JackassEx, he put a lot of time into it (it was his main thing outside of school), and almost all his friends that he had were in it. I wanted to make sure that I could help this continue to thrive for him, so I kept trying to mend the relationship, though it was slowly wearing me down.

One morning in early May, as I was sleeping at JackassEx’s apartment, JackassEx attempted to make a move on me at 3:30 in the morning. I, asleep at the time because I had work at 7, told him that I didn’t want this, and turned back over and went back to sleep. This seemed to stop him, but only temporarily. I stirred again at about 5:30 because I felt something on me. JackassEx was now on top of me.

I tried to fall back asleep, but he continued, then proceeded to finish on top of me. I, disgusted, got out of bed, and showered to get ready for work. He did not say anything to me in this time frame, not even an apology. As I was about to leave his apartment, he stopped me and said that we should take a break. I tearfully agreed and left for work feeling like I had done something wrong.

The break was mentally relieving and challenging for me. I felt right being apart but didn’t feel right about everything that happened. I was still questioning my sexuality and was facing ever-increasing challenges with work (I was tasked with managing two departments at once and worked almost every day during the break). I didn’t talk to any of my friends about the break because I felt like I was the one that caused it.

A few days later, JackassEx called me because he “couldn’t stand not being with me” and wanted to be together again. I reluctantly eased back into it but had mentally known the break was the beginning of the end. At this point, he had moved back with his family about two hours away for an internship, so this post-break relationship was basically long-distance. We talked, I told him I was going through tough times with work (to try to justify my off behavior), and he began texting me sappy daily messages, to which I largely ignored because they felt shallow, and they only made me feel worse. I responded to some of them/would pick up his phone calls, but this was mostly an effort to show that I was still alive and somewhat engaged in the relationship.

On a Saturday morning, JackassEx called me super early and left a voicemail to the tune of an ultimatum, asking whether I was willing to make things work or if he “needed to move on.” This call was the final straw for me- I knew that this was when I needed to end it. I wrote a brief letter, called him back, and read it to him. I broke up with him over the phone (this was NOT my finest hour, but he left me no choice). He was entirely taken aback by me calling the relationship off and tried to ask me to make it work (manipulatively). I ended the relationship amicably because I thought I had done something wrong, and he agreed that we could remain friends (lol).

He called me early the next morning begging me to reconsider, and that we could work it out. The phone call woke me up this time, and I simply told him goodbye. I went to work that afternoon and had a mental breakdown. I felt guilty for the breakup and felt like everything that happened was my fault. I wound up putting my two weeks in at my job (I wound up staying and am still employed there, unbeknownst to him), and texted JackassEx that I had done so. He responded that he was happy for me, and that is the last direct communication I have from him.

IV – The Discovery

The summer was relatively refreshing for me. I began to work on improving myself, made some new friends, and cut back my work to a healthy amount, all while getting back to my school courseload. I didn’t talk to JackassEx at all during the remainder of summer. In fact, I didn’t even see him until late August after fall classes resumed, when he passed by me with a new guy, NewBoy. When I saw JackassEx walk by with NewBoy, he pretended to not see me, but I couldn’t hold back an ugly cackle. JackassEx clearly didn’t want anything to do with me, but the cackle was from seeing JackassEx with someone new, because the manipulative statement he had made when I dumped him became obvious. NewBoy was not exactly a good looking guy either, which only added insult to injury.

A few weeks later, I had a falling out with the elected president, Pres, of the design team. I was tasked to compile a part of a report that required others to do their part first. This report was due on a day that I had plans that could not be put off, and no one did their part until the last minute. Thus, I was unable to do my part, and another board member wound up doing it for me. I was transparent with my plans and why I couldn’t complete it on my own, and the board member apologized to me for stretching me thin like that. The president, however, was angered. She berated me and aggressively doubled down when I tried to justify why I couldn’t do my part. The exchange drove me to nearly rage quit the design team, but I held my head up and instead got to thinking about a path that took the high road. One thought led to another, and suddenly I was thinking about why my relationship with JackassEx failed (we are supposed to be in correspondence with one another, but he elected to not work with me, which was partly why I couldn’t do my task. I simply didn’t work with him either).

At the same time as the falling out with Pres, the design group had a photoshoot for all elected board members to receive headshot photos. I, not being close with any of the leadership, was mostly minding my own business. JackassEx, however, brought NewBoy along to try and show off in front of me (NewBoy was not in the design group). This quickly became evident when they began cuddling directly in front of me. This wound up being a bad call on JackassEx’s part, as it only made me consider further why our relationship had fallen apart.

In these thoughts, I thought back to that fateful May morning, and a terrifying realization came across me. The happenings of that morning were textbook sexual assault. In hindsight, I’m shocked I did not realize it sooner. I realized I was a victim, and it was hard to come to terms with it. I initially diffused it with humor in a weird coping strategy involving denial but told some of my closest friends of the discovery, so I didn’t feel alone. I also pondered how I should handle it moving forward. I also had never returned the two things he left in my apartment: his key, and a shirt that he really liked (one of his favorites). I threw the key away (he probably had his locks changed), and I wound up burning the shirt.

Then, the memory of what JackassEx said to me about his high school ex ran through my head, which I had initially forgotten. I had been put in a mental trap that JackassEx was not capable of sexual misconduct, and this is probably why I had mentally blocked the realization of me being sexual assaulted for so long. Given what I experienced, and based off what he said, I cannot say that JackassEx did not rape his high school ex, and this terrified me. I knew what I needed to do. I didn’t believe that approaching JackassEx was the best move, but I felt that I was under heightened pressure (since he started dating NewBoy) and he could potentially do it again.

V – The Reporting

Given that it took me over five months to discover the assault, pressing charges was out of the question. I needed some form of administrative documentation if I couldn’t press charges. And I wanted this by the book, because I was disgusted that I was so severely wronged. Fortunately, my school has a program for Title IX (Title9) that handles sexual misconduct. So, I called them up and filed a report. In this report, I outlined in detail the happenings of that May morning, and requested an informal resolution, where my report was documented but an amicable agreement was to be reached between JackassEx and I. There was a “formal” route that could result in academic repercussions, as it went in front of a student honor court, but given my lack of hard evidence, there was an extremely high chance of the case simply being thrown out like it never happened. The informal resolution still logged the incident, just in case anyone were to report him again down the line.

The advisor that worked on my case had to be impartial, but he was on my side the entire time and reassured me that I was handling it correctly. In this resolution, I requested that JackassEx stepped down from his role in the design group, apologized to me, disclosed the happenings to any current and future partners, considered going back to therapy, and be re-educated on the concept of consent.

I asked for him to step down as the lack of communication between us in the team was starting to impact my work in the group further, but I knew that it would also be a difficult decision for him to make. This was intentional, as I wanted the consequences of his actions to sting. The latter four requests were semi-filler but still had purpose, including covering my bases while staying by the book. The requested apology was so I could feel some form of closure by him at least acknowledging he did wrong, the disclosure of the happenings was borderline intended to be a homewrecker for his new relationship (but also, this is a reasonable thing to disclose to your partner), the therapy request was a low blow (since he claimed he had to go before) but a genuine ask, and the consent education was a dire plea, because if he can’t recognize that being asleep isn’t consent, I’m not sure what he considers it to be.

VI – The Interim & The Report’s End

In the midst of the report being filed and Title9 working on reaching out to JackassEx, the governing body at my school that manages student-run organizations deemed me ineligible to be the design group’s treasurer (their system is really backwards and their reasoning was stupid. I didn’t have enough credits to be considered eligible) They demanded a replacement treasurer. Pres, who suddenly was nice because she needed something from me again, held a meeting and asked me if I’d be okay still doing my job but just “marking” someone else down as the treasurer to satisfy the governing body. I agreed. JackassEx was in this meeting and quickly volunteered to put his name down with a smirk on his face. I, also smirking, simply said that was fine. Pres then moved to crack a joke- she started to say how “it was funny that JackassEx was taking my position since…“ She quickly stopped speaking, widened her eyes, and looked at myself, then JackassEx. Those few words told me that JackassEx had mentioned our relationship’s end (the entire elected board was friends with each other, excluding me), and it also demonstrated to me that they were talking poorly about me behind my back. I firmly believe the comment she was about to make was her finding it funny that JackassEx was taking my position because we had previously dated, but she stopped herself when she realized she was about to talk badly about me to my face. I smiled, feigned ignorance, and quietly dismissed myself from the meeting.

JackassEx, on the other hand, was not staying in touch with Title9. They reached him after about two months, and he initially admitted to the advisor that he did not disagree with the instances I described, but wanted me to know that he was “learning intimacy.” I politely told the advisor that I could understand to a point, as I was in the same boat as him, but that doesn’t excuse his actions. I also asked the advisor if he had decided on the resolution, to which he hadn’t. The advisor then attempted to call JackassEx back to get a decision from him on whether he would follow my requests, but JackassEx began dodging phone calls for about two weeks.

These two weeks were some of the hardest of my life. The ugliest parts of the relationship were playing through my head nonstop. I was drinking nearly nightly to ease my mind (not my proudest hour). I wrote a long, emotional letter regarding my thoughts that was subsequently emailed to Title9. I did this to document the feelings I had while further strengthening my case, which to people outside of myself, was relying on anecdotal evidence. I called Title9 back, expressed my concerns once again, and they thanked me for the letter because it provided additional perspective from my side. I requested that when they reached JackassEx, to give him this ultimatum: if he was stepping down. I also asked they let him know if he chose not to, that I would step down, but be “thorough in explaining why I stepped down.” I worded it intentionally because I had begun to plan my exit with the design group and was banking on JackassEx valuing his pride over accountability.

I was right. After those two weeks, JackassEx finally picked up and told Title9 that “Everything that happened was consensual, I am not stepping down, and that is all I have to say.” Title9 immediately called me with this news. I was simultaneously shocked and not surprised. Even the Title9 advisor was floored that JackassEx had doubled back on his previous statements. I asked if the previous words/admission would hold up if I were to press charges, but because Title9 is protected speech, it wouldn’t fly in court. I thanked the Title9 advisor for his help, knowing exactly what I needed to do. JackassEx had said the exact words needed for me to do my part (“all I have to say”).

VII – The Disclosure

The aforementioned call came to me at 3pm on a Friday, shortly after I got home from classes. Less than twenty minutes later, I was sitting in the office of the design group’s faculty advisor FacultyAdvisor. I told him what happened, and what I was planning to do, including my resignation. JackassEx’s misconduct had not only wrecked my mental state, but because I was outright afraid of being around him. I was hardly participating in the design group outside of my administrative duties after I discovered I had been assaulted by him. FacultyAdvisor was extremely sympathizing with what I described and directed me to hold a meeting with the elected board (including Pres) to announce my departure. He gave me otherwise free will to figuratively set off a bomb. I organized a meeting with the entire board for the following Monday sans JackassEx and alerted them that the meeting was important, all while keeping the operation under wraps from JackassEx.

Come the Monday meeting, I had created a fun PowerPoint presentation that created a quick slide show touching on all the topics mentioned above. The board arrived slightly tardy and were chattering amongst themselves until I launched the PowerPoint, with the words “Wake Up Call” displayed on the screen (I thought the title was clever).

I started by thanking them for showing on such a short notice. I announced my resignation, a background of our relationship, what JackassEx did to me, and what I did, including making the Title9 report and what is involved by doing that. The board sat there in silence, absolutely stunned at what I was presenting them. I further went on to delegate my treasury duties, offering to assist anyone that needed it aside from JackassEx. I slyly mentioned that JackassEx was definitively the one responsible for my duties, due to his quick volunteering before, and I looked at Pres directly when I said it. The look in her eye at that moment was sheer terror. That moment of his volunteering and her comment afterward flashed through her mind.

I paused for a moment to regain my composure (it was a hard presentation; I held back tears giving it), then continued with the presentation. I read the group’s governing documentation and pasted portions from it in the presentation. I outlined their impeachment process and recommended that they vote to remove JackassEx from his elected position. I tossed in the group’s zero tolerance policy on sexual harassment in the presentation for good measure. I reiterated that JackassEx had violated me while I was unconscious, and questioned how anyone could ever consider those acts consensual or humane.

Everyone else in the room was crying by the end of the presentation, which somewhat surprised me at the time (again, they were ALL friends with JackassEx but were not close with me). They thanked me for telling them what happened, told me they needed time to process everything, but that they would keep me updated on what they chose to do. The board also asked me if I would reconsider staying if he stepped down or was otherwise removed, to which I told them no. My justification was that my impact in the group was too deeply impacted by his behavior, and that staying around would only be keeping my wounds open. I left the meeting with a huge weight taken off my shoulders.

VIII – The Last Interaction with JackassEx

I walked back to my car after the meeting and texted a professional resignation message in the group’s communication channel, citing personal reasons and wishing the best for the group. This would be the first of the communications that JackassEx would receive related to the meeting that had just happened. I directed any treasury concerns to Pres while they worked to appoint a replacement. These communications were kept professional, as I intended to come out of the situation with grace (any malice could’ve disrupted my efforts to be credible). I then drove over to FacultyAdvisor’s office with the intent of catching him up on the meeting that happened.

I instead pulled into the parking lot to see JackassEx’s car parked outside. I thought to myself “oh great, he’s probably inside, this might be fun.” Coincidentally, Bestie was also stopping by the building, and I ran into her in the parking lot. I hadn’t seen her in a while, so we hugged and I told her that I had just stepped down from my position, and that I was doing pretty rough (my mind was still quite fogged from the meeting I had just left). I told Bestie that I wanted to talk, but right then wasn’t a good time, and invited her to talk later (she was entirely unaware of the happenings between JackassEx and I- she knew we broke up but not why). As I turned to move inside, I saw JackassEx sitting inside his car, and I realized exactly what just happened. From his perspective, he thought he had dodged the Title9 bullet, just saw me hug Bestie (our mutual friend) and had likely been reading the resignation message I had sent. Furthermore, I was going into the building where the design group runs out of (which was, not proudly, a relatively rare sight). To top it all off, his phone was also likely blowing up from the elected board calling/messaging him to figure out what was going on. FacultyAdvisor wasn’t in his office when I dropped by, so I messaged him an update of what happened, and sat inside for a minute to collect myself after everything that just happened. I then walked past his car to get back to mine, ignoring his presence, and I left. I couldn’t imagine what JackassEx was feeling at that moment, though it was likely some combination of terror and shock. It selfishly made me feel good.

IX – The Fallout

The following day, the rest of the elected board reached out to me mostly individually to express their sympathy and check in with me. I had kept what happened to about eight pertinent individuals in order to not paint the entire group in a bad light. I still wasn’t sure if the group was going to follow through with the request that I made to remove him, or if they even believed me.

Turns out they did. That evening, I received a notification from the elected board’s group chat, as well as the group’s general chat, with a message that tagged everyone from JackassEx stating that he was resigning immediately upon facing immediate removal. He NAME-DROPPED me in this message and stated that I had made “false allegations” that were investigated by the school and “dropped” (they were not dropped. Title9 doesn’t simply get dropped). He also claimed that he sought legal representation for the claims (none of what I did was illegal, so I call BS here), and stated that he was disappointed by his friends- he spun it as them choosing false claims over their friendship.

He then somehow sent this message as an email to every person who had ever been a part of the group at my school. 700+ people get this email with my name on it at 9:30pm at night, and my direct messages start going crazy. “Why did I get this?” “What is happening?! Are you okay?” “I don’t know what’s going on here, but he seems like he’s hiding something.” “What was alleged?” These were just some of the messages I got. I responded to most of them by simply stating that no one should have ever gotten that email, but to not worry about me.

But I was livid. FacultyAdvisor messaged me, he was livid. The entire elected board was livid and in shock that he sent that message.

I messaged FacultyAdvisor to meet the following morning so he could catch me up on the internal fallout I had missed. Turns out, the elected board immediately reached out to JackassEx and said that he needed to resign or face immediate removal. JackassEx threw a tantrum and sent out the message, which he felt vindicated himself from any wrongdoing. The message made the board even more convinced that they made the right decision, because they thought JackassEx was hiding something with the defensive tone he held in the email.

In this meeting, FacultyAdvisor confided in me that JackassEx was also banned from the lab space because of that email, which was extremely unprofessional and painted the entire group in a bad light (he name-dropped the group in the email as well). Because of the severity of the email and the now on-record events that had occurred between JackassEx and I, the dean of my school was also informed. FacultyAdvisor reassured me that I had handled the situation properly and commended me for taking the high road. I had not once spoken poorly about JackassEx to the elected board, nor did I drag the group through the mud, though I very much had the opportunity to do so (I made him aware of the conflict between Pres and I in this meeting).

I also spoke to Bestie that day, who also received that email, and told her everything that happened. She had remained friends with JackassEx after our breakup, and she told me that he said I had ghosted him (she had not previously asked for my side). Remember those sappy text messages he sent before he asked if he should move on? Yeah. My not responding to ALL of those (I had responded to some, and I had called him in between them as well) was what he framed as ghosting. So I cleared that air with her too. She was absolutely floored that he could do such a thing, but we reconciled over many questionable behaviors he had displayed throughout my relationship and, independently, her friendship with him.

X – Wrap Up

With these events, I would say that I received my closure, or, at least, as close to closure as one can get in this type of situation. I don’t think that JackassEx believes he’s done anything wrong in this situation, but honestly, I’m okay with that. I simply stated what happened, and it caused a daisy chain of reactions that culminated in JackassEx losing almost every single one of his friends (as the heavy majority are in the group and were made aware of what happened), his passion (the design group), and the space that he used to spend most of his free hours in (the group’s lab). He also lost FacultyAdvisor’s respect, who is a very prominent figure in our school, as well as JackassEx’s now former boss. The school is keeping an eye on him now, while also potentially considering disciplinary action on him. When I say that the group was important to JackassEx, I mean it. When he wasn’t in class, he was usually working in the group or spending time with the friends in it. I don’t know what he is doing now, and honestly, I don’t care. I don’t see him around anymore.

Remember NewBoy? Allegedly, JackassEx was still together with him at the time I gave the PowerPoint. To keep my stance of being professional through my actions, I am not going to dig around to find out if that was the case (I don’t know who the boyfriend is, and JackassEx does not have a social media presence). I could ask Bestie, but I believe that NewBoy received word of the incidences I brought forward. I suspect that JackassEx may be single as a result. Regarding the high school ex, I do not know who he is either, or if he even existed (this could’ve been a really screwed-up lie that JackassEx made). I made my decision to report JackassEx in the first place by going off the assumption that what JackassEx told me was the truth (that there were previous allegations made).

I gave him the opportunity to take accountability for his actions, but he instead chose his pride and ruined his life in the process. As I initially stated in the beginning, JackassEx deserves so much worse for what he did to me, and most of the karma he received was due to his own pride-sparing actions. I would’ve sent him to jail if I could’ve, but the evidence I held would not be strong enough to put him there. He may not presently believe that he has done anything wrong, but those closest to him know that he did, and to me, the social repercussions he faced seem like (almost) suitable punishment.

Thank you for reading.

TL;DR: Discovered my ex-boyfriend SA'd me after I broke up with him. I was in a complicated position as I still had to work in professional settings with him (despite him pretending I didn’t exist). I took the high road and went to town on exposing the truth, he chose a path of denial and inadvertently ruined his own life. Now, he has lost his passion project, his friends, the respect of his supervisors, and potentially his new relationship.

NuclearRevenge,"Revenge is a dish best served cold, mine has been cooling for 10 years and counting.","I(40F) have been married to my husband (44M) for 20 years now. We have 2 kids 16F and 13M. My husband is what I would consider a high earner by middle class standards. Also, strap in folks, this is going to be long. I've never told anyone, so...

Tldr: my husband cheated on me, I dragged the guilting for almost a decade, then ruined his life and chased him out of town.

10 years ago, and by complete coincidence, I found out that my husband has been cheating on me, with men, and that from before we got married.

We live in a small-ish town in the south of the USA, him coming out as gay will have consequences. I believe that that is the only reason he has not come out to anyone.

First, here's how I found out he was cheating on me: he got sloppy, left a credit card bill (for a secret card) in the pocket of a coat. While going through it I found all the telltale signs of infidelity: payments to a hotel in a nearby county, restaurant bills, gifts, flowers, condoms and lubricant...etc. I started camping outside the hotel on days he told me he would be late, and I saw him bringing different men there.

I am very good at compartmentalization an have a great poker face (comes with growing up in an abusive household), so I was able to give myself the time to cool off, and to come up with what I should do.

First thing I did was getting an STD panel, since I didn't know how safe he was with his partners. It came out negative. Then I convinced him that we should use condoms, since I was having side effects from the pill. He was ok with it.

I had a long think, and I came up to the decision that I was not going to confront him, nor was I going to leave him. He was able to provide me a really good lifestyle, one that I would never be able to afford with my highschool diploma (a cleaning lady, a nanny to help with the kids, regular spa days and a country club, a new car every other year, luxury family vacations every year...); he was a good dad, a good partner (the cheating aside), and really good in bed.

But I was not going to let him have a single guilt free week in his life. That would be my revenge.

I started small, planning great date nights for us, telling him that I felt our relationship has cooled, that I wanted the spark back. Then I would sometimes slip into conversation some *tea* about a cheating husband, a *gasp* gay man that has been using his poor wife as a beard, complimenting the only gay couple we know for having the courage of being real men, who were out and proud of themselves... On the other hand, I would praise him as the perfect husband to anyone and everyone, especially if he was in earshot. The amount of guilt gifts I got was astounding. The man was even sending me flowers weekly.

It continued the same way for years, I could literally see how much it was weighing on him. Me? Well, my parents were part of a commune with the concept of free love, I was the same. I just considered myself in an open marriage. It seems that cheating is easier to ignore if you are not that big on monogamy in the first place. And my husband was keeping me satisfied, so I felt no need to find a partner of my own.

Then four years ago, I guess he met the love of his life. He started seeing just the one guy. I was seriously thinking of ending the whole thing, especially since I have started a business by then, and was able to bring in enough money to support myself and my kids, while maintaining my lifestyle. But then he went and introduced his side piece to us. He fucking brought him into our house, introduced him to our kids, and that was enough for me to keep tormenting him. Apparently he was a new *friend* he made while *golfing*. 

He started hinting at moving to another state, one where it would be easier for him to come out. I refused, I told him that my business was here, and I was not going to start over in another state. Also the kids had their friends and extended family here, it would be unfair to uproot them.

Then he started trying to start arguments, I guess he wanted us to fight, then for me to ask for a divorce. I just stopped all those arguments in their tracks. I would just agree with whatever he said: he was right, I was wrong. And to make it up to him, how about a nice dinner and some great sex? He hated that. I knew from spying on his phone that having sex with me felt like *cheating* on his BF (the audacity of this man). I also knew that his BF was pressuring him to leave me almost every day.

He was stuck between a rock and a hard place. He started drinking, and when it got too heavy, that was when I decided that enough was enough. I wanted to ruin his life, not his health. Also, I grew up with an alcoholic father, and did not want that for my kids.

So I gathered all the evidence of his infidelity over the last 9 years, photos with different men, conversations, his Grindr profile (even though he no longer had one)... Everything. Then I hired a divorce attorney, and mailed the evidence to his employer (he has a morality clause in his contract, and adultery breaks it), all his relatives (including parents) as well as our church (his actually, I was never big on religion like him).

It was like a bomb exploded. He was fired, the congregation turned on him (for cheating, not for being gay, let's keep that straight. I would never allow me kids to be part of a church that discriminated against their father, even if he was not out), his parents wouldn't take him in after I kicked him out, and he was shamed publicly (gotta love that small town gossip mill).

 And the cherry on the top? his BF was run out of the town, and he couldn't follow him because he wanted to fight for custody of our kids.

Now almost a year later, I am a free woman. I got to keep the house, my car and my business. He got 75% of the retirement and investments accounts, but he won't be paying alimony. I got full custody, he got visitations. I also got child support.

He had to move 6 hours away to find a new job, couldn't put the last job he worked at his whole life as a reference, his relationship with his family is rocky, his reputation in town is ruined (so he can't move back amy time soon), the *love of his life* left him for good, and my kids only tolerate him because I did my best to shield them, and to tell them that he is still a good father to them. I also made sure to treat him politely, never talked bad about him, and had a lengthy talk about how their father being gay is ok, it's who he is and that it was not his fault. That the only wrong thing he did was hiding it from me.

So I guess the results of his cheating was years of guilt followed by a ruined life.

EDIT: Let's make something clear. I am not the good person in this story. We were both bad. I am not here trying to get pats on the back, or to be told that I did well. I know that what I did was messed up. I am here because I wanted to tell someone, and I can't do that IRL.",6491,0.91,407,pettyAF452,2023-03-12 12:41:18,11pkl6z,6898,High
NuclearRevenge,My Family murdered a rapist.,"   This is my grandfather’s story, it would have occurred sometime in the early 1960s. 

My grandpa comes from a very remote part of my country, even in the 60s they lived in a log cabin without a phone or electricity. He lived with his 3 brothers, his sister, his father and his mother. It was a violent household, my great-grandfather was an alcoholic. My grandpa, his siblings and his mother were accustomed to beatings, the culture of the time was to accept this as a harsh reality of the remote and difficult lives that were led so far from civilization.

My great-aunt was the youngest of the siblings, and as my grandpa and his brothers grew into young men and began working, she was left at home and began to take on the role of housekeeper as my great-grandmother was often ill. She would often use her bad health as an excuse for not stopping what happened next. My great-grandfather began raping my great-aunt at some point, most likely before she had even begun puberty. It continued for years, as the brothers all moved out and she was left completely alone. My grandpa says he truly did not know, he worried for his sister receiving the brunt of the beatings, but he didn’t know about the rape. I hope that’s true. 

When my great-aunt was 13, she became pregnant with her father’s son. The night my grandpa found out, him and his brothers snowmobiled out from town, and since none of them owned a gun, they had to use shovels to beat their father to death. The ground was frozen solid so they burnt him, which also helped to destroy the evidence I suppose. Although I’m not sure anyone ever questioned how my great-grandfather had died, these were very different times. 

My great-aunt’s son, born of incest, is afflicted with genetic issues, he can barely see and he only has a single functioning kidney. But he is happy and has healthy kids in their 20s now. My great-aunt drank herself to death in the 80s, as did my great-grandmother, so I never met them. My grandpa told he all this when he was drunk, as he has also become an alcoholic. So has my dad. The generational trauma of my family is thankfully now broken with me and my siblings, but this revenge murder, this disgusting hurt was really just another sad piece of a puzzle of abuse that started long long ago.",3952,0.97,99,[deleted],2023-03-10 17:51:02,11o4wke,4051,High

NuclearRevenge,All Army service records “lost”,"Using phone so apologies for formatting errors. 

tl;dr: Company commander was a super dick to my dad, so dad got back before leaving the service. 

This happened a few years back. My dad found out he super allergic to some kinda shrub in central Texas (Fort Hood) after he was transferred there. As a result, he was restricted to office work and prohibited by Army doctors from outdoor duties. 

His West Point grad commanding officer was a hyper-warrior kinda dude who detested soldiers who didn’t want to train 24/7. Unfortunately, he thought my dad was milking his allergies in order to avoid being a “real soldier.” My dad was also married and my mom was pregnant with my older sister, a situation that infuriated the captain because #reasons. 

The CO never, ever passed an opportunity to humiliate my dad by questioning his manhood, doubting his commitment to protecting the Constitution, disparaging his duties, etc. The CO would call him out in front of the company or debase him in front of higher HQ staff. He’d call the house at 6 am on Sunday and order Dad in for bullshit reasons, anything to piss him off. In short, he made his life a living hell. (FWIW, the First Sergeant loved my dad’s work performance and said so privately.) 

When my dad got orders to leave active duty, which enraged the CO, he found out that the CO received orders for an assignment that was a notch needed to guarantee promotions as well as other plumb jobs. Dad decided to fuck with his official records before leaving. 

As company clerk, he had full access to unit personnel files, orders, etc, which meant he also had keys to the building as well. This was during the pre-digital, pre-computer era. The night before my dad was to get out, he took all of the captain’s personnel folders and mailed them separately and anonymously  to various posts around the globe knowing full well it would take weeks to deliver them to geographically unrelated unit mailrooms around the world that may or may not open the packages in order to return them. 

It just so happened that the unit was in the field for a 2-week exercise on the day my dad left, which meant a skeleton crew would man the phones and mow lawns until they returned from the field. No one was the wiser for weeks. One of my dad’s old poker-playing sergeant buds wrote a few months later telling him that the captain went ballistic, that the missing files seriously damaged the fuckface of a captain’s career prospects since some of the files were lost in the system; therefore, the coveted assignment orders were canceled and the entire personnel record had to be reconstructed manually by the Department of the Army. My dad said it was a teaching moment for the cruel asshole that you should never fuck with your unit clerk, because even chairborne rangers know how to seriouly wound enemies, foreign and domestic.",3587,0.99,157,most_aggrieved,2023-02-17 16:00:28,114yw16,3744,High

BACKSTORY

When I was 9 my mom met a man who for the sake of the story we'll call J. J was a unremarkable man, he was a chef and he was from New York living in south Philadelphia at the time. My mom being emotionally unstable decided to give him a try after lots of past relationships not working out (seriously she has a bad taste in men). And I feel it is a good time to mention my dad is dead from a drug overdose (Philadelphia man, drugs are everywhere). So my mom was desperate for someone to be that guy who is good for her and me. She gives J a chance and out of nowhere BOOM J has cancer. Came out of the blue and my mom's heartstrings were pulled by him and she was attached to him for good. 

I was 9 at the time so ofc I was a stupid kid who never thought my mom could be wrong. Well I didn't notice her getting black eyes but my grandfather did. So one day at a corner store in my neighborhood he decided to beat J black and blue. He was stuck on the couch for days and looking back it brings a smile to my face. But he convinced my mom that my grandmother (who was manipulative) manipulated my grandfather to beat him up so we have to move. After an intervention was held (holy fucking shit I was there it was WILD) my mom had decided to move. We packed our things in our van and I held my 90 pound rottweiler on my lap and we moved to FUCKING FLORIDA.

chapter 2 ""fucking Florida""

I'm gonna admit, life kinda sucked here. For 5 years I was stuck in such a dumpster fire of a state with no family support. My mom was abused daily and I was mostly mentally abused. I also lost my great grandmother at this time and I wanted to go back to Philly for the funeral but J said no. Eventually in 2021 my mom left J. And then the worst night of my life happened.

Chapter 3 Halloween 2021

I was still in Florida (shocker) and I went trick or treating with a younger friend. At this point and time my mom was paying for J's new apartment because she just wanted him gone. Well he broke into our apartment, took my puppy for a walk (weird time to care about a dog while committing a crime but hey my dog had fun) and smashed everything. My mom decided instead of calling the police she would confront him...with me...alone...

So we went and as a precaution my mom had a knife on her. We went and when we got there there was a girl with J. A fight ensued and I called 911. I also beat the everlasting shit outta J. Unfortunately my mom couldn't see that and thought J was winning. So she stabbed him (non lethal his fat got it he didn't go to the hospital). So when police showed up they gave a good look at my mom with choke marks from the fight, and arrested her for assault and breaking and entering. 

Chapter 4 leaving Florida and having a very Merry Christmas 

Well the trial came and went, my mother is off the hook but she will be a felon until a completion of a program. So we left him in Florida and decided to move back north to new Jersey. Ik my mom breaking up with J was account to me because I pushed hard for it. Life continues. But November comes around and I received news that made me burst out in laughter. J's sister came forward and told us he shot himself in the head. I even read his suicide note and everything. I ruined his relationship with my mom and karma came back. Life goes on, and he dies unloved and alone.

TLDR: I drove my ex stepdad to suicide after convincing my mom to leave him.

Edit: thank you all for the supportive comments, I do want to clear up one thing. My mother has mental issues and she was diagnosed wrong. She was taking medicine that made her worse, not better. She's on track to get off her current medication and take new medication soon.

Edit two: I don't feel guilty about what happened. I actually feel angry that he's dead, I would rather have him live as a homeless bum with nothing in his life. Unfortunately he took the easy way out which was the bullet, but still he's dead so I get some comfort from that.",2177,0.94,148,hehehebaw,2023-02-10 08:37:49,10ytkn1,2325,High
NuclearRevenge,"Dude pays me in counterfeit currency, immediately gets arrested.","Shared this in the comments of another post, and was recommended to share it here. 

Years ago (roughly 2010) when I was doing Pizza Delivery, I delivered on campus. Pretty standard procedure, call the customer and wait in the parking lot. 

Buddy comes down, hands me money takes the pizza and walks away. Then he starts to run. I look in my hand, and one of the $10 bills is ripped in half, and the $20 is horribly counterfeit. Dudes already back in his dorm, and it's pass activated, so I can't even get in. Then I remembered I have his number in my phone from when I called him. 

So I call the store, tell them what happened, and they mark his number as a prank caller, so no more deliveries. Figured eh, that's good enough I guess.

Then as I was leaving, I see campus security, talking to a police member. (There was a check stop just before the entrance to the grounds.) 

I stop and walk up and give them the run down of what happened, give the counterfeit bill and the ripped bill to the officer, while the campus security dude is looking up the phone number in the student directory. Campus security finds out who it is, and off they go. 

10 minutes later, buddy is in the back of a police car with his dorm mate for:


Theft Under $1000 (because technically he didn't pay for the pizza) 

Possession of counterfeit currency (he had more in his dorm) 

Possession of narcotics

Possession of a controlled substance (Addy's and xanny's I believe) 

Possession with intent to sell 

Possession of stolen property


And there was another charge but I can't remember. 

I guess he posted bail a couple days later and came down to the pizza shop to have ""some words"" with me, but I wasn't working that night, so buddy started trashing the lobby and got arrested again for:


Trespassing 

Criminal Mischief

Vandalism


And they found a knife on him as well when they searched him, so there was a weapons charge too, but I think that got dropped. 

I'm not sure what happened after the second arrest, as I was never called to testify in court, but I'm going to assume he took a plea deal. He most definitely got expelled from the university though.",3065,0.99,143,DefsNotRandyMarsh,2023-02-09 12:26:10,10y210l,3208,High
NuclearRevenge,"A Fitting Twist (Super Long, My b)","TLDR: My mother used my grandmother's alzheimers/dementia to steal from her. Years later I took her house and put her on the street to recover some of the money she stole and support my grandmother.

Edit one: Typos and readability (maybe better)

Background

I had a pretty terrible childhood. Don't get me wrong, I have heard of way worse, but it was far from healthy or normal. When I was young, my parents were millionaires, my fathers parents owning several of the largest businesses in the region. They divorced before I was a teenager, and both of their lives plummetted downhill. By the time I was sixteen, I was living on my own. Drugs, alcohol, and addiction have long since killed them both. Neither of them ever worked a job since I was a teenager. Both of them died homeless before the age of 50.

Situation

I joined the military and left town without ever looking back. As more years passed, I added more and more distance (physically and mentally) from my parents. When I was 20, I learned that my mother had been arrested for stealing a large sum of money from my grandmother, who was living on her own, but in the beginning stages of alzheimers. The state ended up pressing charges against my mother because my grandmother would not. The detective told me that they had to because my mom and her POS boyfriend were ""fueling the criminal underground"" where she lived. 

I was lost and shocked. I knew my mother had problems, but until this moment, I had always viewed her as a sort of forest hippy. This is the moment that is the catalyst for my nuclear revenge. You see, my grandmother was pretty wealthy. Terrified that she would be locked away in an old folks home, she entertained the leeching of my mother and POS guy. The problem is that it was never enough. Even after my grandmother bought my mother a house down the street from her, she continued to rob her own mother blind. She also fed my underage sister a stream of drugs and brought her in on the con. It ultimately resulted in my mother and sister getting their first felony conviction. Grand theft and check fraud, which my mother tried to pin on her own daughter, ""because she was just a minor.""

A few years later, I was newly married with my first child and freshly returned from my first deployment to Iraq. We just completed another move across the country, and I am starting a new job at a new unit. I get home from work and have a strange short voicemail from my uncle (who is like the okayest guy I have ever met). It literally just says, ""My mom is in the psych ward at the big hospital in her town. She left everything in your name. I'm flying back home.""

This is where I learned that the legal document my grandma had me sign when I was 16 made me the executor of her estate, power of attorney, etc. My unit arranges a very generous amount of time off to fly across the country and deal with this bizarre scenario. She lived alone in this massive house. My mom had destroyed the house my grandmother bought her, then moved into grandma's house on the auspices of ""caring for her."" There were so many fleas inside that contractors I hired to make repairs wouldn't go inside. Needles everywhere, and for some reason, everything was an ash tray. It was an insane thing to witness/experience. 

I still refused to interact with my mom at this point of my life, but now that I had the keys to the kingdom (aka access to the pot O gold), she tried to worm back into my life with a renewed vigor. I always just told her to fuck off. My grandmother, in the meantime, had been deemed unfit to live on her own. I was 23, with a new baby and marriage, if you remember, so I made the poor decision to put my grandmother into a nursing home. I fixed up the house, rented it to create passive income so she would not deplete her savings, and headed back home.

Of course, grandma is spicy and got kicked out of her swanky retirement home when she broke a coffee cup over some other lady's head for snooping around in her room. She was apparently wearing my grandmother's shoes when she got clocked. The same woman (a resident) had propositioned me in front of my wife when we were touring the facility. She was a different kind of the same spicy as grandma. Her only option after the incident was a psych ward. So my senile grandmother moved in with my family, and she lived with us for more than five years until her care was just out of our capability. This is about the time that I exacted my revenge.

The Nuclear Option

When the state filed charges against my mother (way back when i was 20), part of her restitution included a lien that was placed against her property in the name of my grandmother for a little less than $100k. Some years later, my mother had not paid her property taxes in so long that she was about to lose the house. She called me to explain that the lien would not be paid if the house was auctioned, which I knew was not true, but I saw an opportunity. I eventually worked out a deal with her. She would sign the deed over to me, and I would then sell the house and pay for her to move somewhere else. I fly to town, meet her, and sign the deed over. 

She expected me to use my name and credit to get her a luxury apartment. She also wanted me to buy her a new truck, and let's not forget the moving company. I rented her a uhaul truck and got her a storage unit that I had paid for 6 months. Then I put her and shithead up in an extended stay for a little while. I fixed up the property and sold it to the same rental group that bought my grandmother's house shortly before. I used the money to buy annuities that enable my grandmother to live in a normal house with a live-in nurse and care at 1 to 4 ratio.. which is amazing for her. She still might run out of money because of what my mother did, and I honestly don't know what will happen then. She's got some years before I have to worry, and she is just shy of 100.

My mother was on the street within six months. The last time I saw her, she looked like the crazy person who lives under a bridge (she did at one point). She was covered in sores, balding, and methed out. She'd received a social security disability back payment of what would have been a significant amount for her. She died in a hospital less than three days later. Partied herself to death. The POS dropped her off at the curb and never saw her again. I told dude I would give him some money if he gave me the key to the storage unit. Somehow, years later, she had managed to keep it. I shared the loot with my siblings, gave POS a hundred bucks and closed that chapter of my life permanantly.",1422,0.97,91,Oscartheqrouch,2023-02-02 00:24:38,10riwc2,1513,High

**BACKGROUND: feel free to jump to story time if don't want the really long winded version.**

My previous job title was as an office service consultant / technician. What is that you may ask, well basically if it was in an office environment I was probably going to be dealing with it at some point in time. Over 21 years ago I started working as a service technician fixing office equipment (copier, printers, typewriters, faxes, etc.). The company I started working for was the local go to for everything office related from furniture, equipment, supplies, and more. The closest name brand office store was a 40 minute drive over a mountain, so it was steady work. We offered local service and delivery for everything we did / sold (this was pre-Amazon days so back then this was a big deal). After 2 years of me working there the company expanded and merged with 2 other local businesses to include PC repairs, networking, phone systems, and providing dial up service (the good old days of waiting 3 minutes or more for a webpage to load). Now prior to this merger I had already gotten in to PC work personally for myself and family / friends when the need arose, but with the merger I was finally able to learn more and expand my knowledge. So now my job included all office equipment, PC's, phone systems, and some networking. Since support service included so much most places were sold service contracts where the customer would pay a flat monthly / quarterly / yearly rate for what every they wanted included. You want us to deal with the copier/printers and you'll deal with PC issues as needed, no problem. You want us to take care of everything electrical in the office other than the actual electrical wiring, you got it. 

This went on for another 2 years and eventually a bigger company from a major city 70 miles away wanted in on all the smaller town customers they were missing out on, so they bought out the company I worked at. Basically nothing really changed accept the name on the paycheck and who had final say on things, everything else was business as usual. Now prior to being bought out things were run as a local business and that's how the customers were treated, as local customers. After about a year and a half the ""Big City"" bosses felt that since they made big city profits this should also apply to out local smaller town customers so they started increasing prices on everything to match big city numbers. This went about as well as you think, customers started seriously complaining and dropping contracts. The office supplies section was dropped completely due to most folks going to the name brand store over the mountain and still saving money as well as online ordering really starting to take off. My manager at the time had been the lead tech / service manager since I started and was on good terms with all our customers who had contracts since he maintained / sold them. He hated how things were going and knew it was a matter of time before customers dropped our services due to price hikes. He asked if me if I would join him as his lead tech if he started his own business and promised me I'd eventually be service manager as the business expanded. Me being the stupid 20 something idiot I was, I believed him and said yes.

So he started his own business and cut ties with big city company. Customers eagerly jumped ship and signed back up with the local guys they had know for years now back at local prices. The business shifted into focusing on everything office related except supplies. Our line of thinking was ""we will do anything if the price is right."" the boss shifted to sales and furniture while I was left to deal with everything technical. If the customer asked about something and he would say ""Sure thing, let me get you some numbers."" Then tell me to figure out the technical side while he'd handle the logistics. Need a security camera system for the local water treatment plant, no problem. He'd figure out the floor plan and how much cable we'd need. I would figure out what hardware was needed, camera's, DVR, wireless points. etc. and how to make it all work.

&#x200B;

**SWITCHING JOBS: Going from shit job to the promised land \*angelic chorus\*** ***AHHHHHH***

I worked for my managers new business for roughly 9-10 years as the only technician in Dick's company. We had attempted to higher several other techs but no one lasted more than a few months due to the sheer amount of things we worked on, the area we covered, and my boss being... well I'll just say it, a dick. I averaged 3000 miles a month and was working probably 50-60 hours a week for a 40 hour salary. With all my extra hours I was making less than $10 an hour, losing my sanity, got zero time off, and was generally fried from the service gig entirely. I told my boss I needed a raise to match my years of experience and actual hours put in on the job, as well as some actual time off that if I took a day off I was left the hell ALONE. He said sure we'll talk about it and then ghosted me when I tried to get time to ""talk"". I let this slide for 2 months while I started looking for another job.

I got lucky and ended up going to an open house at a local manufacturing plant that makes medical equipment. After going through and seeing what they made along with the tech that was backing it I knew I wanted to work there, I applied and got a call back in less then a week. The guy who called was very nice and we talked for a bit after the standard corporate questions, I explained how I went to the open house and was really interested in the new tech they were developing and couldn't wait to be apart of something bigger. I think this may have genuinely gotten to him because he asked me to hold for a few minutes he wanted to check something. When he got back on the line he asked if I could come in for a formal interview on site in 2 days, my response was ""absolutely!"" Two days later I do my in person interview and things go just as good as the phone interview, during the interview I explained that if I got hired I would need at least 2 weeks to let my current employer know and give them my notice. At the end the lead interviewer shook my hand and said ""I can't officially say this today, but if I were you I'd put in that 2 week notice. You'll be hearing from us by the end of the week with the couple of things we need finalized to get your employment started."" I was overjoyed, this new job would be hourly with overtime, way better pay than my current job with shift differential, 3 paid weeks vacation, and 10 days sick time. To me this was basically hitting the lottery.

&#x200B;

**STORY TIME: COMPLIANCE**

I was a field service tech for a total of 15 years, I've worked on more equipment then I can remember and enjoyed it for the most part. Mainly office equipment, PC's, and networks but I did have the occasional phone system, camera systems, fire alarms, security doors, badge systems, remote entry systems and more. Due to the sheer amount of different tech I dealt with I kept very meticulous notes, made wiring diagrams, recorded master passwords or back doors to any of the systems I didn't work with on a regular basis, and kept backups of software related to any of the installs / operations. I did this with everything unless otherwise specified by the customer, since I was going to be the guy fixing it if things went sideways. I was also in charge of training the customers on the tech. This lead to me being a serious jack of all trades and some serious burn out due to being the only tech.

I finally had the opportunity to switch jobs so I put my 2 week notice in with my old job and this is the basic conversation I had with my old boss over the phone. 

The cast is as follows:

Dick = old boss

Me =  *Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.* err I mean, Me.

&#x200B;

Dick: You're quitting? Why didn't you say something? Are unhappy with your job?

Me: I did say something and you kept brushing me off. So, yes I'm unhappy. That's why I'm giving you a 2 week notice.

Dick: There's no way I can get someone hired and trained to do your job in 2 weeks. What the hell am I supposed to do, your my only tech. How am I going to take care of all my customers?

Me: Not really my problem. But you have 2 weeks to come up with something, I'll keep doing everything till then but I'm out after 2 weeks.

Dick: Let me get back to you, I need to do some thinking.

\*insert eye roll and mentally thinking no shit Sherlock\*

Dick (A week later he calls me into his office): I'm working on getting a tech, is there any way you can stay longer then another week till I get one?

Me: No, I'm not putting off the new job since it pays so much better and has actual set hours.

Dick: What do you want? Tell me what I need to do to keep you around long enough till I get this new tech in?

Me: Seriously? Let me think.

\*I thought about it for roughly 5 minutes and came up with this\*

Me: OK, I'll tell you what. Since my new job is second shift, I'll work for you in the mornings from 9-2. My time starts when I leave my house at 9 and ends with me being back in town at 2 so i have time to get to my new job. You will transfer my company cell number into my own account since I've used it for all my contacts and personal family / friends. You will pay me hourly at the same rate as my new job including the shift differential. I get to keep my tool bag and laptop. Any emergency's will be handled in this time frame and I will be left alone after hours and on weekends. 

\*All I really wanted was the pay and cell number. The number wasn't listed on any of Dick's company sites or paperwork and I really didn't want to get a new number then have to update all my info I had used it for. I wasn't concerned about the laptop or the tool bag, I was just going for broke to see what I could get away with.\*

Dick: The pay and cell number are fine, but you have to return all company property by end of week including your tools and laptop. You can pick them up daily from the office and return them at end of day. I need access to them in case I need them to fix something. Also you will sign a non-compete for 3 years once I get the new technician to keep you from servicing my clients.

Me: OK, deal but the cell gets transferred by end of day tomorrow. I'll call you in the morning when I get to the cell company.

Dick: Deal

\*I shook his hand and went about my day\*

&#x200B;

Now I can hear all of you FLYING to your keyboards to jump into the comments to go ""YOU IDIOT!!!! You didn't get it in writing"" and you are all absolutely correct. I should have gotten all that in writing, I was burnt out, I was tired, I had no more fucks to give.

The next day I got the cell number transferred over to my name and set out business as usual. Now at the end of the week I got what should be my last check at the old rate. I turned over my tools and laptop and had a very pleasant weekend. Monday rolls around and I work the hours I said I would then go to my second Job. I do this for the week without issue. Next week kicks off and I ask if there has been any progress on getting a tech, he says yes they start next week. OK, I'll start getting the new guy up to speed on our main systems next week then. Friday comes and I notice my check is still at my old rate, it's hourly now and the hours are correct but not the rate. I try to get a hold of Dick but no answer. Office lady says he's out of service till Monday and there's nothing she can do about my check.

\*You can all see where this is heading\*

Monday rolls around and I meet the new tech and talk to Dick about my check.

&#x200B;

Me: So my check wasn't right and you ghosted me

Dick: What? No, I didn't ghost you. I was out of town in an area with poor reception. I'll talk to payroll and get you a new check cut for the difference on Friday.

Me: Uh, huh.... OK. Well I'll start going over things with the new guy, should I take him on any calls with me?

Dick: No, he's a trained tech just not used to our brand of equipment go over them with him, show him the ins and outs, the software, networking them, programming things, the usual stuff we do to get a new machine setup.

Me: OK, will do.

&#x200B;

Friday rolls up and I'm sure you are all shocked to read that payroll did not have a check cut for me. *\*dramatic fanfare DUN, DUN, DUNNNNNN\**

So I said fuck it and went home. Didn't even bother trying to call Dick, I knew I wasn't going to get an answer,  I turn just turned my cell off. Monday comes, I don't go to the old job and sleep in till noon. I left my cell off for the day and enjoyed the new job. Tuesday morning I finally kicked my cell back on and there's several voicemails and a couple texts from Dick. He's wondering where I am, why haven't I showed up for 2 days. I  calmly call him and have this conversation.

&#x200B;

Dick: Finally! what the hell where have you been for the last 2 days! I... \*I proceed to cut him off\*

Me: Do you have a check for me?

Dick: check? what are you talking about?

Me: You know exactly what I'm talking about and you know exactly what you did. You fucked me, just like you did for years and I let it happen, I thought I would help you out because I'm a nice guy and you spit in my face. We're done! Lose this number.

Dick: We're not done! You still haven't signed the non-compete. 

Me: Seriously? You're being serious, you expect me to sign a non-compete after all this.

Dick: You will or I'll sue you for breach of a verbal agreement. I have a recording of our conversation and a witness who heard you say you'd sign it. I transferred the cell number per our agreement and payed you for your time. I upheld my end of the bargain.

&#x200B;

I have no clue if any of that was true. If he did have it recorded, I'm sure it was edited to just the part where he agreed to the cell number and pay and of me agreeing to the non-compete. As for a witness unless someone was listening through the office phone there was no one else in his office when we talked. I have no clue if any of the bullshit he was saying was legal, but I did know one thing. He had sued the previous company we worked for over them verbally agreeing to pay for something and he had also recorded them. I know it dragged on for about 2 years and was settled out of court. I think it was cheaper for them to just pay him then keep dealing his bullshit. Did I want any of that, HELL NO! So I said fine leave it at the office I'll be in to sign it. I wanted done with this insane man child.

&#x200B;

**STORY TIME: The build up to sweet release**

Now you're all probably going, OK the previous section is the compliance from the title, but where's the malicious part. Oh dear reader, I was never a strong believer in karma, but from what I've heard she can be a cold fickle bitch. And I assure you she does in fact come back to bite you in the ass with poetic justice and a sense of humor.

A little over a year after signing the non-compete and being rid of Dick I was enjoying my new job, I get a phone call from one of the last big customers I did a setup and install for a few months prior to me quitting. The customer you ask? A women's abuse center that had converted an old building into a safe house for victims. Dick had managed to get the job to redo the interior network, furniture, camera systems, security doors, and the alarm systems. He had also sold them a service contract for the camera, security doors, and alarm systems where we were on call 24/7 for the next 3 years if something went wrong and they site could not remain secure we had to get it fixed, YESTERDAY. This was not a small chunk of change and it was due up front to get the best discount, but the abuse center had government backing so they got Dick to agree to half up front and then payments after a year and a half. I knew the wording on these contracts because I had to give him worst case time frames for getting things fixed if shit hit the fan (This will be important later). 

Now due to the nature of the client and job I made sure my cell number had been laminated and I literally glued it to all 3 systems with instructions to call me if they needed ANYTHING. The reason they were calling is they had had some personnel changes and needed to change door codes, not real secure if former employees can still access the building. They also wanted to setup remote camera access for new security monitoring purposes and they needed to know how to do all of this. Now if you read through the entire post you know I had made some very detailed notes as well as instructions on how to do all of this. A set of all this as well as all the credentials to log into the systems was in a nice secure binder on site. One problem, they couldn't find it.

Not to worry, I would have planned ahead and made backups of all that and kept it on my company laptop with approval from the customer right? If you said yes, you get 5 points. If you're thinking this guy sounds seriously paranoid about this stuff and probably made another copy on maybe a disc or thumb drive. AGAIN you would get another 5 points. I always kept a secure thumb drive on my keys and backed up this type of info religiously when I worked on jobs. 

*\*You may distribute these points to whichever Hogwarts house of your choosing\**

I informed the client that I was no longer with Dick's company and they would need to contact them directly to do get this taken care of and I bid them a good day. Two days later I get a call from my replacement asking me for help regarding this matter, not wanting to be a complete asshole and knowing that the abuse center needed this resolved I informed him that the droids he was looking for were in fact on the company laptop. They were hiding on the D drive in the folder called backups, there would be a folder with the clients name and all info should be right there in front of him. He asks me to hold on while he gets it. I wait on the line while I hear him fiddling with the laptop bag and booting it up.

&#x200B;

New guy = someone who was clearly not ready to take over everything I did.

Me = Me, face palming and head desk in disbelief

Dick = someone who is about to be truly fucked.

&#x200B;

New guy: OK, so I got it booted up and I don't see a folder called backups. It's not in the documents folder. Is it somewhere else?

Me: No, not the documents folder the D drive.

New guy: The what drive?

Me: OK, open up My computer you should see the C drive and the D drive right next to it.

New guy: Oh there it is, Hang on, a window popped up, it's saying in insert disc.

Me: I'm sorry, it's saying what?

New guy: It's saying please insert disc.

Me: Are you clicking the E Drive by chance?

New guy: no there's only the C and D drive.

\*Our more tech savvy readers probably know exactly what's going on\*

Me: So, just to be absolutely clear. There is only drive C and drive D listed, no drive labeled E? That's what I'm hearing correct?

New guy: Yes

Me: You didn't happen to reformat the laptop or anything like that?

New guy: No, I only do copier / printer work. Dick's kid does the PC stuff.

Me: Can you tell me what the icon looks like in the bottom left corner? is it round with 4 color square or is it 4 white squares?

New guy: Um, 4 white squares, why? 

Me: Is Dick in the office? I'm going to need to talk to him.

New Guy: No he is out right now. 

Me: OK, please have him call me ASAP I need to talk to him about this.

New guy: OK.

&#x200B;

Now Dick's kid (mini Dick, trust me fitting name) was 15 years old when I quit. I had shown him some troubleshooting stuff and he knew enough to be VERY dangerous if unsupervised. I mention this because when I turned in the laptop it was using Windows 7 (round button, 4 colors), but now it was Windows 10 (4 white squares). There was a windows 10 USB in the laptop bag, I was eventually going to upgrade it once I had made sure all the software I used was compatible. The pit of my stomach knew exactly what happened. Either Dick asked him to do something with the laptop after I turned it in or he took it upon himself to ""upgrade"" it to show his dad he could do this stuff. Pick one, but I knew he had deleted the separated partitions I had made on the hard drive to keep to crucial data safe if Windows went tits up and I needed to restore or do a clean install and not have to worry about pulling the data. What mini Dick had done was nuke the entire drive and all that backed up data was now gone.

I get a phone call the next day first thing in the morning.

&#x200B;

Dick: I was told you need to talk to me? Is this about the abuse center? I told the new guy to handle it and call you. You always kept instructions for all that shit. Just tell him where it is.

Me: Oh, I already told him where to find the info, but there's a minor problem. It's gone.

Dick: What do you mean gone? I know you kept backups.

Me: I did, it was on the laptop when I turned it in. It is no longer there.

Dick: What the hell do you mean it's no longer there? Did you remote in and delete it? I know you did stuff like that to fix things. You shouldn't have been able to that I had mini Dick make sure you couldn't.

Me: Oh he certainly did that, but he also wiped out all the backup data

Dick: What?

Me: I can't say I'm 100% sure that's what happened, but I'm like 99.99% sure that's exactly what happened.

Dick: Wait you kept multiple backups, you told me that. That thing you had on your keys you didn't give me that. Tell you what, you give me that and I won't pursue legal action since you didn't give it to me when you quit.

Me: Yeah, that's going to be a no from me.

Dick: The fuck do you mean NO! You have to give me that you didn't turn in company property. I'LL SUE YOUR ASS!!!

Me: First; that thing I had on my keys was my personal device, bought and paid for with my money. So I didn't need to to give it to you when I quit. Second; I wouldn't give it to you even if I could. I destroyed it after I quit because of the shit you just said. I knew if I kept anything related to clients and you found out you'd try and sue me like the man child you are. Third; the only reason I'm taking to you is because I want to help the abuse center, not that you give a damn.

Dick: Oh this is bullshit, your lying. Just you wait, I'm going to...

\*click\* No clue how many times he called me and texted, I just put my phone on silent and enjoyed the rest of my day. 

Now I'm sure many of you are probably calling bullshit, there's no way you remained that calm and said that. Remember I worked for Dick for 9 years, I knew his habits.

1. I had 2 days between the abuse center calling me and new guy calling me. I knew the new guy would need my help if he couldn't find the instructions I left. Lots of tech jargon involved but it took me a week of mock building and tweak everything to get those systems setup exactly how the customer wanted it and if he factory reset them to use the default credentials, well... enjoy doing it the very hard way.
2. I had an entire day between Dick calling me back and talking to the new guy. I had a raging justice boner the entire time. I had his nuts in a vice and I knew it.

&#x200B;

**MALICE! Best served cold, with a side of mint.**

Previously on this long ass post:

* I signed a non-compete with old dick boss who pretty much fucked me over for 10 years and I moved on with my life.
* Dick boss had a client that he needed my help with.
* Dick boss threatens to sue me if I don't do what he wants.
* I hang up on Dick boss and hatch a devious scheme.

After hanging up on Dick boss, I was heart broken and felt that it was my responsibility. NAY! My duty to contact the abuse center and inform them of the situation. All joking aside this could have actually put people in danger if not resolved somewhat quickly. I talked with the secretary and asked to speak to her boss. Luckily it was the same woman in charge from when I installed the systems, she knew how much I cared and busted my ass to get things exactly the way they wanted it.

&#x200B;

Karma = The big boss woman, Ah yes, IRONY!

Me = Our valiant hero who only wishes to protect the innocent (and maybe fuck over his old boss in the process)

Dick = Former boss who done fucked up big time

&#x200B;

Karma: Hello, Me it's been a while, I understand you wanted to talk to me about the issues we need resolved with the system you setup for us.

Me: I do. I wanted to inform you that sadly I no longer work for Dick's company. 

Karma: Oh, well that's to bad. So why are you calling me if you won't be helping us get things fixed.

Me: Well, I wanted to inform you of the entire situation along with reasons as to why I can't help and give you some options to get this resolved.

* I proceed to inform her of the non-compete and all the following information is just my best ""Guess"" and I am offering up my ""opinion""  free of charge. She can choose to act as she sees fit.
* I let her know that Dick's company most likely does not have the credentials and documentation needed to perform the tasks she needs done. I can't say for certain though \*wink wink\*
* I inform her if Dick's company does not have the proper info they may suggest resetting the equipment and it will most likely take even longer to get things fixed as well as their current setup being wiped out and only the factory codes will work. Also the system will most likely not function the way they need it to. Again, I can't say for certain. \*nudge nudge\*
* I kindly reminder her of the service contract she has on the equipment and to look carefully at the wording on it as it may come in very handy. \*say no more sir\*
* I let her know that I wish there was some way I could consult with her or help but due to the non-compete there is no way I can help her since she is currently Dick's client.
* I make several suggestions on how to to possibly deal with the situation after reviewing some things and getting options.

After all this she thanks me for my time and said she was going to be busy the next few days.

NOW here is where all the malicious compliance comes to a head. I mentioned above for Karma to REALLY look at that service contract for one major reason.

* The wording on her contract stated that if Dick's company was unable to resolve any issues the customer had within 3 days then Dick's company was on the hook for any expense the customer incurred to work around said issues. Now this was pretty standard wording on our service contracts but they were mostly for smaller equipment and were worded as 2 business days. Basically if company can't fix a printer or copier and customer has to go get things out sourced company had to pay for it. Karma's contract was worded as 3 days do to the site being occupied every day and weekends had no visitors allowed. 

I knew this because when Dick was selling the contract he had me talk it up in front of the abuse centers board. To me worse case scenario meant the main systems all somehow got nuked. We'd be out same day to confirm DOA equipment and over night new units that day. Again, worst case it takes 2 days to get a system in on site. I drop it in place, reprogram and boom they're back up. The door systems all had emergency push bar on the inside and the 2 inner steel doors had keys if power and back up power was dead, they were kept offsite for security.

Now onto to possible situations and solutions. 

* Since they could not remove the old codes and enter in new ones for the personnel changes this posed a security risk. To remedy this Karma should hire outside security to be on site until the old codes could be deactivated.
* If company cannot get the system working soon then Karma should contact the manufacture's support line and request an on site technician to come out and fix it for them. I know what took me a week to do would probably take a certified tech a couple hours at most since they know the systems inside and out. However those techs are hellishly expensive and getting them on site quickly... you'd better get some lube and try to spread your cheeks for that incoming railing.
* If company cannot fix issues then why did they sell the service contract to begin with, if they cannot service the equipment Karma should get the contract cancelled and try to get money back since Dick's company did not support the products they said they would

I got a phone call 2 days later from Dick who was surprisingly non threatening to start.

&#x200B;

Dick: So, Me. I'm in a bit of a bind here. I need you to help me out with the abuse center. 

Me: What do you want me to do? I signed a non-compete and I sure as hell am not helping you for free.

Dick: I thought about it and I can hire you as a consultant to go out and get things fixed for me so you're not competing. You'll be working for me.

Me: And how much will you be paying me to consult?

Dick: How does $150 a day sound?

Me: $150 a day? I don't know that sounds awful cheap to me.

Dick: CHEAP! That's way more then you get at your new job.

Me: You misunderstood me, I meant cheap for you.

Dick: Explain!

Me: I'm just guessing it's probably costing you a lot more then $150 a day to pay for outside security around the clock at the abuse center.

Dick: How did you... YOU, IT WAS YOU! I'M GOING TO...

\*click\*

Phone rings again, I pick up to more screaming 

\*click\*

Phone rings a couple more times and I send it to voice mail.

I think it was about 4 hours later he called me again.

Me: Hello? \*slight inflection of joy in my tone\*

Dick: \*silence for maybe 10 seconds\* How much?

Me: Well to be honest, I can't help you.

Dick: WHAT?

Me: Obviously I have to have a paper trail since I can't trust you and for me to consult I'd have to give you a detailed invoice that would list why and what I'm consulting for. However, due to the rather descriptive non-compete you made me sign that specifically states I may not services any of ""your"" clients for 3 years. My hands are tied, legally speaking.

Dick: But...

Me: Good luck with that!

\*click\*

I immediately blocked his number and laughed so I hard I cried for probably 30 minutes. I don't think I've never felt that good.

&#x200B;

**FALLOUT! Hazmat suits suggested!**

I got some details from the secretary at the abuse center, she was a chatty Kathy and loved drama. She talked my ear off when I did the install so I called her a couple months later. 

* Karma ended up having to get an on site tech from the manufacturer to reset and redo everything, not sure how long it took but I know it wasn't cheap.
* On site security was kept in place till the system was back up and running.
* Karma and the board went after Dick for all the contract money, the expenses incurred, the installation cost, equipment costs, even the legal fees. From what the secretary told me he settled out of court, she didn't have an exact number or what all they got him for but it was damn close to 6 figures total.

I ran into several secretaries from other businesses I used to service and got even more details later that year. 

* His tech quit and he ended up selling the service side of the business to a company over the mountain.
* He solid his local storefront and downsized to an office closer to his home and focused mainly on furniture installs.

Just last year I ran into one of the owners from back when I started as a tech, him and Dick were friends? And according to him Dick is out in Texas working at a furniture place while the wife / ex? and kids are still in state. He used her name and I didn't bother asking the status. I genuinely didn't care.",3542,0.96,144,rhunter1980,2023-01-29 22:59:14,10ot97e,3686,High
NuclearRevenge,Food thieves at uni got lesions from my food,"Please LMK if this breaks rule #3.

I was reminded of this by a post somewhere else where someone asked if they could legally put laxative in their coffee creamer at work because it was being stolen. (The answer was no BTW.)

In first year at uni somewhere in the west of England I lived in a large Georgian student house which had 23 under / post grads living in it - all lads. We had 3 kitchens, but some people would raid other fridges, and I was sick of people stealing my food.

In microbiology we were doing some experiments with an orthopoxvirus. Think of it as a much less severe version of cowpox (harmless enough they'd let first year students use it with only masks, gloves and glasses). Anyway, one of my lab partners didn't use sterile technique on her inoculating loop particularly well and ended up with a blister on her lips. (She used to heat it too quickly and create an aerosol.)

Eventually I was fed up with the thievery and took a little sample of said virus and added it to a block of cheese. A couple of days later the 2 perps also had a couple of blister-type lesions around their mouths which lasted a few days and meant they didn't want to go out.

They had an inkling it was me, but I made some cheese on toast in front of them, while ensuring I wasn't cross-contaminating, so came away unscathed (the cheese gets hot enough to denature the virus).

My food was never touched again, but I often think how risky this was.",3551,0.97,185,TheManWith2Poobrains,2023-01-23 16:43:32,10jpwka,3736,High

NuclearRevenge,World's Nicest Guy Gets Revenge on Cheating Ex-Fiancée By Living His Best Life,"This is about a buddy of mine, the most decent guy you could ever be lucky enough to call a friend, and how he got nuclear revenge on his cheating ex-fiancée who dumped him for his best friend, all the while still being the most upstanding, greatest guy you can imagine. I’ve pieced this story together from things my friend and his wife have told me over the decade that we’ve been friends. There's not enough room to tell you how great this guy is, but believe me, he's been there for me like a rock when things were darkest. 

**Cast of characters:** Let’s call my friend Buddy, the ex-fiancée Lisa, and the hapless best friend “Richard” aka Dick. As you read this story, you have to always remember that Buddy is literally the greatest guy on the planet. Dick is, well, kind of a dick, annoying as hell, but my buddy says he always means well, and his heart is in the right place. Lisa is as big of a cheating, lying, self-centered narcissist as ever walked the face of the earth. Other people are Ray, another high school friend of Buddy and Dick, Jenn, Buddy’s wife, and Bob and Linda, Dick’s dad and mom. All the names are fake. 

**The Background:** Our story begins when Buddy, Dick, and Lisa are all in middle school together at a typical suburban high school outside of Southern City: football team, Friday Night Lights, etc. The three of them are all in marching band, inseparable friends. If you know band types, Buddy plays the French Horn, Dick plays the tuba. IDK what Lisa played. Probably the flute because it’s a cliche. Buddy and Lisa are boyfriend/girlfriend, and Dick is a happy third wheel. As they get older, Buddy and Lisa explore the physical side of their relationship, like normal high school kids do, while Dick is happy to be a player. He’s decent-looking, so he has no problem getting action, and also occasionally makes use of the professional women in their town. This will be important later.

Buddy and Lisa, typical good students, go on to Prestigious Public University in Southern City. Dick drops out of high school, but, a self-taught programmer, winds up with a decent career in tech. Buddy graduates college early with honors, and proposes to Lisa at his graduation dinner, with a small diamond because he’s put himself through school and that’s all he can afford. She accepts. Buddy gets a job at Fancy Consulting Firm in Prestigious City, Lisa finishes college back home in Southern City. Comes time for Lisa to graduate, Buddy helps his fiancée also get a job at Fancy Consulting Firm. During her last Spring Break, she flies up to Prestigious City to visit Buddy and interview for her job, gets pregnant. Flies back home, tells Dick she’s “in trouble,” he takes her to the abortion appointment. Neither of them tell Buddy. Ever. I heard about this from Buddy’s wife, who heard it from Dick one night when he was drunk. AFAIK Buddy still doesn’t know. Buddy, if you ever read this, sorry dude. I should have told you but it wasn’t my place. 

**The Betrayal:** Lisa realizes, when she doesn’t want to tell Buddy about her abortion, that she can’t marry him, but she’s not brave enough to break it off. Instead, she ghosts him and he finds out through the HR Department of Fancy Consulting Firm that she’s turned down her job offer and won’t be moving to Prestigious City after all. Buddy calls Dick and Dick says, “Dude, I’m sorry, but it’s worse. Lisa and I are now a couple. You can punch me in the face next time we get together.” Somehow, Buddy and Dick decide that Lisa isn’t worth destroying their friendship, so they stay best friends: going hunting together on Dick’s family place in the country etc. Lisa is not happy about this, but Dick tells her that if she makes him choose, he’ll choose Buddy. 

**The Follow-up:** Buddy takes a year or so to get over it, and starts dating again. Pretty soon, he meets Jenn and falls madly in love, crazy in love, and to make things better, Jenn is just as crazy about him. In less than six months, they’re engaged. Now, the thing you have to understand is that Lisa is drop-dead gorgeous. She’s not tall enough to be a model, just average height, but she’s got these giant blue eyes and super-long eyelashes, long, shiny wavy dark brown hair, an exquisite face, and a terrific figure. She’s prettier than a movie star — and being beautiful is really important to her. Jenn is pretty enough, but regular, and she really and truly DGAF. 

Dick travels to Prestigious City, without Lisa, to meet Buddy’s fiancée. He and Jenn really get along (Jenn gets along with everyone) and reports back to Lisa that Buddy is really happy, his fiancée Jenn is awesome, etc. Lisa gets jealous and pouty when she hears about Jenn's Ivy League education but then Dick makes a point of telling her that Jenn is nowhere near as hot as Lisa, so she’ll stop sulking, at least until she gets an invitation to the wedding. Lisa pitches a fit, refuses to go, and tries to prevent Dick from going, but there’s no way in hell he’ll miss his best friend’s wedding, so he goes stag. NBD, it’s a super small, low-key wedding. At the wedding, Dick reconnects with another high school friends of theirs, a guy named Ray, whose date to the wedding was actually someone else’s wife. Ray has a thing for married women. This is important. 

Buddy and Jenn go on living their best lives. At some point, Buddy gets an Ivy League MBA. His career takes off like gangbusters, they pop out a couple of kids, Jenn quits her career to be a SAHM, they’re rich as hell, still crazy in love, and blissfully happy. A couple of times a year, the guys get together and bring their wives along. At some point, Dick and Lisa get married — Buddy and Jenn are \*not\* invited to the wedding, by the way. But the women get along okay. Jenn gets along with everyone and Lisa is happy because she’s thinner and prettier than Jenn, especially after both women have been through pregnancy and childbirth. The years tick on.

**Things get complicated:** One day, this is around 2008, when Buddy, Jenn, and Dick are all playing WoW together, Dick gets them on TeamSpeak and tells a helluva story. Dick and Lisa have continued to hang out with Ray, their high school friend who has a thing for married women. He’s turned his eye on Lisa, who, even after three kids, is even hotter than she was in college. She’s leaned heavily into the MILF role, meanwhile Dick has had enough of her nonsense. He’s decided to divorce her three times, but each time, when he tells her, she cries and gets all pouty, they have “one last time” unprotected sex, she gets pregnant, and bam, Dick and Lisa’s three kids. Ray goes in hard with his practiced seduction routine, and Lisa cries to Dick that she just can’t stand it, and can she please just have sex with Ray. They do, Dick watches, goes in for sloppy seconds, and Lisa and Dick’s marriage enters its Suburban Swinger era. Dick gives Jenn and Buddy every gory detail over the course of a two-hour conversation while they’re all killing wolves on low-level alts in Elwynn Forest and Lisa is upstairs with a bottle of wine. It’s obvious, during their next visit, that Dick wants to join in sexy fun times with Buddy and Jenn, but they’re not into that, and after an awkward five minutes, things go back to normal. The kids all play together, the women make small talk, and Buddy and Dick hang out together doing the normal things that guys do. Dick tells Buddy that the reason they’re into swinging is that he gets off on watching Lisa being degraded, and Lisa gets off on making Dick feel like he isn’t man enough for her. This marriage is not happy, but Dick wants to stay married, because Lisa is hot as hell, she’s got a solid career, and he’s a mid-level tech guy with a GED who works from home while he takes care of three kids, so he’ll never be able to do better. 

**Things get worse:** Dick calls Buddy to chat. His marriage has gone to hell. Lisa has, in her words, “met the love of her life.” She’s moved on from Ray and from the swinging scene and is now having an affair with a guy from the accounting department at her job. She’s staying out all night. She’s ignoring the kids. Dick and Lisa take the kids on a swank vacation to try to focus on their family and spends all her time crying because she misses her AP and she doesn’t want to be there. She doesn’t want a divorce because she knows she’ll lose the kids (she’s drunk all the time) and she doesn’t want to have to pay Dick child support. She wants him to let her live whatever life she wants while he does all the cooking and cleaning and childcare, and still brings in 50% of the household money. Lisa also will not STFU about how she could have married Buddy and been like Jenn, a SAHM in a giant 5000 square foot house with six bedrooms and a pool. I should mention that Buddy has also had a Neville Longbottom-style glow-up and gone from a nerdy band kid to a silver-haired super-confident high-level executive in a top-tier consulting firm, whereas Dick is still the guy working from his basement in sweatpants, covered in Dorito crumbs. He has been working on himself, but there’s no way he can compete in Lisa's eyes, although both Buddy and Jenn tell me about Dick's great qualities. Lisa is jealous, hopping mad, and she blames Dick. 

“Dude. Trust me, I know, she is bad news. Leave her,” Buddy tells his friend. It is the last conversation they will ever have. 

**Holy @#$%\^ this is terrible:** Buddy gets a call at work one afternoon. It’s Bob, Dick’s dad. Dick got drunk, woke up Lisa at 3:00 am, told her that he’d never loved her, that she’d never been enough of a woman for him, that he’d been visiting prostitutes during most of their marriage, and that he hoped she would go to hell. Then, he blew his brains out in such a way that the splatter went all over her and all over the bed. When the ambulance got there, she was hysterical, sitting on the curb outside the house, screaming over and over again, “Kill me too, it’s all my fault, it’s all my fault.” Later, Bob would call Buddy to tell him that Lisa specifically says he is not welcome at the funeral. Bob and Linda, Dick’s parents, step in to take care of the three little kids (who did nothing wrong and do not deserve this) while Lisa does nothing but work and drink. 

**The Coup de Grace:** About a year later, Buddy flies to Southern City to put flowers on Dick’s grave and visit with Dick’s parents, Bob and Linda. Bob is still in shock, but he and Linda have taken Lisa in as a daughter (Lisa’s mom is dead and she’s NC with her dad and step-mom) to try and help her through this as much as they can. “Why did Lisa say it was all her fault, and why did she ban you from the funeral,” Bob asks Buddy. “What don’t I know? What's the rest of the story? Why did Dick do it?” 

**The moment of ultimate revenge:** Buddy thinks for a minute, and decides that it will help Bob and Linda to understand the tragedy that happened to their son if they know the full story. *So he tells them everything.* 

Bob and Linda have continued to do everything for the three kids, and they continue to treat Lisa well, because that is best for the children, but the clock is ticking. Lisa’s remarried now. When the kids are old enough, Bob and Linda will tell them the whole story. The youngest kid will be 18 soon. 

Buddy is still grieving over his friend. 

**Summary:** What did Buddy do to get revenge on his cheating ex-fiancée? 

1. Stayed friends with the guy who “stole” her, letting her know how important she was to him vs. the friendship. 
2. Moved on and married someone smarter, nicer, and less pretty, letting her know how important her ~~best quality~~ only good thing about her was to him. 
3. Had a hell of a successful career, causing her much jealous anguish.
4. Had a massive glow-up between 30 and 40, causing her much jealous anguish.
5. Had a terrific marriage, causing her much jealous anguish and also letting her know that the problem in their relationship was not him.
6. Respected her boundaries when she un-invited him to his best friend’s funeral, causing best friend’s dad to ask the fateful question that, IMO, ticks this over from karma to nuclear. 

PROOF that living well is indeed the best revenge. 

Sucks about Dick, though, Buddy says he was the kind of guy who would come to your house when all hell broke loose, clean your fridge and make a five-star dinner with whatever he could find. Nuclear vengeance wasn’t worth the cost. I wish I had known him.",2863,0.97,156,Unlikely_Win_Revenge,2022-12-28 23:23:58,zxwt18,3019,High
NuclearRevenge,You're gonna out me as gay to everyone? Prepare to have your entire future go up in flames,"This was almost 7 years ago. 

I grew up in a small town from hick country. Always knew I was gay, everyone else is homophobic, was planning on staying in the closet till I move out, etc. you know the song. 

7 years ago, a certain senator from Vermont announced his candidacy for President of the United States, and me being the edgy high school senior who couldn't keep his mouth shut, I went all in on the online activism. Mostly on reddit (r/ sanderforpresident), but most importantly on twitter where I had a fan account with \~10K followers that I wouldn't shut up about. This didn't go over well with everyone but people knew my politics and I was just a terminally online 17 year old high schooler so no one took it seriously, I guess my parents got a few comments at church but that was about it.

Even at school, I lacked self awareness and wouldn't shut up about the democratic primaries. I wasn't antisocial or anything but most of the people I hung out with were dorkier than me, and at least as unselfaware. 

Here is one thing I didn't account for: If you harass your entire rural hick town to follow your twitter account, maybe don't use that account to like gay porn. These were likes from half a year prior, so you had to scroll a while to find them. But a guy from one of my classes, let's call him Alex, went through that trouble and sent screenshots to practically everyone at school plus my parents. This wasn't easy for me but the landing was softer than I expected, my parents took a week or so to adjust but were eventually fine with it; other adults in town avoided me but that wasn't much of a change, and people at school picked on me for a while but it dwindled down fast. I still was livid with what Alex did, and I wasn't letting it slide. Besides it wasn't entirely harmless either, my parents were willing to live with it but were still homophobic and outwardly so, and either way who wants to have their porn history shown to their parents.

Alex was a top of the class straight-A student with an ivy league aspirations, and definitely ivy league qualifications (plus he could go the legacy route through his dad). His future was also fully dependent on his parents' money. I needed to hit these two aspects of Alex's life and turn them into smoke.

Alex's parents were kind of the movie cliché of small town rich folk, old money, dad is a lawyer, good standing with the community and the church, conservative, involved in local and state politics, etc.

Alex was a spoiled rich kid. Nothing intrinsically wrong with that but it comes with its fair share of ""rebellious"" dumb things you do as a spoiled rich kid. 

So here's how I used his past to destroy his future:

* Alex dealt drugs for a month when he was 15. Again he was a well put together valedictorian so totally out of place but he just wanted to do something on the edge I suppose. I knew this because we bought our weed from him through a friend one time. He still had the conversations and was more than happy to oblige by handing me the screenshots which I sent to his parents. They obviously accused me of fabricating them out of revenge so I asked my friend to show them the conversation first hand next Sunday after sermon, which he did.
* A year before outing me he impregnated a girl who ended up getting an abortion he paid for, with the quid pro quo she wouldn't say who the father is. It was already too late for her since her parents knew she was pregnant so she didn't mind taking the entire fall herself. I knew that girl pretty well, we weren't friends but we were close politically and would have the occasional discussion. She was livid with Alex for outing me and decided, after I not so subtly suggested it, to do a call-out post on the town's Facebook group, with screenshots of their conversations.
* Alex had an altright trolling account that he used to harass black people. I'm talking hard r nwords, monkey jokes, IQ-graphs and the likes. Multiple people, mostly the one black kid who went to this school reported him but it was practically impossible to prove he was behind the account, until I realized he sometimes logged into it on the schools computers and gave that as a tip to the principal. I'm not sure what the IT guy technically did, but he caught him red handed and he ended up getting a weeks suspension and having to apologize in front of the whole school.

So Alex went from model son, to junkie baby murdering nazi overnight. His parents decided to kick him out without a penny after graduation. He still got into an ivy league school but without his Parents support he had to juggle school and a part time job and dropped out a year in. 

He's now apparently a divorced absentee father who's involved with two multi level marketing schemes at once. From a valedictorian who was destined to become a DC lawyer... to that.",4694,0.94,136,Background_Wave2513,2022-12-28 15:57:45,zxmbbd,4830,High
NuclearRevenge,"Harass my sweet little sister? Fine, I will get you evicted... Or worse.","January 2021 I (30F) moved my camper van/mobile home closer to my sister's (26F) flat, to help her recover after a stay in hospital. She had been struggling and was not happy in life, so my goal was to care for her and raise her spirits, while helping her organise and stabilise her life. 

I was shocked when on my first night there, I was woken at 4am by enraged screaming from her downstairs neighbour. The woman downstairs was mid fight with her fella, and I distinctly heared a plate being thrown. I was shocked by how loud they were being, for it to be audible from outside their flat. It was very unsettling for both myself and my sister, as my sister and I have a lot of PTSD from growing up in an abusive household. 

In the morning I asked my sister about it, and she said that was normal, and that you can't say anything to them about it, or they will start on you. She goes on to explain that one time she had left a note, asking them to keep it down, and the fella had come outside and banged loudly on her front door, trying to fight her. Bare in mind that this guy is 40+ balding, 6ft+ drunk, and she is a tiny thin 4ft11 lass with autism. 

This pissed me off big time, but not nearly as much as when sister admitted that one time, she had been crying to herself in her flat, and the down stairs neighbour decided to call the police on her for it as revenge for asking them to keep it down. Naturally I was completely done at this point. So like any good admin lady, I got to work. 

I opened a complaint with the housing association and logged every incident of violent drunken behaviour that took place. They, as expected, were reluctant to do anything at all, and told me to just call the police if it got bad. I remember thinking to myself, pffft, I can't see us needing the police... But I was wrong. 

Some nights their fighting was so intense I had to anonymously call 101 and report the DV, for her own safety. This, and the letters that started arriving from the housing association put me on their radar, and soon things got worse. They were in trouble for the noise, the state of their flat, fly tipping rubbish on the corner, an out of control dog that attacked my cat, threatening me, threatening sister, spitting on her door, trying to steal her cat, trying to run over my cat, banging on the door and making threats, playing loud music to keep sister awake on college nights and so much more. The police started being called a lot, and it was getting so stressful. I was starting to regret making that first complaint. But the rest of the neighbours were on our side, as it effected them just as much. I felt supported by them, and decided to just keep pushing and demanding a solution. I knew eventually the council / housing association would cave in and either rehouse my sister, or, better yet, rehouse the neighbour. 

By autumn 2022 things had reached boiling point. I installed a ring door bell in Jan 2022 for parcel deliveries, but it ended up being the silver bullet that took the crazy woman down. A multi agency meeting took place over teams and they finally upped the pressure on the neighbour after I presented my evidence to them. I remember crying after that meeting, as I left it feeling that they didn't think we had enough to push for an eviction. I was even criticised for having not called the police enough to support my harassment claim. But I gave them my flash drive full of reports anyway, and hoped they would at least look at them. 

Not all was lost though. The neighbour's fella was told not to attend the property again, and the hope was to distance them, so she could get her life together. She had been given multiple welfare meetings to try and turn her behaviour around and they tried to support her by offering ways to dry out and pick her life up. They really tried to peacefully resolve the situation, and we were even asked to make some adjustments to help her see that we didn't despise her, and our reporting wasn't malicious. We just felt unsafe and she was being loud, messy and a nightmare neighbour. 

But this woman just didn't care. She continued to let her partner back at the flat, and they inevitably fought. The police were called twice in a 24hr period, and I wasn't even the one to call. The shouting was so bad, another neighbour called them. After the police left on the second time, she took a small bag of stuff and left. 

Then.... Silence. 

Days went by and nobody saw or heard from either of them. 

After a week, I still waited with baited breath, for the return of the crazy and all of her bullshit. But it never came. And now it never will. 

By week 3 we had started to relax, assuming she had finally gone to rehab or was drying out somewhere safe. Nobody on the street knew where she had gone, and it was uncommonly calm on the block. 

And then, I get the first call. 
Friday : It's the police, informing me that they have reviewed the mountain of evidence I provided and they are keen to go for a harassment charge all of a sudden. Now anyone who has endured harassment will tell you how flipping hard it is to prove. So I was happy we were finally being listened too. I was even praised for how detailed and professional the reports were... Hence why I should have put this in r/prorevenge... But wait... Its not over yet

We know full well that the housing association needed the harassment charge to get her removed from the property. So without even being told, we knew what was coming next. She would likely be told she is being evicted, and our problems would all soon be over. 

Monday : I get a call telling me a flat is available on the block if I'm interested. They know my situation and living outside in a transit van isn't ideal. I'm sent the paper work to apply and it fill it in. I'm at this point feeling bad. If I'm housed in her flat, I'd feel guilty for having been the force behind her removal. (yeah, I know, it's her own fault, but you can surely understand why I would feel so weird about it.... So imagine how we felt when this happened.)

Tuesday : email from the lovely chap at the housing association, asking if we had heard about neighbour. I miss understood the email and thought they had asked if we had heard from her. And I email back explaining nobody had seen her in nearly a month. 
He replies. Adult services reported to us this morning that neighbour had passed away last night. 

I start bawling. I cry, what have I done. That woman drove us absolutely mad, and she was a horrible person. But she did not deserve to die. I'd wished for the day when I'd se her being evicted. I had joked about sitting outside with a beer on the lawn. But not once had I considered she might die. 

While I'm not currently aware of how she passed away, I do know that on the Monday she'd been in a meeting with social services, police and the Housing association. They likely told her about the charge and her inevitable eviction. She and her scruffy fella seem to have gone out and just took too much. I don't think it was suislide, as the officer we had been dealing with came round on the Wednesday to tell us he was naturally dropping the charges. I expressed guilt and he told me it was inevitable when that much drugs and alcohol are involved. 

I'm heartbroken. I know it's not the case, but it feels like this is my fault. I never thought for one second a woman as selfish and blind to the impact she had, would let this happen to her. We have left flowers by her door, and for the first few nights after she passed I lit candles for her. I'm sad that she never took the help offered. Because if she had stayed away from her fella, and tried to slow down on the drink and drugs, she might have had a chance. 

Ultimately, I feel this is nuclear revenge, as rather than getting my sister's crazy neighbour evicted, I got her killed. And I feel terrible.",972,0.98,82,Specialist_Impact_32,2022-12-28 16:54:47,zxnsrr,1054,High
NuclearRevenge,The best Christmas gift I could’ve asked for.,"When I was 6, I was molested by my grandfather, and repeatedly was up until the age of 11.

I would typically be sent to his house on weekends, occasionally with my mother staying for visits during the week, due to my grandma being dead due to cancer she was never around to witness it, and he would always pressure me to do things with him and NEVER say anything to anyone about it.

I felt filthy and pissed each time it happened.
And because I was so young, I couldn’t do much to physically stop it.

Until Christmas Eve.

For Christmas my mother was visiting my grandfather to celebrate and due to her being an Alcoholic, she was asleep in one of the guest bedrooms.

So my grandfather was in the kitchen, cleaning up and I was watching TV.

I then heard a thud in the kitchen and rushed to check on what it was, it was Grandpa, with a face dropped on one side and a numb leg.

I quickly asked “Grandpa, what’s wrong?”

He could only answer in a thick slur, and that’s when I knew he was having a stroke, we learned about it in school, we had also learned how to call 911 to save the person, but that wouldn’t be necessary. 

And realising this, I simply stood up, smiled at him, keeping eye contact, and walked back to the living room to continue watching TV, and then I waited, watching movies, until it hit the mark where it was most likely too late for anything to save him, I then got my mom and told her what was happening in the kitchen.

Mom called 911 and stayed with Grandpa until the ambulance came, Mom hopped in the ambulance to follow grandpa too, while I was sent to the next door neighbours’ house.

And he died in the hospital, and up until the funeral I had to play the façade that I was the innocent granddaughter.

And to this day, nobody in my family knows what I did.",5379,0.97,326,_Iseerightthroughyou,2022-12-27 08:15:02,zwgkvy,5705,High
NuclearRevenge,The incoming wave of fake bully stories. Just stop!,"A week ago, we allowed the first bullying story in a long time. It was actually pretty good and felt justified. But now, a lot of users with throwaway accounts are trying to farm their own version of the same story. 

What are the odds that when you allow one story of someone getting their face broken, multiple half assed versions start to pop up including the same outcome? 

Here at NR, us mods are quick to spot karma farms they show up. This has happened many times over the years. When a topic goes big, people try to cash out on it.

A few previous examples would be the revenge porn stories from a few months ago and the garden/property sabotage stories from years ago. Honestly, there’s too many to remember. 

Just stop! Post honest stories that aren’t lazily written in under 5 minutes. WE as a whole can spot the fake stories. Especially, us mods when we’ve had to sort through them for years. I’d say we’re accurate most of the time. If we really dug into the dubious stories and investigated, the user would simply vanish.

But all of this has me wondering. Should we even allow throwaway accounts? Or just go back to manual post reviewing despite the great amount of effort it requires?",1561,0.97,72,claycam6,2022-12-24 13:50:08,zuha6n,1633,High
NuclearRevenge,Leave me for dead? I'll destroy your fraternity.,"This is longer than I intended it to be, but fuck it.

After high school ended I was in a pretty bad place mentally, so I decided to make some extremely unwise decisions during my first year of college. I was basically always on something in order to keep what I later realized was severe depression at bay. For a variety of misplaced reasons, I also decided to join a fraternity. It was a convenient way to keep getting the things I thought I needed at the time but mostly I just craved human connection in a way that I thought being a ""brother"" would bring. Well, I didn't see it for a while but I was wrong.

The fraternity had a house on campus that was allocated to them, but it might as well have been off campus because of how crazy the parties were. Campus Police would rarely pass by, let alone come in, no matter how much noise was being made. Still, that made it the perfect place for me. I could let loose and escape the sadness that followed me around during the day without being bothered and the people there seemed to like me well enough that they at least tolerated my being around so often.

At first it was just ""official"" parties on the weekends and then every weekend, thursday nights, wednesday nights, until at one point I was spending hours drinking there every night of the week to hide from myself. Before I knew it, my first semester was over and the shallow friendships I had made through the bonds of getting ridiculously fucked up had started to pay off, or so I thought. They told me they'd be extending an offer to be a pledge next semester. For those that don't know, pledging is a process that lasts (for this particular chapter of this fraternity) one semester and is something that you have to go through to officially become a brother (member) of a fraternity. I was ecstatic.

My second semester rolls around and I'm given the invitation in traditional, stupid, ritualistic fraternity fashion. Once again, I was ecstatic. The thought that I was actually wanted and valued by these people, who I thought had it all figured out, felt like it would be the highlight of my year.  I never really fit in with most members of the fraternity, because other than excess consumption of drugs and alcohol we didn't really have much in common, but I started to look up to these guys. While most of my time there passed me by in a haze of my own creation, the moments that I remembered made them seem like kind, cool, and genuine people.

Although most of my ""friendships"" during that year were with the people from this particular fraternity, I had made some friends in my own dorm hall as well. One night after pregaming in someone's dorm- I was happy for any excuse to start drinking at 3pm- a couple girls came up to me. They asked why I was pledging at that particular frat, given its reputation. Why someone as nice as me would want to be around people like that. I asked what they were talking about and they told me that particular frat house as a reputation as a place where girls shouldn't get too drunk (trying to be as not-graphic as possible here). I told them that it must be a rumor that started because of guys who already graduated because there was no way any of the brothers I knew would ever do something like that. I second guessed my sense of belonging for the first time that night, but was too starved for human connection to seriously consider that I might not be making the best choices. Still, a small crack had formed in the facade I had built around these people.

Another night, I overheard a couple of the brothers talking when I woke up to use the bathroom, talking about how they desperately needed members to keep the house and how it was a shame that they had to let me become a brother at the end of the semester because they'd normally never let someone like me in. Fine, I thought, that's how these three feel but most of the others like me and actually want me here! Wrong. But my life was in pieces before I got to college and I was so desperate for friends and a sense of belonging that I was willing to rationalize anything to keep the lie going.

One night while doing a traditional, stupid, ritualistic fraternity event (read: consuming copious amounts of alcohol to the point serious risk) for brothers and pledges only, I did what they expected of me and well... consumed copious amounts of alcohol to the point of serious risk. For anonymity's sake I wont describe the event for privacy's sake but I was in and out of blacking out for a while until a certain point when I stopped remembering anything. Over the years, though, some things have come back to me as I've tried to process this experience. I have flashes of being turned over and someone holding my head so I throw up in a trash can and not myself or the chair I was on. There's a slide show of me fall-walking down half the stairs. One of the last things I remember is asking to stay the night in one of the brother's rooms because I knew, somehow, that I was ridiculously drunk didn't want to get caught when going back to mine. He said no. He was my closest friend there. It should have been clear to anyone around that I wasn't safe but these guys were still giving me shitty light beer instead of water because ""it's basically the same thing."" I'll never get that line, or the laughter that followed, out of my head.

Instead of getting me help, or even just letting me stay there, one of the brothers just took my back to my dorm. Luckily for me, an RA saw me being brought in essentially over his shoulder and felt like I was in danger so she called for help. Even after all these years, the last thing I remember from that night is answering a knock at the door of my dorm. When I woke up in the hospital the next morning I was told that I could have died. They described how I acted and it was clear to me after just hearing about it that I was in danger. My BAC (blood alcohol concentration) was at .37 and there was somehow still more in my stomach that I hadn't thrown up before they pumped it. For reference, alcohol poisoning can cause death and generally shows up around .30 while .40 is potentially fatal on it's own because your heart or lungs can just stop working.  My RA almost certainly saved my life.

When I was sitting in that hospital bed, I cried. Not because I might have died but because I felt like my life that I was just getting back had fallen apart again. I felt broken, betrayed, and profoundly sad that the people I trusted didn't care enough about me to try and keep me alive. When I got back to campus I had to meet with a disciplinary officer because of underage drinking and he questioned where I got the alcohol, who I was with, etc., but apart from that I just followed my usual routine that I was accustomed to. It was the weekend, so I went down to the frat house. I still don't know why, really... I think I was just numb and going through the motions or maybe I wanted a sense of normalcy. When I got there, all the feelings of sadness turned to anger. As I told them what happened, the people that I halfheartedly expected to be happy to see me were more concerned about what I might have said to the disciplinary officer than the fact that I was alive. They were wrong to do that, for the record, because I covered their asses completely. But I was livid. These people were supposed to be my brothers. How dare they leave me for dead? How dare they feign concern for me when all they really want is to protect themselves?

I made an excuse, that I had just wanted to update them but was tired and still recovering, so that I could go back to my dorm. I stewed in anger and resentment for hours. I thought about all the things I had experienced, all the warning signs, and I made a plan. First, I set up a new email account and got the faculty email for the head of the disciplinary committee (calling him CommitteeHead now, full title is annoying to type out every time), a guy who apparently *really* hated the presence of fraternities on campus housing. I told him I was a student who had information about crimes committed by the members of this particular fraternity and wanted them gone, not just from their house but from the school. I also talked to one of the girls who took me aside in my dorm, one I felt I could trust, and asked if she or anyone she knew had experiences, names, anything. She wasn't willing to step forward personally but she knew someone who was and helped me get in touch.

Three days later, I met with the CommitteeHead at 4am in someone else's office. I didn't want to be seen because I didn't want anyone to know what was going on or have any heads up. I asked him what he needed to take their house, and he told me. He amended the report I gave to the original disciplinary officer to include two ""accidental"" mentions of a particular relatively uncommon alcohol, one this fraternity always uses for their traditional, stupid, ritualistic, fraternity-only drinking events. For what it's worth, that alcohol was actually present so it wasn't exactly a lie. Apparently just that much was enough for an investigation and wouldn't need me to be involved any more than I already was, which was something I insisted on. The investigation merely being opened was also enough that one anonymous tip-off, say, where certain quantities of certain drugs were likely to be hidden within the frat house, was also enough for campus police to come knocking with real police in tow to tear the place apart if enough was found the first time. Remember, the house is owned by the school so as long as the school gives the police permission to search and they have enough reason to, they're good to go.

I also got him in contact with the brave girl who was willing to come forward with her story. I don't know if she ever got real justice, but I do know that one member of the frat suddenly dropped out between the first time I met with the CommitteeHead and when the police came. I hope she did. I made myself scarce around the frat house for a month or so with the excuse that I needed to stop drinking. I didn't stop, at least at that point, but I needed some reason for my distance. Even though I wasn't around as often as I once was, I did spend enough time there to put various amounts of coke, xanax, MDMA, ket, and LSD in places that people wouldn't look until the time was right. I've never been a rich guy so it wasn't much, but pretty much every other room had enough for a minor possession charge thanks to my generosity. When the house eventually got flipped and the drugs were found I dropped out because despite my best attempts to hide it, at that point most of the brothers were keeping me at arms length and looking at me with suspicion. It was near the end of the semester anyway and I had gone from doing fairly well in my first semester to failing most of my classes in the second, so I thought it was probably for the best. I still got to see some of them get dragged out of the house in handcuffs. It was worth it.

When it was all said and done, the frat house was essentially raided twice, at least 3 of the brothers dropped out while facing serious possession charges (that I had nothing to do with, those were their drugs) and the rest of them had to separate, moving into other dorms or already scarce off-campus housing when the fraternity was banned by the school from ever having an official on-campus house for the next decade. Many of them also got minor possessions charges on their own or thanks to me. This was almost a decade ago now, and I don't regret it at all apart from the fact that I didn't do something sooner. Eventually I got help for my mental health and no longer abuse drugs or alcohol to cope with pain. I also transferred away from that shitty hellhole of a school with just the one good semester on my transcript, though I never did get around to finishing my degree because I spent years in a self-destructive spiral and all my money on therapy to pull myself out. I just hope what I did made it at least slightly less likely for others to be in danger, one way or another, and that all the people who deserved it got what was coming to them. The pessimist in me doubts it, but I like to think that they did. At the very least, I know that fraternity doesn't have any presence at my former school anymore. Seems like it's kind of hard to get new recruits when you lose the only thing you had going for you and your already shitty reputation gets worse.

TL;DR Joined a fraternity looking for friendship, got used to keep their on-campus housing and left for dead with serious alcohol poisoning. Frat was more concerned with getting in trouble than the fact that I almost died- in part because of them- so I colluded with and then tipped off the head of the campus disciplinary committee, leading to their house being shut down and some of them facing serious time for drug possession.",1846,0.95,110,13Petrichor,2022-12-23 20:44:59,ztzrh4,1956,High
NuclearRevenge,"Guy behind me in traffic was blinding me in traffic with his high-beams, so i violated his retinas with the full force of an afternoon sun","I was driving home from work and traffic was backed up pretty badly for a few miles. It was stop and go. When i get stuck in that, i'll usually back about 75 feet off the car in front of me so that i can hold a pace and move at a slow, but constant roll - like the semi trucks do. This way im not participating in the bumper to bumper move and brake like the rest of the smooth brain drivers. 

Some dude in an Acura Crossover was behind me, and i guess he was getting upset because i wasn't 2 feet from the car in front of me, driving like a smoothbrain. So he gets up on my butt and starts beeping his horn at me. ""Lol"" i think to myself as i turn up my radio. 

But then he starts flashing his brights at me, which is where i get annoyed. He's in one of those acuras that has the super bright LED headlights. My car is much lower than his, so his low beams are already pretty bright in my mirrors. Bright enough that i dont want to look in them. The first time he flashed his highbeams it put spots in my vision for a moment. It genuinely hurt my eyes. After the first flash, he waits for about 10 seconds, beeps his horn, and then flashes me again. Now im getting pissed. Im thinking ""where the fuck do you want me to go? Do you really think being two feet from the car in front of you will make traffic move faster?"" Then he flashes me a third time, but this time he held them on for about 15 seconds. Time for the gloves to come off. 

During those 15 seconds, as im looking away from my mirrors, i see my 14,000 lumen searchlight sitting in my passenger seat, at which point I'm immediately overcome by a wave of chaotic-lawful excitement, what he has just set in motion can not be stopped. I think to my self ""oh buddy....you just opened the wrongggg can of worms. You're gonna learn today"" 

I grab the flashlight and set it to its absolute max 14,000 lumen brightness setting. The flashlight has a sensor in it to automatically dim the light if facing down on a table, because otherwise the diodes would get so hot they would melt the lense.The 14,000 lumen setting is so intense, the 57 watt-hour battery can only hold it for 180 seconds before the flashlight automatically notches down to a measly 9,500 lumens. During those 180 seconds, the light will burn through 15% of it's battery power. For reference on just how bright this is, *the literal fucking sun* emits a luminosity of 11,000 lumens per square foot on a bright and clear day. 

I turn around and aim it straight out the back of my rear window. My car is pretty noisy, so before i turn it on, I rev up my engine to make sure captain smoothbrain is eyes forward when I violate his retinas with the full force of an afternoon sun. I hit the power button and can only imagine the freight train of shock and pain that plowed over this man. It was so bright, his automatic headlights shut off because the car thought it was daytime. With the light on, i could see him clear as glass through his tinted windshield, he was covering his eyes and looking down. Probably screaming. I watched him try and flip down his sun visor, but his hand couldn't find it, as i thought to myself ""Burn you motherfucker....burn"". I imagine my facial expression was similar to that of a 6 year old roasting insects with a magifying glass on a bright summer day. After about 5 seconds of blinding light, i took mercy and shut it off. He proceeded to back way the hell off, and move over to a different lane. 

Was this an unsafe thing for me to do? Absolutely. Was this illegal? Almost certainly. Was it warranted? Without question. Possibly the highlight of my year

Drive safe, and dont be a dick to the car in front of you. Because they might just have the tools to teach you a lesson. 

TLDR: Dickhead in traffic was excessively flashing his highbeams at me, hurting my eyes, because I couldn't go faster than the car in front of me - so I showed him how it feels.

NuclearRevenge,One Too Many Times,"When I was younger especially throughout middle school I dealt with bullying and toxicity constantly. I've never been much of a reddit user but I decided to post my story after watching some of these on YouTube. This situation happend when I was in 7th grade. During that time I was progressively bullied by a group of kids I will call the Goonies. 

I'm not a small person and I never have been around that time I was around 5'11 150 lb. Although I'm big for my age I've never been one to fight back, I have impulse control issues and adhd so when I get worked up I have a hard time calming down or I got overboard. Even so I can mostly hold back my emotions when on medication.

The goonies, the group of kids who constantly made my life hard throughout my school experience. the group comprised of 5-6 kids mostly small and on the football team but due to their numbers they had an advantage over most people in my school. They preyed consistent on people who were without a group. Most of the time they just took food items during lunch and asked for money from others. On the bad days they would fight others and take whatever they wanted.

They had been preying on me and my group of friends for a while mostly talking shit and taking food. This time was different though, I had worn my grandfather's chain and cross to school I had gotten as inheritance when he passed the week before. When I tell you it meant alot to me it did. My grandfather was my pride and joy we had the best relationship as my father was mostly out of town working. He has never been in the best health but he got lung cancer a few months before and passed on. The chain was all I really had besides some model train sets and a ukulele. That day I wore my chain to remove some of the grief I was feeling from his passing to make it through the day.

My friends knew about the passing and were trying to comfort me throughout the day. But the one class I don't have with them was gym and in our school we are required to remove jewelry before class. That part was uneventful the problem was when I went back into the locker room. All of the goons had gym the period after and I would see them as I was in the locker room. As I walked in and took my chain out of my locker one of them took notice and immediately asked what i had in my hand. I of course wanting not to cause problems said nothing important.

 I went to the bathroom to put it on and when I walked out all of them were waiting for me. They started to tell me to give them what was around my neck. In the moment I was on the verge of tears because I didn't want to lose one of the only things I had left to remember my grandfather.  So i made made a run for it. They blocked to door and started punching and kicking me I didn't want to cause a fight because I knew it would get out of hand and I up until then had a perfect school record.

 When they stopped I sat up and started to try and leave. The main goonie the leader of the pack grabbed the chain and ripped it of me breaking it and mangling the cross that my grandfather took such pride in. He started laughing as I stared at him in pure disbelief. 

I Saw Red. I lost it and started pummeling the main kid grabbing him by his collar and smashing his head over and over again into the concrete while his friends watched screaming to stop trying to pry me away. The gym teacher heard all of the commotion (I don't know how he didn't hear me getting jumped before) and came in running, yanking me away from main goon and locking me in his office.

 He called the nurse and an ambulance, he was freaking out. I got suspended for 3 months only due to Camaras in the hall that could see into the window of the door. It witnessed them jumping me. The only reason I didn't get arrested was that Camara thank God for technology.

This might not seem like nuclear revenge yet but here's the list you are waiting for. 

INJURIES: Fractured skull, broken nose, broken jaw, 8 lost teeth, and severe brain damage. He was out for 4 months with some time in the hospital. He didn't make it back onto the football team due to the fear his head would get hit. His grades also took a hit and he had to repeat 2 years. 

My group on the other hand have been free from bullying ever since. 

So what do you guys think. Did I take it to Far or was it deserved. Let me know in the comments.",2327,0.97,282,ThoseWeebs,2022-12-15 22:34:43,zn63n8,2609,High
NuclearRevenge,My ex started abusing me again. I ruined her college education.,"I (21M) met my ex girlfriend Renae (fake name) (20f) 4 years ago when we were 17 and 16 in specific. We were off and on because of her behavior and mine as well. It was toxic and we weren't best suited. I was untrusting and cold some days. She was always drinking and going out with other people and couldn't be bothered with me unless she had a bad day. 

She constantly went out drinking, sending explicit pics to other guys. Having sex and then blaming it on assault so I wouldn't freak out. And I handled it poorly by being strict and creating rules and being way too overprotective of her. Which I can admit is my bad. But she always made me the source of her issues and blamed me for her parents hating her. Her sister being mean to her. Not having a social life. Even thought I stopped her from suicide when I met her, helped her finish high school, and helped her get a scholarship to my local university. 

We finally broke up when she moved here for college from a few states away almost 2 years ago. When she at 19 started dating a minor behind my back. I went on with my life and she went on with hers. I met somebody and we had a perfectly healthy relationship and she brought out the best in me and made me become a better person until a month ago when I lost her to complications in her life and she had to leave. I grieved as I needed and continued trying to do better like she always wanted for me. 

Flash forward a week ago when Renae and I ran into eachother and stated talking again, told her how my life was going, she talked about hers. And we started being friends again. She knew I was grieving and at first was incredibly sympathetic and I figured we could have a good friendship. After a day she started comparing me to her new boyfriend (21m) and making fun of me for things I lacked and would rub in my face how better he is at everything compared to me. 

The shoe dropped when she started rubbing in my face about having sex with him and how it must suck knowing I can't again with my ex. I'm fine with being insulted but bringing her up knowing my pain pushed a line. I told her to knock it off and don't talk about it and she proceeded to treat me like a client at her job (she helps mentally disabled people and knows I have a slight disability) and kept telling me that if I don't wanna be talked to like that then stop telling her what to do. 

She gets drunk one night and starts yelling at me about our relationship and all the issues she endured for being with me. I apologized and made my amends because I can agree I wasn't always the best. Never expected her to apologize for hers but made clear how sorry I was for my part as I know I wasn't always correct, and she finally went to bed.

Next night she calls me at 1AM, She gets incredibly drunk. Starts calling me names and saying I'm mean because she's bringing up sex with her bf and how she's doing it while texting to me and I get sick of it and tell her to go away. She makes comments she's gonna keep screwing him, to where I make a comment of ""that's nice, now if only he could satisfy,"" which brought her boyfriend into a rage and threatening to shoot me, and then renae pipes up and says she should go find my ex and tell her how horrible I used to be and ruin everything so if the day comes where she can come back, she will never want to see me again. 

Cue my nuclear revenge. They both were college students living in the dorm on scholarships, the college has a rule against alcohol and you will lose your scholarship if caught with it. So I contacted the police, gave them her dorm number, explained she's underage drinking, her boyfriend is supplying the alcohol, and she's currently having sex in the dorm with him. Police show up, dorm roommates let them in, knock on the door catch her drunk with all sorts of alcohol from over state lines (my state has a lesser alcohol rating so stuff from the next state over is double in alc percentage) and catch them both obviously having sex while she's drunk. 

She ends up charged with underage drinking, he's charged with giving alcohol to a minor and is looking at added sexual assault charges because he got her drunk and then screwed her while she's under the legal age. And both of their scholarships were lost and were expelled and now both have to leave town and they both live in entirely different states. 

She wants to make me feel lesser? Enjoy losing your education.

Edit: Apologies for some of the poor writing, English isn't my first language so I had to reword a few things with help from a dictionary.

UPDATE: I ended up talking with her roommate on campus. The assault charges didn't stick because she said it was consensual before drinking. I'm at least glad they check on stuff like that in case it is not. Her parents came down and grabbed her things with her and left. Her roommate didn't like the bf anyways. She said because he was just an asshole to everybody but Renae. Didn't tell her it was me who called campus police, but I'm sure they know who called. Renae and her bf are still together, just living back at home till they figure something out. To be fair her boyfriend threatened physical harm to me. And she insulted me multiple times. At least on the bright side he's too far away to hurt me now. Do I think I was nuclear on this? Yes. Do I feel bad? A little bit, I can definitely see the immaturity and people's comments and understand where I need to improve as a person. 

FAQ: How could police come in without there being justifiable cause?
A: campus has its own police department and if there's anything that breaks dorm rules the R.A has all dorm keys and can let them in. They've come in my exes dorm for a roommate on suspection of hiding alcohol and they're permitted to search because they're on campus property. 

Q: Why would you even talk to her again?/Not block her?
A: I haven't seen her in over a year, I changed a lot since then, I felt she deserved the right to have a chance as well. She was really nice at first. But obviously I forgot who I was dealing with. Losing somebody and the isolation from it and grieving didn't put me in the best place. I expected some hard feelings to work through. Not that. 

Q: Why would they even consider assault charges?
A: Older guy gives girl under the legal age of alcohol consumption a mind altering substance and has sex with her. Our campus has a problem with that. 

Q: How is 20 underage?
A: underage drinking is considered anybody under the age of 21 here.",2921,0.93,178,DontCallMeAt1AMDrunk,2022-12-14 13:57:31,zm0jv7,3099,High
NuclearRevenge,Two for the Price of One,"So I was laid off. No big deal, right? It happens. But in this instance, it's a little different. 

I was working at a tech startup and was one of the early employees. I was one of the key people to develop their technology, which significantly helped enable them to raise tens of millions of dollars. I was told early on that they would basically take care of me as the company grew.

Well, for a time at least, the company grew leaps and bounds. Again, much in part to the excellent tech I helped develop. Yet, the company had little concern for little ol' me. Meanwhile, they brought on a bevy of new managers and high-level people, and yet my career was basically stagnant while I was there.

But then, things started to slow down due to economic conditions. There had been a couple of layoffs, and I figured it was probably time to leave the sinking ship. So I lined up a new position at another company. I then went into my manager and told him that it seemed like more layoffs were imminent and that I had secured a job offer at another company. I asked him if it would be a good idea if I should take it, and he said that he would let me know. A couple of days later, after he had discussed things with the CEO, they said I was OK and not to take the other position.

I turned down the other position, because I had invested so much of myself into this company (even having sold my house and moved hundreds of miles to work at this company) and I still had a lot of stock options that I was hoping would be worth something some day.

Literally a couple of weeks later, guess what? Yep, they laid me off. Now that other position was no longer available, and because this was at the height of the recession, I was out of work for four months until I found another position. I could have even lost my house during this time, and I had to sell some cool stuff to keep paying the bills. The new position I finally found was much further from home and was a financial hardship. I would have been better off if they had just been honest with me and told me to take the offer I had in hand previously.  But honesty wasn't ever their policy.

Anyhow, before I was involuntarily separated from the company, I was working with a fortune 500 company that was trying to partner with us on some technology. After leaving, I got wind that they were going to invest $15 million dollars in the company. That bothered me for several reasons, mostly because most of us were pretty sure that the crooked CEO was pilfering the company for personal gain. I'm thinking that this guy shouldn't be rewarded for his atrocious management of the company, and honestly, I didn't think that it would be a wise investment for this large company.

I contacted my inside guy at the fortune 500 and told him some of my concerns about the stewardship of the money at the startup and that it wasn't really a wise investment. This company was looking for a distribution deal for our technology, so I told them the best use of their money would be to make a deal to exchange a large blanket purchase order for stock. This way, the startup company would still get a big chunk of investment money coming in, but they would have to perform for it. It's the difference between giving a kid an allowance for no reason at all, or giving a kid an allowance based on if they did their chores or not.

I didn't necessarily want the investors to walk away from a partnership, because I had many friends still at the company and didn't want to see them out in the cold. So my thought was that this type of a deal would keep the company afloat while minimizing the potential for pilfering and better protecting the investment. All in all, if structured right, it could be a win/win, and make it much more difficult for the crooked CEO and his cronies to loot the company.

I additionally told them that I wouldn't recommend investing a penny unless they got a seat on the Board of Directors. That way, they would have first-hand knowledge of some of the shenanigans going on behind the scenes with their money.

That was about it. Now they were armed with some additional information and tactics to perhaps better protect their investment as well as help ensure that if they did invest, everything would be above board.

Sometime later, I heard that the CEO pulled the entire company into the conference room and chewed them a new one. He was furious, because the investor had somewhat done what I had suggested. They had dropped their investment from 15 million to 5 million dollars and had come up with some sort of blanket order or something along those lines.  I'm not quite sure, but in essence it meant a $10 million loss in the mind of the CEO.  He's a bit of a fat slob, so it's quite unfortunate that he didn't just have a heart attack right then and there.

No surprising, in the process the investor was denied the board seat, and one can only guess why, dirty secrets and all. In fact, one of the board members that the CEO did bring on board had already done time for defrauding his clients. A marriage made in heaven, I guess.

So, not necessarily meant as revenge, but sweet nonetheless, the company basically lost $10 million dollars because of what they did to me. They were all but expecting this money. Had they not laid me off, I probably wouldn't have even thought about putting the investors interests above that of the corrupt company.

In the end, surprising to no one, the investor eventually got majorly screwed by the unscrupulous startup company anyways. The two companies had some disagreements about their distribution agreement and the investor ended up having to pay a major settlement to the startup company after a contentious mediation.

But, never fear, don't screw with a fortune 500.

As the startup company was starting to gasp it's last breath, they were working on a promising deal with another company they had identified as a major potential customer, one that would put them back on the track to financial success and further line the CEO's dirty pockets. Well, the fortune 500 company got wind of the deal, bought the other company, and then shut down the deal!  That's ninja-level revenge!

So in the end, two nuclear revenges for the price of one!!  I couldn't have been happier to hear about the karmic justice once again hitting the company.

Now the company is all but dead. All physical assets went to auction.  The CEO is milking the last few dollars out of the account, but because our SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) is all but worthless, he'll start another venture and the cycle will repeat itself.  The sad thing is that the CEO, in my humble opinion, makes Elizabeth Holmes (the CEO of Theranos) look like Mother Theresa. I pray that one day they do a Netflix docuseries exposing all that went on at this mess of a company. I can guarantee you, it will be quite a hit.",1786,0.95,55,golthingdan,2022-12-12 17:35:23,zkfkqf,1841,High
NuclearRevenge,Don't Mess With Southerners,"Ok, so before I start I want to first say: I cannot attest to the validity of this story. It isn't mine, but a story a friend's great grandfather told them when they were younger, and from what I've heard the man wasn't all there towards the end. My friend told me this story and I thought it'd fit here.

So, back when my friend's GGF was in his early 20s he had been very close with this one family. They were described to me as a family of swamp people, but Floridian. There was the Grandfather, father, mother, uncle, two daughters, and three brothers that lived in this little trailer park in the woods. They kept to themselves and didn't bother anyone. GGF only knew them because he had met the youngest daughter while in school and were dating. 

He got a job from the Grandfather and was kinda absorbed into the family. He worked in their bait shop with the uncle, and life went on. Well, one day the eldest daughter went to a party some local boys were throwing and dragged her sister along. GGF and uncle were at the bait shop, mother and father was at home, no one knew where the three brothers were, and grandfather was on the couch napping his sixth beer away.

During the party the two sisters split apart and the younger one ended up getting pulled away by two guys. They did ""You know what"" and then ran when the older sister found them. News got back to the family quick and as my friend put it ""The brother miraculously materialized and the old man rose."" For the next week the men of the family searched for those boys and found them. They weren't locals and we're visiting family, but the men broke into their home beat them up, tied them up, and took them deep into the glades.

In the glades grandfather handed GGF a revolver and said ""She's your woman"", so GGF took the gun. He thought about just shooting them dead then and there, but instead shot them each in one leg and told them ""If you find your way back I guess I'll forgive you.""

Then they left. Those guys were never heard from again. Never came out of the glades and their truck was later sold to a neighbor by family members. My friend told me he asked why his GGF didn't just shoot them and he said ""I wanted to see if God would forgive them, because I wouldn't.""

Personally I interpreted that to mean God showed them mercy by letting them die in the swamp instead of by the hands of GGF. Until my friend told me that story I didn't thing Florida had Mafia type shit like that.",847,0.96,107,D-MoTheWiz,2022-12-12 19:15:21,zkhzno,954,High
NuclearRevenge,Use me? Cheat on me? Enjoy losing your friends and family and have fun being ignored at work. Bonus points for possibly become homeless,"
I just found out 2 days ago that my boyfriend of 4 years is gay. Our relationship was a lie. He used me to cover his sexuality because he wasn't ready to expose himself (he told me that himself). He pretended to love me for 4 years. He acted like the perfect boyfriend for 4 years. We were discussing marriage and kids. He even took me to looking at engagement rings..... All while he was having an affair with a man.

To top all that, his boy toy called me 2 hours after i walked in on them. Why? To tell me that he was bi and we could all just be together... Are you kidding me? Idk he was making fun of me or if he was really stupid enough to think that was a good idea. But yeah.

If you're gay but act straight i f'ing hate you. 

What's worse is that my family believes i should have been nicer to him because ""gay people have it rough enough already"". So because he's gay then i can't be mad? I can't be angry? I need to be nicer? To him?

After his boy toy called i texted my now ex if he was seriously making fun of me and he just said that it wouldn't be a bad idea. So i lost it. His mom and i were very close so i texted her a lengthy message explaining what happened and i told her that i can't stay in contact with her at least not for the time being. She was shocked but understanding of why i need to go NC. 

Well, his parents disowned him. Not for being gay but because of what he did to me.

The idiot went on social media to complain that his parents disowned him for being gay but multiple family members commented and exposed him for the shitty human being that he is.
Some of his co workers had him on fb and Tik Tok and they saw everything and now no one at work talks to him because of what he did to me.

His friends were disgusted when they found out. His friends always liked me and they're also really big on monogamy so they didn't want to be friends after they learned the truth.

He needs to move out because we lived together and now he can't afford rent on his own but his budget is very tight so he doesn't have many options.

 AND!  They broke up. My ex had a fit when his mom called him. In retaliation he broke the TV, my laptop, cut some of the clothes i still had at the apartment and smashed the coffee machine. So yeah, his boyfriend didn't like his outburst and he ended things.


Edit: Yes, i am sueing him for the damages

Update:
I want to start by saying i wrote this post in a state of anger and i was too emotional to realize how bad it sounded. I do not hate gay people. I have no problems with the community. I'm sorry if i came off as a homophobic bitch. I really am not. I was just emotional so i will like to apologize. I understand the community is going thru a lot and i didn't want to come out as insensitive. So I'm sorry.

Now the actual update.
I received some comments and PMs from people that advised me to get a restraining order and make sure he can't find me , i unfortunately didn't consider them enough and as some predicated he  followed me from my bff's place to the grocery store and he trashed my car. 
I'm talking slashed tires, broken widows and what i think it's oil all over my car. Thankfully the parking lot has cameras and the police identified him in no time. He was arrested. I am definitely filling for a restraining order and I'm looking to move to a different city. 
I will have to see him again in the court room tho. Also, his ex boy toy agreed to testify that he witness my ex breaking my things at the apartment. My ex is also going to be examined by a professional due to his actions it appears he may be suffering from some mental illnesses.
I've contacted his parents and they are in shock but they still refuse to have any contact with him.

Edit: Please stop asking me if I'm looking for a new boyfriend",3717,0.93,207,[deleted],2022-12-07 09:31:59,zf3za4,3924,High
NuclearRevenge,Haribo revenge goes way farther than intended,"TL;DR: Guy bullies the shit out of kid, kid feeds him Haribo sugar free bears, and kid is violently intolerant of sugar substitutes, shits blood and busts blood vessels in eye, goes blind in that eye.


I was a witness to this, a long time ago, and the results were learned of by word of mouth. 


Once upon a time, there was a kid. Let's call him Marco. Marco was your everyday kid, a little skinny. I remember him being slightly geeky. If you left your pens unattended, he'd disassemble them before you turned back around in your seat at times. He was nice, polite, and fairly helpful. This was middle school. One day, though, he does it to a bully. Let's call him Polo. Polo is huge, but with fat. He looks like if you drilled three holes into him, a giant could use him for bowling. He's not nice. He's not handsome. He's got a posse of equally disgusting friends who all gang up together to bully others. I suspect that if they hadn't ganged up with each other, they would have been bullied. Perhaps they had been in the past, and got a taste of power over others when they ganged up. I don't know, I kept to myself. 


One day, I see Marco with a swollen eye and wet hair. He's limping a bit too, and his backpack is ripped. I ask him what the hell happened. Turns out Polo threw him into a bathroom stall by his backpack, which ripped. The toilet got him in the knee, and Polo shoved his face into the water, bashing his eye into the seat. I ask why Polo had done this to him and he says I took his pen apart. It was just a BIC Cristal or some cheap pen like that. Things escalate over the next few weeks. Eventually, Marco has to take time off when Polo strips him naked in the bathroom except for his boxers and makes him shove them into the toilets. The school, being full of your typical assholes, tries to expel Marco for damage to school property, and does nothing to Polo. This is stopped by video evidence of the gang leaving the bathroom, laughing and rifling through Marco's backpack, then tossing it in the trash. 


When Marco comes back, he's different. He's not happy. He's quiet, subdued. He doesn't talk to anyone, and bruises magically appear on him between classes. He withdraws into himself and begins to look positively skeletal. Of course, no one at the school does anything, except the one nice jock. He comes across Polo stealing Marco's backpack and folds Polo into a trash can. Of course, he's suspended, but does it again when he comes back. The teachers give up on suspending the jock after his parents threaten to sue. 


The fact that someone bothered to stand up for him, though, seems to have given life back to Marco. He starts opening back up and putting weight back on, which is very good. One day, though, he's wearing a scarf. A very special, beautiful knitted scarf. His grandfather had knit it for him (yes, grandfather) before he died. Polo steals it and comes back the next day with a bag of ashes, handing it to Marco. He laughs hysterically. 


Marco comes back the next day with a backpack full of sugar free Haribo gummy bears. Polo, being the glutton that he is, steals every single bag of bears and eats them by the fistful throughout the day. Marco cries, but I remember something in his sobs didn't quite reach his eyes. Near the end of the school day, Polo lurches out of the classroom and bolts for the bathroom. He doesn't come back the next day. Or the next. Someone says they saw blood in the bathroom. 


Polo comes back a few days later with an eye patch and mottled, fading bruising all across his face (I believe it's called petechiae). He's permanently blind in his left eye and the bruising makes him look like a ripening fruit for as long as it lasts. He's in and out of school for doctor's appointments for a while. He didn't mess with Marco again and instead became very introverted and quiet. The reports of blood in the toilet of the bathroom he went to were never confirmed, but it's quite likely.",2860,0.97,221,_SCP_682_,2022-12-02 08:35:53,zanul9,3081,High
NuclearRevenge,"Cheating ex flaunts side chick, loses his job and she gets graduation dress burned into oblivion","This happened almost 10 yrs ago, so even if dots get connected, I know I'm safe as per our laws. This didn't actually happen to me, but I executed the revenge. **TL;DR at the end.**

My last year of middle school I introduced my best friend, whom I'm gonna call **Lily**, to one of my Arts classmates, who I'm gonna call **Shitty**. They dated for around 7 yrs, all through high school and Uni, until she found right after graduation Shitty'd been cheating on her with his classmate from Uni, **CattyCat**.

Lily and Shitty took language lessons at a small school next to a big shopping mall, and after their breakup I went with her there so she could cancel her classes. I'd been giving her grand speeches about how **life would take care of teaching the guy a lesson**, all this crap. After being done with cancellation fees, papers and all we went into the mall for a feel-better dessert, and guess who was there at the food court? Shitty, who spotted me and Lily right away, and CattyCat, who looked as white as a ghost.

Shitty literally dragged CattyCat towards us, who were both frozen because *can you believe it*? And forced CattyCat - who clearly wanted to be *anywhere* but there - to greet Lily, and asked Lily ""are you not gonna talk to me?"" all the while with a disgusting grin. I pulled Lily from there without a word, we left the mall, walked to the bus stop, all in silence. After I had digested what had just happened, I told Lily **""You know what I said about life? Forget it, it's gonna take too long.""**

I know what I did afterwards was illegal, and only later would I realize how catastrophic it could have been.Lily still had all of Shitty's passwords: bank account, email, cellphone etc, and he had hers. As soon as we got home (she'd been staying with me since the breakup), I made her change all her passwords, and asked her for his email's. That's all I wanted.

In our country, WhatsApp is the most used social media, and we often set it to backup daily into our Google Drive or Gmail. Shitty had his backup on Gmail. I skimmed through 2 yrs worth of conversation with CattyCat, complete with pics and audio files, and screenshot/cropped out the most interesting parts (such as them talking about sex in the restrooms and emergency exit at Shitty's work DURING his shift, bragging about how they blinded their SO's to have their escapades - turns out CattyCat was MARRIED).  
Now, I was going to send the Clippings of Doom to Shitty's family (he was their ""golden boy""), but I got a better idea after learning how bad they had fucked up. So I tracked down Shitty's boss on LinkedIn, got his work email, found CattyCat's husband on FB and (using a throw-away account) sent them the bomb. Heard through the grapevine Shitty got fired, but cried (literally) for a second chance, and was on ""probation"" at work - one more fuck up and buh-bye. Not the outcome that I wanted, but meh.

Fast forward a few months, I was talking to my cousin and she was telling me about how her fiancé's colleague was traveling all over the world, and he recently posted some pictures at a bar made of ice, and she wanted to travel there too. She showed me the picture the guy had posted. Lo and behold, traveling colleague was CattyCat's ex husband, Rick.

I asked her how she knew Rick, and she told me he was her fiancé's friend and work colleague. I didn't tell her about my shenanigans, only said Rick's ex wife and my best friend's ex had cheated on her, and inconspicuously (I hope) asked my cousin how Rick was, how it must've been a sad breake up for him, and DID SHE SPILL THE TEA.

So, CattyCat had introduced Rick to Shitty during her graduation ceremony a few weeks before I sent the bomb, saying ""look, this is the friend who helped me with my graduation project!"" - Rick had allowed Shitty and CattyCat to use his computer at home for said project, turns out they were fucking on his bed while he was working his ass off to pay for her sorry one, and she MADE HIM SHAKE HANDS with her lover.

Rick was a programmer, CattyCat was from the countryside, and she'd been living in the city with him for a few years. Rick had an awesome salary, he payed for everything so CattyCat could focus on Uni. But one day, he received some evidence his wife was cheating on him, WITH THE GUY he'd shaken hands, the same guy he alowed to use his computer, in his house, to help his wife do her graduation project.  
Rick got her graduation dress, set in on fire, shoved her into the car, drove all the way to her family's home in the countryside, (reportedly) dragged her into her parent's house by the hair, made her kneel and tell her mother and father what she'd been doing. Her father was so distressed, he had a minor stroke, and her mother kicked her out and cut her off from the family. As far as I know (last I checked was 5 years ago), they were still NC.  
Rick threw her out of his house, she moved in with Shitty's family, and Rick, now with his salary bitch-free, was living la vida loca going to ice bars in neighboring countries. And I was desperate.

Had Rick been 1% madder, he could have burned her ALONG with the dress. Her father could have died after my interference. I didn't calculate how Rick could react AT ALL.

I called Lily, told her all about it, lost my sleep over it for weeks, even considered confessing to what I did. Lily asked me to let it go, what was done was done, to take this as a lesson and let life run it's course the next time, as I'd initialy said it would.

I'm not proud of it, and even though I don't lose sleep over it anymore, I still feel somewhat guilty. Confessing here is kind of cathartic, though.

EDIT: Fixed some mistakes now that I've stopped shaking and am able to function again, hope now it's easier to understand (I rushed when wrote the first time round).  
**TL;DR:**  
Lily is my best friend, Shitty is her ex.  
CattyCat was his side chick, Rick was her husband.  
CattyCat introduced husband to lover on her Grad ceremony, they shook hands.Shitty forced an encounter between Lily and CattyCat AFTER the breakup.  
I sent Shitty's boss and Rick evidence of what was going on. Shitty lost his job, Rick divorced CattyCat after burning her graduation dress and making her tell her parents why they were getting divorced.",2776,0.96,110,Prestigious_Smell539,2022-11-29 21:20:37,z8fo9c,2886,High
NuclearRevenge,Fourth Cakeday of r/Nuclearrevenge,"Hello Reddit. It has been four years since this subreddit r/Nuclearrevenge was born. Despite seeing some ups and downs and long periods of post droughts, there certainly were interesting moments that I plan to share with y’all.

> Third Cakeday of r/Nuclearrevenge - November 27, 2021

As it says on the tin, lads. The three year anniversary of the sub had come in, and thus I produced this post to celebrate it. Despite the fact it got much less traction and had much less events than usual, it was a neat moment and I got a Gold Award. Anyways…

> Voting Story of the Year - December 31, 2021

At the Eve of 2022, a third vote for Story of the Year was held. This time around, instead of having the best story of every month, the choices were between the top five posts through the whole year. And three days later…

> Story of 2021 - January 3, 2022

[This unrivaled masterpiece](https://www.reddit.com/r/NuclearRevenge/comments/kssykv/how_i_got_a_not_really_an_hoa_disbanded_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) was voted the story of 2021. Counting eight different parts, two separate posts and hundreds of awards, it is a colossus of epic. 

I swore that I would read it someday and that someday is still in the future. I’ll read it sometime during Christmas I swear.

> Announcement on Bad Stories - May 10, 2022

Our fellow mod u/claycam6 made a post on a recent trend of posts in which the receiver of the revenge seemed to have an ambiguous end, usually in the form of another friend’s hearsay.

> 400k Follower Milestone - May 21, 2022

This is so far our longest trek to the next milestone taking around two years (or a year and two months for ya pedants). It was a slow and sure road, but at the end we hit 400k. Rejoice.

> Prohibiting Murder Stories - May 22, 2022

Very creative subtitle, I know.

Following a meta post eight days earlier, Clay asked this community if we should prohibit murder stories. The overall consensus seemed to be that such stories were either fake, uninteresting, or did not fit the spirit of nuclear revenge.

> Prohibiting Revenge Porn Stories - September 14, 2022

As it says on the tin. 

Clay decided to ban revenge porn stories, though it is more of a *de facto* thing as it isn’t anywhere in the rule list just yet. Also worth mentioning is the revenge porn story that preceded this, which was such an unholy abomination of a deranged fantasy story that I need to summarize it here:

- OP is a teacher who has a troublesome student who leaves then comes back, pretending to be kind
- That student “confesses” her crush to OP who rejects her
- Later on, the OP gets fired and ostracized because that student sent porn of herself to OP, and OP also gets prison time
- Years later, OP is at a bar and sees the student bragging about what she did
- This infuriates OP to the point that he films her bragging for weeks, before sending the recordings to all of her relatives and puts it on a porn site
- The student gets arrested, shunned, ostracized, etc., while OP gets everything back and a reputation as a badass

Yeah. Good thing we won’t be seeing that anymore.

> Toilet Helmet - October 22-29, 2022

Shame I didn’t block this out of my memory.

So for about a week, there was a user sharing a story in which he had a coworker who pissed him off for reasons unknown, and got revenge by drenching his clothes in piss and feces for months on end. Somehow the coworker never figured it out.

As I was unnecessarily charitable, I only deleted the post instead of banning him. But he posted it again. And again, when I finally banned him. And then he reposted it with a two year old sleeper agent alt which I banned too. Then I cried to Clay who set up the AutoMod to instaban the story. And thus the saga ends.

> Fourth Cakeday of r/Nuclearrevenge - November 27, 2022

Voila.

Now, on to the random statistics and facts.

- Since the last cakeday, we gained around 60k members.
- Twenty one members were banned for varying reasons. Also two of those were the same guy, per the whole Toilet Helmet Saga.
- Between March 4 and April 16, there was a period where we had zero stories. An improvement from the previous year, I s’pose. 
- There was a significant spike in subs during February 28 when we got 2.2k subs in a day.
- The daily rise in subs has averaged around 150 members a day.


And that seems to cover it all. Rather short and uneventful, sure, but of the events that did happen, it was rather interesting. There were good stories and bad stories, period where there were no posts and ones that blew up, and I’m glad you were there to witness it. That’s all, and I’ll see you next year.

NuclearRevenge,Revenge and Roadkill: A Love Story,"TRIGGER WARNING: It's pretty gross. 

Long story ahead.

When I was a sophomore in high school, a new guy moved to town (Matt). Matt played guitar and I was a singer; our love was meant to be. We started dating when I was a junior and he was a senior (I was 16, he was 17). Honestly, it was a super cute romance that would probably make a decent Wattpad story, but it wasn’t meant to last as I was moving to a new state at the start of my senior year. This story takes place about 2 weeks before the end of my junior year and the school and town are getting ready for senior graduation. 

The characters (not real names):

OP (me, girlfriend)

Matt (boyfriend)

Griffin (bad friend)

Henry (good friend)

SDP (super dead possum) 

Jumping right in. 

Matt was my first everything. Losing my virginity wasn’t great but is it ever (for everyone’s sake, I hope that I’m wrong)? Matt and I were awkward but managed to talk boundaries before anything happened. In this conversation we agreed that it was really important to both of us that this stayed private, absolutely no bragging or being weird around friends. 

Griffin was a senior and someone who was in our group of friends but not a close friend. We were all in either orchestra, choir, and/or band. Everyone in those programs ran in the same social circle. Griffin was a Christian and it was a big part of his identity while we were at school. He had this like… charisma, or something, he used to invite classmates to his church while gently shaming all of us for not being exactly like him. Even though he was a bummer, his whatever-charisma kept him active in the social scene and he was at all of the major hangouts I can remember during that time. I was friendly with Griffin because to put it simply, I lacked confidence. I grew up in a church where I was taught that men were more important than me, to never question a man, my own mother shamed me for wearing my volleyball uniform at home because it was inappropriate and could confuse my brother. Fucked up doesn’t begin to cover that church or the amount I had to unlearn. 

By the time I was 17, I was fully done with church but still struggled with all I had been taught. It was a confusing time. Griffin knew this and his self-assigned senior project was getting me back to church. I’m 99% sure it was only about getting Matt involved because Griffin also wanted Matt to be a Christian but had so far been massively unsuccessful. Matt was not a Christian and had zero desire to know more. He saw firsthand how the church treated me and my family after some shit happened that was out of our control. Matt was not a fan. 

I kept a journal during that time in my life because if I didn’t, I’m sure I would have done something terrible to myself. My journal was plain, nothing on it to draw attention because I never wanted my family to think it was a journal. It was supposed to look like a school notebook. One day during lunch, I was at my usual table where Griffin sat. I realized I needed something from the choir room, so I left my stuff at the lunch table not thinking anything about leaving my backpack there. I had no idea anyone would go through my stuff because that had never happened before, and I didn’t have anything of value in there anyway. Well, as it turns out, my journal ends up being valuable because I had written about Matt and I. Griffin thought he had the ammunition to get me back into church and I'm assuming Matt was supposed to join us.

Griffin proceeded to take my journal and tell basically everyone in our social group, which led to most of the school knowing. A private moment became everyone’s, and it was fucking humiliating. Thankfully, Matt didn’t blame me even though I felt like it was all my fault. He was more confident than I was but also didn’t get nearly the same shame thrown his way that I was getting. I knew I was leaving in a few months, so I tried to keep my head down and focus on school but being called a whore, slut, etc. by people I grew up with… it grates on you after a while. I guess Griffin’s plan was to shame me back to church but instead all I wanted before leaving town was to ruin Griffin. It took some time but I got there.

Matt, Henry, and I were hanging out at my house after school. My house backed up to a street that often-had roadkill due to being right alongside a huge swath of woods. At this point, I knew that my revenge was going to include Griffin’s brand-new truck. This truck was literally all he could talk about because it was custom, his parent’s got it for him as an early graduation present, it was super expensive, it was perfect. Bottom line is he loved that truck more than anything he had ever had. I’m not a car person so I have no idea what the truck was or if it was good, but I do know it was really, really tall. Like you couldn’t see the top of it which ended up being bad for Griffin but fantastic for revenge.

There was a big, Super Dead Possum on the road behind my house that had been there for what seemed like a week, but I don’t remember how many days exactly. Normally the town was good about sending the guy down our road to pick up roadkill, so it had been there long enough for me to notice it which didn’t happen often. 

I was staring at the SDP because well, it was there. I’m staring, Matt starts staring, then Henry starts staring. We start talking about Griffin while we’re all staring at this disgusting pile. We’re talking and I’m getting mad, madder, then livid. However, I calm down when I realize we have an amazing opportunity in front of us.

Gentlemen, we’re going to bag that SDP and put it in Griffin’s truck. 

This wouldn’t be quite that simple so we start brainstorming how we can fully get away with this. Griffin lived in the area of town where it was faster for him to walk to school instead of drive (shortcut through the woods to the school meant a 3 min walk). Driving to school meant that he had to go 20 mph, or slower, and one of the cops was always out because of how the schools were placed so no speeding. Still took barely any time but it was a longer route than the shortcut. Griffin of course drove to school. We had a plan.

I snuck out that night, met Matt and Henry wearing all black and a mask, bagged up the SDP (the most disgusting thing I’ve ever done), and drove to Griffin’s. We parked a bit a way and went through the woods to the back of Griffin’s house, lugging this bag of putrid nonsense. This was before the time where a lot of people had cameras on their property, so we didn’t have to worry about anything besides floodlights on the side of the house. We had decided to put the SDP on top of the truck knowing that Griffin wouldn’t be able to see it, couldn’t drive like an asshole, and wouldn’t be taking his truck anywhere besides school.

Soooo, that SDP was fucking bloated and if any of you are at all familiar with bloated roadkill, you may know where this is going. SDP was heavy and not going anywhere until this revenge was done.

The next day at school, Griffin parks in the student lot like normal, we go to class like normal, I get called a few names throughout the day, and everyone is normal. I went through that day gleefully awaiting the final bell knowing Griffin was in for a nasty surprise. 

This is happening two weeks before graduation in a very southern state. It was hot as fuck where I grew up with 90% humidity on top of it. So, the bloated SDP on top of Griffin’s car? That SDP did what an old, bloated SDP is going to do which is… explode. If you’ve never experienced this smell, I hope you never do. 

The final bell rang. Matt, Henry, and I strategically placed ourselves a bit behind Griffin so we could see him once he got to his truck. When you made it to the parking lot, you made it to the smell. It was so horrible. People were gagging, frantically looking around trying to find the source while covering their noses and sprinting to their cars. I knew this plan was going to satisfy my revenge but never imagined this level of chaos. 

Griffin gets to his car and because the SDP exploded, he definitely notices it now. Also, his windows were cracked and all the \*ahem\* juice \*ahem\* seeped into the roof, down the windows, and the inside siding of the doors. There was no way he was driving home so he had to call a tow. Griffin started vomiting because he had stood to close to his truck for too long. Matt, Henry, and I were in the music programs and often stayed late so we stuck around for this whole fiasco, no one noticing us, and we get to see everything. Griffin manages to get on the phone calling his parents crying that his truck had been destroyed and we could hear his dad yelling from the speaker. Eventually the tow arrives, the guy gagging but gets the truck loaded up and out of the parking lot. At this point, Griffin had been yelling/crying/vomiting about his truck long enough that the people left at school knew what had happened and by the following morning, everyone knew. 

When Griffin came into school the next day, his parents and a guy in a suit were with him. A lot of people knew Matt and I had issues with Griffin. Matt was called to the principal’s office but never me. I’ll never know the exact reason for this, but it is most likely a combination of not having any physical evidence against Matt or myself and that no one imagined a woman would be involved in a retaliation scheme so disgusting. Griffin, his parents, and guy-in-suit tried to throw weight around to get some type of punishment for what happened but there wasn’t really anything the school could do to appease them without knowing who did it or having evidence that it happened at school. There were cameras at the school, and it was clear that Griffin arrived at school with the SDP already on his car. 

Everyone totally knew that Griffin’s car was destroyed by Matt, and probably me, but never Henry. No reason to suspect Henry. With no proof though, no one could actually say anything. After that day, people stopped calling me names and I was mostly ignored until I moved away. If people did have to talk to me, they were polite and to the point. I was told years later that people were genuinely terrified of Matt and I because plenty of shit had been said so everyone thought they were going to be next. The SDP was very effective. 

Pretty sure Griffin’s truck ended up entirely unusable, but I don’t know what they did with it. I only know that they spent a lot of time and a decent amount of money trying to get the smell out with no luck. Wouldn’t be surprised if every car detailing service within 100 miles was used. 

Griffin didn’t speak to Matt or me for the reminder of my time in that town. He stopped sitting with us, stopped going to events that we were at, and never invited us to church again. I was only around through the middle of summer, but it was long enough to witness a noticeable difference in Griffin’s behavior.

The graduation ceremony arrived and being a year younger, I was in the crowd cheering for my friends. This was completely unplanned but I get giddy picturing his face decades later. I managed to make eye contact with Griffin after he was done walking across the stage and quickly made an explosion motion with my hands and winked. He knew exactly what I meant.

NuclearRevenge,She cheated on me so i had a threesome with her former ex boyfriend and the guy she cheated on me with.,"to clear up any confusion that might come up you have to know that i am a bisexual man. i love sharing this story because i'm still proud of it.

a few years ago my ex girlfriend cheated on me with another guy. she then had the audacity to tell me that if i was a grown up that i could deal with it and that she hopes we can still be friends but she lost any feelings for me and is ""fully in love"" with this new guy now.

if she hadn't said that i probably wouldn't have made this plan. but now i had to teach her a valuable lesson. i was in a depressed state for a long time and couldn't bring myself to delete her number. and she thought i was her friend now. she started to send me pictures of her and her new boyfriend with laughing emojis. she didn't even care about how much she had hurt me.

and then one day while i went through tinder i found someone who was quite familiar. her new boyfriend. of course i wouldn't tell her that her new boyfriend is on tinder. in fact i matched with him, which was quite surprising because i thought he was straight and we started a conversation. he didn't knew who i was. she never told him she was in a relationship while she was flirting with him. but this was perfect. we had longer conversations and he told me more and more about him. over the weeks we learned more and more about each other and now i had a plan. i suggested that we could meet each other at a bar. he agreed. keep in mind he was still in a relationship with my ex girlfriend at that time.

when we met we had a great time. and one date became many dates. it took me few months but then i got him to the point where he developed feelings for me and i was his affair. what he didn't knew. i got in contact with my girlfriends former ex boyfriend as well. he broke up with her because he came out as gay. i was in contact with both guys. the ex boyfriend and i got along very well. in fact i made him a close friend of mine. in our conversations with my ""new boyfriend"" we talked about sexual desires and he told that he always wanted to have a threesome so i suggested one with the gay ex boyfriend. i knew that he was his type because we kinda look alike and he had feelings for me sooo. i asked the gay ex boyfriend if he wanted to become the third one and to my surprise he said yes.

i'm honestly still surprised how all of that worked out without her noticing but it did and then the day came where i decided to go nuclear. the two guys came to my apartment. i lead them to the bedroom and they started talking to each other. while they talked i took a selfie from a safe distance. close enough that she could see their faces but far enough that they wouldn't notice.

then the action started. of course i won't go into any detail but damn i enjoyed it more than anything in the world! a few days after this i told him that now that i granted him the wish of a threesome i wanted something in return. i told him that i don't wanna be an affair any longer and told him that he should either break up with her or i will break up with him. i knew it was hardcore manipulative but i had a plan and i had the full control over him. he actually broke up with her and threw her out. i even got him to move out of his apartment to move in with me. meaning that she lost both her home and her boyfriend. but i wasn't done yet.

because after that she texted me with crying emojis that her boyfriend dumped her and that she that she regrets leaving me. i then said: ""your boyfriend? are you talking about this guy?"" and i sent her the selfie i took. she called and texted me several times but i ignored her. my plan was almost successful. there were only three things left that i still had to do.

the first was that i told her mother, who hates infidelity more than anything because her father cheated on her mother with another woman. you could say: like father like daughter. her mother was angry but thanked me for telling her. from what i've heard is that her mother cut ties with her, but i admit that i don't know if that actually happened. and i don't think that it happened. but it would be funny if it was true. the second thing i did was dumping HIM because unfortunately for him he was a cheater too and i hate infidelity as well. the last thing i did was going out with the gay ex boyfriend. and after a few dates we got together and we are still a couple.

in the end i destroyed both her and the guy she cheated on me with and couldn't be more proud of myself.

&#x200B;

Edit: ok for some reason i still get too many messages. no the f\*ck i will not tell you details about the threesome you horny mfs so stop asking!",5758,0.91,264,Pure_Pepper3666,2022-11-07 13:03:30,yowron,6022,High
NuclearRevenge,"They screwed me out of my pay, I screwed them out of their company","Many years ago I got a job with a marketing company during phone deregulation.  It was the wild west and a lot of small long distance companies sprang up, all trying to get a piece of the pie.  Eventually they all got bought up by the bigger fish, but at the time they were all paying hired gun marketing firms very well to score contracts for them to lock people in.

I got a job with one of those marketing firms, a New Age Capitalism company that insisted we all do yoga and breathing exercises while they rang a little bell and gave us affirmations about how many contracts we were all going to sell and how much money we'd all make.  The job was 100% commission, but I was always good at sales so I looked at the pay scale and noticed that it was exponential, presumably to entice people to work hard with impossible pay-outs.  We were allowed to work as many or as few hours as we wanted, with the pay-out based on your weekly sales numbers.  I decided I would give it a shot for one week to see how much I could realistically make before deciding whether I was willing to put up with the tasteless vegan snacks and mandatory voluntary yoga regime.

For the next week, I pushed myself as hard as I could.  For seven straight days, I worked 14+ hour days every single day and used every trick and technique I had learned doing sales to score as many contracts as I possibly could.  I figured this would tell me my maximum possible income and could decide on that basis whether to stay.

At the end of the week, I had blown everyone else out of the water.  In fact, I had not just gotten more contracts than anyone there had ever seen in a week, I had gotten more than any of them had seen in a *month*.  Because of the exponential scale, I realized that I was making absolutely ridiculous amounts of money, $10k+ a week.  They had never expected anyone could actually hit those kinds of numbers.

Coming in the next week, expecting a huge payday, I ended up with about 5% of what I expected.  They told me there were problems with a lot of my contracts, and that I would be allowed to fix them and submit them a few at a time over the next several weeks.  These ""problems"" were things like an apostrophe wasn't quite clear or the dash in someone's phone number was slightly crooked.  They were going to screw me.

That night I got a phone call from the company's office manager, Frank, who wanted to meet up for a drink.  Curious, I agreed.  Over beers, Frank told me that the owners of the company were in a panic because I would have bankrupted them.  He said they spread out all my contracts on the floor of the office, then they crawled over them, inspecting each one and trying to figure out if I was committing some kind of fraud.  When they comprehended that all my contracts were legit, they decided they had no choice but to screw me over.  Frank told me he realized at that point that if they would screw me, they'd screw him too and, besides, he was tired of doing yoga.  He asked me if I would be interested in going into business with him and go head to head with his bosses.

I thought it sounded intriguing, but I asked him how he thought we could compete.  Frank explained that he had found out they didn't actually have the contract for our city.  They were acting as independent contractors for another company who had the contract to market the service in an entirely different city.  They were poaching here, because the person who did have the contract wasn't actively using it.

We put together a pitch and approached the guy with the real contract, Joe, and told him about the people poaching his turf.  We agreed that we'd split with him; we'd take the up-front money for each contract, and he'd get the back end money down the road.  It was a good deal for everyone, so Joe contacted the phone company and had them threaten the poachers with a big lawsuit if they didn't stop.

A week later Frank and I strolled into the offices of our old employer.  Most of the furniture (and all the yoga mats) was gone, and there was just a table, a couple of filing cabinets, and a file box with the final pay envelopes for everyone.  I made a show of counting my money to make sure it was all there, and the two owners, husband and wife, told Frank and I bitterly that they'd had to take cash advances on their credit cards for this money, and asked me if I felt guilty for destroying their lives.  I smiled and said, ""nope,"" and left.

Our marketing company made us a lot of money over the year until the company got bought up by Sprint and the gravy train ended.",4654,0.98,111,HuntingTheWumpus,2022-11-01 14:14:23,yji5ky,4765,High
NuclearRevenge,Pedophile gets entire life ruined.,"I’ve gotten permission by my older sister to write this story. I’m not the one doing the revenge here rather my Father, uncles and a few gang members.

My parents came to the United States in 1987 coming from Zacatecas, Mexico. A few of my Uncles and Aunts were living here in South Central LA before my parents came. I have in total 5 siblings 2 sisters and 3 brothers. I am the youngest now 18 years old. 

My sister is 3 years older than me. Now 21. She was 13 years old at the time of this story. 

My uncles were gang affiliated and my eldest uncle now 62 was an amazing tattoo artist (relevant to this story). My dad wasn’t a gang member but was well known in our city, for participating in gang activity but was never jumped in. 

One of my uncles threw a party for his daughters birthday. Practically anyone who wanted in the party was allowed to join in. I know stupid mistake for them. Myself, my brothers and mother weren’t at the party as it was also my mothers sisters birthday and we enjoyed being around her more. But my sisters went with my dad as they were close to my uncles daughter. 

My sister was left alone sleeping in my cousins room since our parties always ended up going until the next morning. The door to my cousins room did not have a lock. As my sister was sleeping she felt someone touching her. As she woke up she realized it was a boyfriend of one of our older cousins (17) boyfriend was 19 at the time. Nothing was known beyond that until a month later when my sister had finally told my mom. Brave of her since she was only 13 many people at that age keep quiet for years. 

By then everyone in my dads part of the family became aware of this. Including my older cousin the one with the pedophile boyfriend. She was heartbroken but agreed on something with her Dad. She set up her then boyfriend into meeting up with her at a local park. 

My dad along with my uncles and a few members waited at the park at around 9pm very lonely, barely lit, quiet park. A friend of my uncle known as Santi (rest in peace) had a small RV in which they waited in.

The piece of shit arrived at the park that’s when my dad and the rest ran up to him and started beating the shit out of him until they dragged him into the RV. Once inside still continued to beat the shit out of him until they arrived at my uncles place (the one who did tattoos). 

Once they arrived they took him inside where my uncle was ready with all his equipment and gave him some new art work all over his face, neck, head and hands. All over he had writing indicating that he was a pedophile. Including an extremely big tattoo across his forehead all the way to the right side of his head. 

They waited until he woke back up now around 2am. They dumped him in front of his fathers house. Not to be discovered by neighbors until the sun came out. 

My father left a heavy well written note on the door of the piece of shits dad house. This led to his dad giving him his own set of beatings and finally kicking him out of his house. Surprisingly one of his friends let him stay with him for awhile until a month after the incident, him, two of his friends were found guilty on a murder charge. Apparently the murder happened around 3 months before this whole incident. Pedophile was charged with a second degree murder along with a few other charges. He was sent up to Chino Penitentiary. 

2 Months in the Pen he was raped, beat and finally killed by some African Americas getting shanked 3 times in his chest by a screwdriver. Not sure if this happened due to his tattoos indicating he was a child predator. Or if it was mostly a race thing. 

Regardless if any of this didn’t happen he would’ve still been taken to the pen due to his conviction. So my uncles and father have no guilt for this. 

My older cousin understandably mourned his death for awhile as it was so unexpected for him to turn out to be such a piece of shit to this world. They were together 3 years prior to this incident. As for my sister she is doing well for herself currently attending Cal state Long Beach. 

I’m not sure if I can link his case on here or if it will be taken down. If you’ll like to read about that, i’ll send that to you privately to prevent this from being taken down.",3612,0.96,205,No_Anteater9660,2022-10-31 19:03:45,yit5rb,3817,High
NuclearRevenge,My boss suspended me for his negligence so I ruined his life.,"For a little context: I work at a vape shop which is already in a rough space due to regulations and laws the government is putting on us.

Due to the lot being absolutely massive we couldn't get it all done in time for us to help customers. As they came and went we noticed the snow being patted down into the ground and essentially turning into a slip and slide. Of course he didn't do anything about it and asked me and another coworker to clear all the garbage out of the other side of the building. When I did, I slipped and hurt myself. I didn't file for workers comp, but told them I'd need to rest myself while at work. The next shift I sat almost the entire shift and because I couldn't do anything I sat on my phone, only to get up to help customers. The next day my manager tells me he got out of a meeting with the owners son and I was suspended for a week (5 shifts). As I'm a college student and rent an apartment and have car payments, I couldn't afford to lose 5 days of pay. I marched into his office and laid it out that either he fires me so I can collect unemployment or unsuspend me. He told me neither was happening and that he was gonna use me as an example to the rest of the employees. I was pissed and cursed him out. He doesn't like confrontation so he shortened my suspension to get me out of the office. He then treated me poorly and singling me out for everything everyone else also does, but I was the only one being punished. Then comes the fact that he wanted to ""reconcile"" by forcing me to do handiman work around the place and didn't give me the tools, equipment, or training to do or use any of these objectives. This was the tipping point for me.

The revenge: Due to being constantly singled out I came to learn that everyone else was unhappy with this fact. I learned all the dirty little secrets about the company including illegal products, labor violations, tax violations, etc. I used these secrets that I learned to call multiple government agencies (FDA, OSHA, DOL) and report him by name. First, OSHA came and did an inspection on my day off. He told everyone they only cited him for a small violation and he was good other than that. I was obviously angry at that but a few weeks later I got a packet in the mail telling me he got cited for everything and he was getting massive fines. I then get called into the office again with the manager who told me I was suspended. He proceeded to tell my manager that he was getting demoted for not writing me up more and that I was no longer getting my raise until I ""fixed my attitude"". This of course was right after he said ""I don't care that you called OSHA"". This little act is known as retaliation which is illegal to do to people who called a protected agency like OSHA. He refused to even look at me at this point because if he did anything that would imply he was punishing me for calling OSHA I would have a lawsuit to destroy him. 

Now to today: another day off for me and I get a text from a coworker at 11 am. That message was ""FDA is here. The manager quit and it's crazy"". The FDA and IRS came rolling in full force in black trucks/SUVs. They came in and raided the place, seizing all illegal products and all the paperwork pertaining to the business. They're still there as I write this, so hopefully there will be more to come, but knowing how this works out in most cases I won't have a job much longer and will be on unemployment. 

TL:DR: my boss punished me for hurting myself at work, so I called a bunch of government agencies on him and probably got all of his businesses shut down.

Update 1: the ATF also showed up. They confiscated all the house made juices. We apparently don't have a manufacturing license. None of us knew this and that means we may no longer be able to sell products. The IRS showed up because there's a possible cause for an investigation into tax evasion. As I learn more I will continue to update.

Update 2: It seems as though through talks with the lawyer the son decided to actually take the heat for all of it and is going to have to pay massive fines and is possibly looking at jail time. He likely won't ever be able to get a manufacturing license for the rest of his life and they said essentially that he won't be able to open any new businesses. I know he had two new locations rented out and in the process of opening and those are never going to happen now. They're raiding his other business today and that's going to be interesting considering that if he doesn't have the paperwork for that business it could lead to much much more jail time. So as of right now even though my job isn't shutting down yet, his other business is getting raided, he can't open the two locations that he's put a shit ton of money and time into, and he's going to be fined all he's worth and possibly go to jail. Will continue to update!

Final update: Hi guys!! Sorry for the long wait for an update!! After many long months and tons of setbacks, me and the other guys from my last vape shop have opened our own! We want to do everything the right way and make it a place where people can come and hang out like vape shops used to! It's a 21+ sober building. We hope to make a safe and enjoyable environment for everyone and also provide them with safer alternatives to smoking cigarettes & cigars and using dip/chewing tobacco.",6507,0.97,313,Top_Professional_69,2022-10-20 15:24:56,y98x5t,6820,High
NuclearRevenge,Bully tries to act like it was in school; guess I will tell on you then,"In secondary school I was tormented by a specific Bully, for years I was beaten up and publicly humiliated on a daily basis. the worst thing he did was beat me up so bad that I got a concussion and broken ribs when I was 14, he never faced consequences in school because his family was rich and he was pretty popular.

for context I live in a pretty small town in England so everyone knows everyone including the bully

he left the school when I was 17 and I didn't see him for about a year, around this time I got way more popular and started going to parties and making more friends, and annoyingly he was friends with some of my friends and his GF was at my school but I managed to avoid him mostly until I finished school.

Unfortunately I saw him a few months later my and my friends went to the pub to celebrate our exam results, and he was a complete asshole to me, started insulting me and mocking me to my friends saying ""why do you hang out with \[me\]"" bringing up a bunch of stuff from years ago, and at one point put me in a headlock and told me that my friends only hung out with me out of pity.

I wasn't going to take it but I also wasn't going to get into a punch up because I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of getting me angry, and right at that moment I overheard the perfect thing, he was bragging to his friends about the house party he was having and saying about all the drugs he was going to take to the party, and said he had it all in his car, 

it wasn't just a bit of weed either if I remember correctly he said he had 13 bags of coke about 30 pills of mdma and 7 or 8 of grams of ketamine, and then I knew what I would do for my revenge on the guy

as he was leaving I followed him to his car and took a photo of his number plate, then after he was driving off I walked off and called the police

I knew they needed something more than hearsay to stop the car especially because I didn't want to be traced back to it so I told the police I saw my bully snorting a white powder in the Pub toilets (this was a complete fabrication) and then get into the drivers side of the car I then provided them with the licence plate of the car and told them the direction they were heading in. 

I honestly didn't think they were going to stop him or maybe they would ask him questions later and ruin his party but the driving on drugs allegation plus the fact he had been arrested for minor possession before (which I didn't know at the time) was enough for the police to take it seriously, and stop and search his car, which they found all the drugs he was transporting to his party, and he got arrested for it.

the consequences of his arrest meant he lost out on his university place, his rich parents had enough of his behaviour so kicked him out and cut him off from their funds.

and a rumour I heard was that in turn for a lower sentence my bully ratted out his supplier. Which resulted in him getting stabbed multiple times and as a consequence of that now has to wear a colostomy bag and that plus his criminal record means he is currently unemployed

TLDR: I Called the Police on my former bully which started a domino effect that resulted in him losing his opportunity to go to university, a criminal record, getting stabbed and now the shitbag has to have a literal bag of shit strapped to him",5770,0.98,201,Leading-Road8119,2022-10-14 09:29:43,y3vhkf,5971,High
NuclearRevenge,Which forms of revenge should he prohibited?,"Hello!

After my recent post prohibiting revenge porn (especially that of which involves minors), it had me thinking that there are some other terrible acts that don’t deserve attention and shouldn’t be respected or glorified here.

I’m thinking on implementing a rule that covers more bases than one and cleans the dirt from them. I have a short list of topics that should fall under under a potential ban:

1. Revenge porn - No use of pornography to shame an individual. While effective, it seems to be aimed at minors in people’s stories. 

2. Sexually motivated revenge - No sleeping with the offender’s friends, family or lover to create jealousy. This is petty and makes for an easy fictional story.

3. Animal abuse - They’re called pets not hurts. Leave them out of it.

4. Intentionally harming others (not collateral) who aren’t involved in the offensive act - If they weren’t looking for trouble, don’t find it for them. 

That’s just a few that come to mind. Are there any others we should look out for? Do you agree with this change?

Thanks,

NuclearRevenge,Why we don't see Uncle Mark anymore,"So. This was told to me by my dad over a drink recently. He'd gotten a little drunk and ended up admitting it to me, said it's been too long now and he'd paid the consequences so there was nothing to come back on him (only reason I'm posting this).

Uncle Mark was my FAVOURITE uncle when I was a child, he always invited me around to show me his airsoft gun collection, hide and seek parties with my friends and even took us to the beach!

He would always come with sweets for us and acted like one of us, another child who just wanted to have fun.

But then... the day I (7 years old) was meant to be going around because we were going for a ride to this 'amazing place'.

My dad was happy and cheerful for the entire day, he was going on about how much he loved the fact his brother wanted to be in his children's life... until he got a call. I was in my room, packing my stuff when I heard the most blood curdling scream from my dad, he was screaming and raging, I heard him rip open our front door and slam it back shut with enough force to make the picture next to it fall off the wall.

I didn't see my dad for a long while after that, and he never told me why until we had this talk, but that shall be explained at the end.

Mum had a lot of money saved up from a minor lotto win so we were okay and she always smiled and said ""daddy is just away for a little while because he was looking after me and my siblings"" whenever I asked where he was.

Uncle Mark didn't come around either during this time, but we did see him in town a couple times... funnily enough, he ran away the moment my mum saw me waving at him.

9 months later, dad came home and I excitedly ran and hugged him, he hugged me right on back with a good squeeze. We had a party to celebrate him coming home, we had parry food and cake and all the usual stuff, I was just happy my dad was home though.

A week or so later, dad sat me down with the other children and explained that Uncle Mark wouldn't be coming around anymore, when asked why, he just said Uncle Mark was a bad person and that if he ever tried to talk to us, we were to ignore him and come find one of them.

We all agreed because my dad always knew best after all.

One day, a year or so later (9 at this point), I'm coming out of school to wait for my parents to pick me up (my other siblings were either at secondary school or too young for school so it was just me) I see Uncle Mark stood there with a big grin.

I get nervous when he comes up to me, saying he's here to take me for a ride, I tell him I'm not supposed to talk to him, that he's a bad person like my dad said.

Uncle Mark got this scary look on his face for a second, then told me it was all good and his parents had changed their mind and made to take my hand.

... that's when I saw my dad just APPEAR.

My dad punched Uncle Mark right in the face and little old me saw blood fly as Uncle Mark went sprawling. I didn't see much after that except Uncle Mark running away with my dad chasing him.

He came back after a little while, sighed and took me in a hug. He told my mum to take me home and that he'd see us later.

I don't know why, but I knew there and then it would be a long time before I ever saw my dad again.

And I was right.

5 years. 

5 years my dad was gone, my mum eventually admitted to us that he was in prison for protecting us and we all guessed he'd done something to Uncle Mark.

And he had.

Turns out Uncle Mark liked kids. He liked them a LOT.

And that day I was meant to go to his house, my aunt (Uncle Mark's wife) had called my dad and told him she'd found some pictures under her and Marks bed of children and she was scared of what to do because Mark was a big man and it was later revealed he abused her so she was scared to call the police on him, and my dad had gone into a rage and stormed over to his house.

He'd smashed in the door to find Uncle Mark screaming at my aunt as she waved the pictures around in hysterics.

My dad had beaten Uncle Mark within an inch of his life, Uncle Mark screaming he'd make him pay as the police had arrested my dad.

Messed up thing was, by the time my dad had explained WHY he had done it, Mark managed to get the pictures, burned them and scared his wife into saying nothing so there was no evidence. My dad was sent down for assault but made sure my other uncles and older cousins were around to protect us in case Mark came back.

But oh no.

Mark waited until my dad thought we were safe.

And then, according to my dad, had come to kidnap me from the school right under their noses. Who would stop him? People didn't believe my dad when he explained Mark was a Predator, they thought he was just excusing himself for attacking him. After all, the police hadn't found anything and his wife said my dad was a liar, whereas my dad was the big angry guy with a few assaults under his belt already. So all they saw was my nice Uncle here to pick me up.

He HAD gotten away from my dad at the school, my dad had tripped and it gave him the chance to run.

But my dad knew where he would go.

Knew Uncle Mark would run home to hide and more than likely destroy any evidence he had gotten since destroying the last lot.

He also knew the police would be on his tail for the attack on the school so he didn't have long.

Difference was, though, my dad had his car while Uncle Mark was on foot.

So.

He drove over and demanded to know if my aunt was going to lie again, after what Uncle Mark had just tried to pull.

Now. I don't like my aunt much after what she pulled the first time, but I think in that moment she really realised what a monster my Uncle was. He was willing to do this to her nephew just for pathetic 'revenge' for being called out as a Predator.

She said she wouldn't stop my dad or save Mark this time. My dad ordered her to get all the evidence she could as he waited for Mark to appear. She came back down with pictures. LOTS of pictures. He then told her to go, wait 1 hour and then call the police. He was ending this.

And as Uncle Mark appeared, my dad, who had been waiting behind the wall of his garden, slammed him through the door of his house.

And then proceeded to beat him to death in his doorway, he apparently towards the end couldn't see the floor through the blood.

My dad was arrested on murder and did so without resistance, only saying he wished they'd done his job for him. 

But when it was revealed that Uncle Mark was indeed a Predator who had attempted to kidnap me and the fact that they had to face the fact they had allowed a Predator to run free, he was instead charged for manslaughter, his lawyer stating my father had 'gone into a protective rage and had only intended to render him harmless'. 

Funnily enough no one argued in defence of the Predator for my dad getting the murder charges. 

He said he didn't regret it, but that he wished he had done something else purely so that he didn't miss out on so much of my life.

I told him I was forever going to be proud of him for that, and that I loved him.

I was a bit shocked I wasn't told just WHAT uncle Mark was for so long. But my dad asked if it would have made it any better to be told as a child what he really was, or now as a man who can handle the truth... and he was right. Me as a child would NOT have been able to mentally handle it... I'm barely able to handle it now.

TLDR; My uncle was a Predator, dad found out and beat the stuffing out if him. Uncle tried to kidnap me in revenge and ended up dead.",7619,0.97,257,Last-Background8641,2022-10-09 06:37:31,xzjiue,7876,High
NuclearRevenge,Pervy Ex-stepfather gets his just desserts; A Nuclear Revenge tale that took 15 years to pay off.,"Hey people. This nuclear revenge tale took 15 years to finally resolve, and I couldn’t be happier.  First, some background is needed to get the setup. 

My ex-stepfather( I refuse to acknowledge that he married my mother, and since my mother is deceased, I shouldn’t have to anymore) is an awful man. 

My mother married him because she thought I “needed a man in my life” to help raise me. He was abusive verbally, and was just a toxic person to be around. Even when my mother and he divorced, he still insisted on trying to see me, and I had to be forced to go see him and his new wife every other weekend. 

When I moved away from the city he was in, due to me ending up in foster care, I didn’t bother looking him up, nor trying to find out if he was even still alive. So, when I moved back in 2008, I was kinda surprised to find out he was still alive. 

Sorry for this lead up, but this is where the foundation of this revenge takes place. 

When I moved back to the city, I had worked my arse off and bought me my first car; a 1992 Buick Regal Custom. I loved that car, and I also loved helping people out, which was easier with a car. 

Well, my ex stepdad knew about the car, because he had seen me driving around town, running errands for the local homeless shelter where I volunteered, taking guys to the doctor’s office when they didn’t want to wait on a bus, stuff like that, and he was a resident at said shelter. 

Through my volunteer work at the shelter, I had befriended a couple of young guys who had landed on hard times, and were just working odd jobs to save up some money to move back to their hometown, the same town I had moved back to the city from. After hearing about this, and their plans to just get a greyhound down there, I told them no, that I would actually drive them there for like $40 in gas, saving them about $250. We made arrangements, and set a date for their departure. 

Apparently, my ex stepdad heard about this, so he cornered them in the shower that night, told them that he was gonna have his way with them, and that I would be expecting the same kind of payment when I got them to that town. When they refused, he threatened to kill them, so they finally accepted. 

When I pulled up to pick them up the next morning, I can tell the air was off, like something had happened. Yesterday, these 2 guys were eager to leave this city behind, and now, they treated my car as if it had live vipers in the passenger seat. So, I asked them what was up. They told me they didn’t know about leaving the city with me, and I assured them it would be fine, not knowing what my ex stepdad had done the night prior. 

After a little coaxing(and me mentioning that the greyhound doesn’t even run to where they were trying to go), they loaded up my trunk, and off we went. I could feel the tension in the car, and it had become so thick, that you could slice through it using a hydro jet. 

After we crossed into the neighboring state, they asked me if I could just drop them off at a hotel, and they would try to find other accommodations down to where they were going. I said I wouldn’t mind, but wanted to know what brought on the sudden change of plans. 

After a tearful choking up in the back seat, they told me what had transpired the night before with my ex stepdad, and I saw red. Ooh, I absolutely despise this man!!! 

I wanted to, no, I NEEDED to hurt him, but how? After assuring the 2 boys that they were going to be fine, and that I wasn’t even about to put them through what he did, they finally allowed me to take them all the way to their town. I instructed them to file assault charges against him, and to make sure they submit DNA samples to the police, and they assured me they would. 

On the way back, I plotted my revenge against him, and that’s when it dawned on me; my ex stepdad was a registered offender for some stupid night when he was 16. He had told me before that he was caught urinating on an Elementary School’s swing set as a youth, and had to register( that was the main reason I ended up in foster care to begin with, something about “child endangerment”, bureaucratic BS). 

I also know, that he didn’t register in our state for the last couple of years, because, had he did, he would’ve been kicked out of the shelter he was staying in, since they do a 3 times a day, 7 day a week, community outreach meal for not only the residents, but those who needed a hot meal that day, which would also include children. So, on the way back, I had informed the office of admissions staff that they had an offender in their shelter, and if they didn’t get him out, I would report the shelter to the police(they had one of those “safe spot” stickers designating the shelter as a safe space for kids. Did I forget to mention that this shelter also ran a youth summer camp, and had a youth correctional facility and the library right next to it?). 

They took action almost immediately, but when they went to evict him, he was nowhere to be seen. He had taken off, not to be seen again…. Or so I thought. 

You see, when he vanished from the shelter that day, he thought the safest place to hide out was in his hometown, 9 states away. A smarter person would’ve looked up what his registration entailed, and would’ve known that fleeing across state lines without informing law enforcement is a felony, and it doesn’t just stop at the state one left, but carries over to every state between point of origin and destination. So, he had racked up 9+ felony charges against him, just for that little jaunt. 

Fast forward to about 3 months ago, I get a message from the 2 boys on Facebook, asking me for my new number. I give it to them, and am almost immediately put in touch with a county sheriff, who had a federal agent in his office, asking if I knew where my ex stepdad was. As I was telling both gentlemen that I didn’t have a clue, my Facebook pinged. It was my ex stepdad’s wife, telling me to “give her husband a chance to reconcile!” *gag* 

A quick look on her page revealed that they were together, living in my hometown, and what’s more,(seriously, Future Darwin Award Winners here), they were living next door to the school he was caught urinating on all those years ago. I relayed that information to both gentlemen, and asked them what charges they had on him.

They said they had 2 counts of statutory on him, and 3 counts of felony evasion. I mentioned his failure to register, and the day he left my hometown, he had ran to his hometown, 9 states away. The county sheriff informed me that he was calling from that county, and he wasn’t aware of the failure to register charges, but thanked me for informing him. 

Ladies and gentlemen, that dirtbag that nearly ruined my life, my trust with other people, and my reputation in my hometown was finally getting what is owed to him; 25 to life for everything, and isn’t eligible for parole for another 17 years, if he lives that long. He is better off rotting in the depths of Tartarus, for the lives he ruined.",4686,0.97,114,Lucario_Stormblade,2022-09-28 20:58:52,xqv61o,4800,High
NuclearRevenge,Terrible boss gets his comeuppance,"Edit: I’ve seen several comments saying that this is more petty revenge. I have also posted this in r/pettyrevenge and another user suggested that it might belong here. Mods: if this doesn’t meet the standards for this sub, please feel free to to remove!

TL/DR at the end, names have been changed and locations obfuscated to protect all parties, etc… 

Setting: high volume independent tire shop in northern New England, circa 2012. We’ll call it 123 Tire. 

Target: evil general manager. We’ll call him Jay. 

Aggrieved parties: basically everybody that worked there at the time, but mainly myself and the receptionist. We’ll call her Ruth. 

Backstory:

So Jay had been the GM of 123 Tire since he got the previous GM fired in 2004. He was/is a complete narcissist who believed he could do no wrong, and if you didn’t agree with him, God help you. 

Over the years, Jay had done a number of illegal things. For example, he was always VERY physical with his employees. One time, he was wrestling with another salesman (this was commonplace and unavoidable if you valued your job), and the salesman (we’ll call him Paul) took a bad fall and broke his knee. In order to avoid the ire of the owner (we’ll call him Lou), Jay immediately clocked Paul out and told him to go to the hospital. He also told Paul to use his own insurance, and that the company would pay the deductible in order to avoid a messy worker’s comp claim. Paul did as he was told and kept his job, but his knee was never the same and he ended up addicted to opioids thanks to Jay’s actions. 

Jay also had an affinity for the ladies. Now I must mention here that Jay is an ultra “conservative” Christian father of eleven children, who believes that a woman’s place is uneducated, barefoot, pregnant, and in the kitchen. That being said, several female receptionists came and went over the years with only Ruth sticking around because she needed the money and begrudgingly accepted the regular sexual harassment. 

When he wasn’t behaving inappropriately with every lady that walked in the door, he was behaving inappropriately with every other employee.  Want to leave early on a slow day? Wrestle the biggest guy in the shop for it. Jay was big on wrestling (I suspected Jay may also have been “wrestling” with his daughters, but couldn’t prove it. The guy was a real creep). Big guy isn’t in that day? Buy him a pizza. Trying to have lunch? Expect Jay to throw food at you. Want to schedule a vacation? Tough. He’ll let you know the week before if you can take it. He was a complete child, and I put up with him for six long years because I couldn’t let him win. 

The setting:

It was the summer of 2012, and Ruth and I had had enough. Jay was completely out of control as usual, now telling me (a Latino) that if Obama won re-election, that he would make my work life hell come November. Ruth was going through a divorce, and he was trying to move in on her (for the record, Ruth hated Jay’s guts). It was time to hit him where it hurt. 

Ruth was ready to drop a lawsuit for Sexual Harassment on Jay and 123 Tire, and I was ready to drop one for Constructive Discharge. Now suing an employer doesn’t exactly look good on one’s CV, but we were both at wit’s end. 

The revenge:

Ruth and I decided, one evening, that Jay’s ultra conservative values must be shared by his wife and family. As he was always working, his wife must be the one who goes to the mailbox every day.  I created a throwaway email, and got him a “Bill me Later” subscription to Hustler Magazine. And Playboy. And Penthouse. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks, and he comes in looking like death warmed over. Turns out, Mrs. Jay didn’t appreciate his new taste in reading material, and he’s now living in a motel in the next town over. Now he’s not saying that his wife kicked him out, he’s far to much of a narcissist for that, but I could put 2 and 2 together. He’s decided that he’s done with his wife and eleven children, and that he is going to start a new life with Ruth. After all, her divorce is going to be finalized at the end of the week! 

It was at this point that Lou’s sister (co-owner of 123 Tire and not a big fan of Jay, we’ll call her Liz) overheard him talking to Ruth in a less than business appropriate manner. Liz later took Ruth aside and got the straight poop on what had been happening for the last several years, and that was that. 

The next morning, Lou called Jay to his office and was far kinder than I would have been. Jay was to lose his title of GM, and go to work in another 123 Tire location an hour away until the end of the year. Beginning in 2013, Jay would need to find other employment. Jay was also not to contact the location that he had overseen and worked in for years. Also, the location that Jay was relocated to added an hour to his already hour long commute. I suspect that Lou also encouraged Jay to reconcile with his wife, which Jay did. 

Epilogue:

Jay ended his employment with 123 Tire in January of 2013, and never suspected any involvement from me. In fact, to this day, he stays in occasional contact with me. 

He went on to work for another tire store, this one a corporate chain, as a store manager. Put his house on the market, bought a new one closer to his new employer and everything. A year later he was fired after bringing a seven figure lawsuit on them. They settled out of court, and he moved back to the house he was in before, as it hadn’t sold. 

Jay’s next job was five minutes from his home, and his new boss was: the guy that Jay had gotten fired back in 2004! That one lasted a couple of years, until Jay gave up on finding employment in the area and moved himself and the whole family to the Midwest sometime around 2016. 

Now in the Midwest, Jay has been unable to keep a job in the car business for more than a year, and as soon as each of his kids turns 18, they seem to move right back to the area they grew up in. 

His New England home sold in 2019 for less than he bought it for.  

Ruth still works for 123 Tire, and is very happy there now. 

The icing on the cake:

In early 2021, I finally left my job at 123 Tire, sold my house, and became a full time RVer. I’ve seen 47 US states, including the midwestern state (and town!) that Jay now resides in. I looked him up when I got there, and he came to see me after he got out of work in my new RV. 

He said “Boy, you must really think something of me to look me up and want to see me all the way out here!”

If he only knew the half of it…

NuclearRevenge,Revenge Porn Is Prohibited,"Recently, I have removed a couple of revenge porn stories. One of them went public and the other was quickly removed.

Unfortunately, these stories contained minors as the antagonist. And while stories containing criminal acts are allowed here, we have still decided to prohibit revenge porn. For obvious reasons.

Ideas such as revenge porn allow for any weirdo to make up a sick fantasy for karma that may potentially compromise this sub and quite honestly makes the protagonist the villain at that point.

If someone is going to get back at someone else, we prefer they keep it classy rather than stoop to their lowest self. They’ll get more respect with a greater chance of us keeping their story up if they post it.",2968,0.97,89,claycam6,2022-09-14 13:29:51,xe9fiy,3057,High
NuclearRevenge,This will be along one soo grab some popcorn,"Troaway to protect identity, all the names are made up and bla bla bla.

Let me start with a little background. Me 28 M and my wife 26 F married 3 years ago and been togheter for 6 years.

When we meet i was already in my 3rd year of college for a special branch of an verry productive industry something like USA army you go in a different contry for a few months do some really dangerous jobs get pay A LOT come back a few months and soo on. In the begining i was going for 6, 8 or even 10 months away in order to promote as fast as possible. Now i win around 4 years of medium salary in my country in just 3 months. Is a hard job but i love it.

My wife was verry supportive and i always knew that is verry hard for her to have this kind of lifestyle. I alwyas tried to spoil her and compensate for my time spent away from her with tons of gifts and trips to exotic places.

Two years ago when i came home after an extended contract (i had to stay almost two more months because all flights and borders got shut down durring covid but got 20% extra salary durring this time) she told me she can\`t take it anymore she goes crazy alone at home and she has nothing to do (she lost her job during covid and did not wanna work again after that wich i fully support her because i wanted her to be happy and money was not a problem). I was petrified and at first i belived she wanna brake up. Then she continued with i love you soo much and i want you to give me a baby soo i can take care of him and have a little bit of you when you are gone on contracts.

After 5 months of hard work with no women in a 100 km range making a babby was.... Done verry fast. And multiple times just to be sure, if you know what i am talking about.

I was nervous for the first month because we always feard we may not be able to make a baby (for the first 4 years we did not use any kind of protection except pull out and she never got pregnant). But after a few weeks she wakes me up with a long kiss and a smile on her face then shows me the test result.

I was the happiest man alive

Everything changed i was a man now i was a father i was on top of the world. I was going with her on every doctor apointment and durring contract i was asking for echosounds instead of nudes :))

The birth had not complications and everything went amazing. One month later i go on another contract to make some money that should cover every needs for our little baby. Half-way durring this contract i recive a text from my wife wich shatterd my life

The text was short and simple and i would never forget that 4 words that sent me into deppest depression i had ever had ""I want a divorce"". I did not understand i tried to call her to find out what happened and nothing. After a few days of talking back and forth she said. ""I want a divorce soo i can marry with the love of my life""

I was already preparing my suitcase because i made a request to my company to send me back as an emergency. When i got home she and the baby was gone. Two weeks later i was in court to settle the divorce. During this i found out that she had a lover for well over 4 years and she plans of marry him as soon as the divorce is done.

Now the laws in my country are different and i knew that my first priorty should be a really good lawyer. My wife had a really shitty one and she decided to speak by herself without the help of the lawyer most of the times. Her hole ideea was I AM A WOMAN and HE IS NEVER HOME. Well even if the laws usually favors women in my country cheating is considered to be a break of contract (wedding contract). And she wanted to take full custoy of our children in order for me to pay child support. I was not letting this happen. I speak with my lawyer and an accountant and it seems that i only had to pay child support from my base sallary my danger bonus is not included in child support because is for my life risk and mine alone. And because the company pays less taxes on the dange bonuses i have a lot of them and my base salary is around 10% of my income. When she found out that she would take almost nothing from child support and i gave her the option of me taking full custody of the child (with a no contact rule) and i will never ask her for child support she agreed in a second. Basically she agreed to get out of our lifes. We even change the birth certificate of the child as me the father and a blank space for the mother. She gave up any kind of claim on the baby.

Durring the trial her lover was asked to come as a withnes. And the idiot agreed.

He is an allyexpress version of Andrew Tate. An ""alpha man"" who treats women like shit and this seems to turns her on, and has a pretty good income he has a small company. Less than half my salary but he is always home and it still is a lot for our country. Now durring the trial he said they cheated behind my back for 3 years and that the baby is his and she tricked me to make her a babby in order not to find out about her cheating. He said all this just to make me feel horrible i guess because this is actually kinda ilegal something like alienate the love and other law terms my lawyer explained to me (he basically said i knew they are married but i decided to ruin the marriage)

Now at this point the child situation was already done and an agreement was signed. The judge aked my wife if it was true and she said yes and ordered an DNA test just to comfirm. After the DNA test that comfirmed what they said the judge said she will let me cancel the agreement and settle the situation again with my wife now that the child is not biologicaly mine.

I said ""No your honor. This child is mine and i wanna keep him""

The judge was stunned for a minute but then she said: ""Well if the agreement is a valid contract and since you don\`t want to void it then Mister L you are a father and no one can take that child away from you"" in my country it doesn\`t matter who is the biological parent it matters who is the parent in the documents. And since he knew he is the father since the begining and did not come to the hospital to declare it he automatically canceled all his paternal claims. Sounds stupid but it makes senes is in order to protect the ideea of a family and if a man recognise a fatherless child at the hospital he should not fear that the biological father will come back is in order to protect the value of family and encourage people to do a good think and start a family and things like that.

Now the divorce was over i got my baby and my wife was out of my life.

First thing i did was hire 3 babysitters to work 8 hours a day soo my child has 24/7 someone to stay with him and i have time to prepare my revenge.

I started 2 separate companies with the help of an online assistend from India. You can hire them kinda cheap and they do whatever you need in online. This guy made 2 super profesional companies one in industrial credits (give money to busnises for a lower rate that banks) and the second one was a copycat of my ex company but this one was in the same city as his.

Both were made just for one client my ex wife lover. My assistent started sending tons of ads to my credit company to him. E-mails targeted google/fb ads etc. I was sure that he knows that if he needs money this is the place he can take a lot with low rates. Next i made a lot of advertise on the second company. But the company had only the machines and the rented space and only one worker (the cleaning lady :)) ) everytime someone call for the company services they got imediatley decline because we are overbooked. My ex lover (lets call him D) was one of them. Multiple time actually and he goes mad everytime he got rejected because he sees how big the competition is.

Now it was the time to give him the bait. Because my company had some ""Problems in the main country"" i don\`t even know in wich country this company was registerd they changed the management and wanted to make some fast profit soo the regional manager wanted to sell some of the equipments. When he heard this he started calling and sending emails to buy them out. The response was something like: we are an international company we can\`t sell the brand but we can sell some equipments. ( it was ilegal to me to sell the company without showing him the acountants data wich was empty but equpments i could sell just with an simple contract). He wanted the competition out of his city he did not need the equipment. Soo the ""manager"" give him a deal. If you buy our equipments for lets say... 3 times the price we can say in the contract that we will not make business again in this city. In just 2 hours i recive calls and emails on my first company for a credit for that equipment and bla bla. I knew he was out of money because he spent a lot on his future wedding with my ex wife.

I\`ve send him a contract. Based on our evaluation the equipment is not worth that money soo he will need to give us a guarantee (his company) and he is not allowed to sell any equipment or parts of his company until he pays everything back and if he is behind in payment for 6 months straight i get all of it. Also in the contract i stated that the credit company will buy that equipment directly (basicaly i just give myslef my money). And i made sure everysingle word of the contract is legal and is a deal good enough for him to take it. Later that same day he sent me the signed contract.

Now normaly he should be able to pay for everything even if the clients he hoped he will get from this company leaving are not existent he still should be able to pay if he give me around 80% of his company income for the next 5 years.

Fastforward a bit. In the day of they wedding I go to give them an envelope (In my country you give money in evelopes as wedding gift) he start to laugh at me and tell me to get out cause i am not invited and he don\`t need my money.

I smiled and i told him to open it. He look inside and he was expecting to come in court next week. He laugh and asked what is this and i told him ""See you in court, enjoy your wedding night""

Next week he came, I was suing him for child support. As i said in my country if you are aware that you have a child and refuse to go to the hospital to recognise him you are no longer the father but you are still forced to pay child support and is actaully an increased rate because you tried to dodge resposability like running from an car accident scene.

He did not want to pay soo he tried to say that he wants the child or co-custody that he is the biological and blood and bla bla.

This made me happy because i wanted to drag the trial as much as possible to drain him of all his money. But i couldn\`t after the judge saw all his declarations durring the divorce trial she ended the trial really fast and forced him to pay me 40% of his (and his company income) since the child was born until he will finish college or i get married.

And guess who did not manage to pay. And guess who is the new owner of his company.

Now i don\`t work anymore i just run his company and spend almost all my time with MY child

UPDATE:

A lot of people asked me about the child and the fact that i am not a bio father. I answered to some comments but i wanna put this answer here soo people will stop asking.

 

I do not plan to hide my child that i am not the bio father. As i said in a previous comment we will talk about this when the time will come in highschool maybe or around that age. Untill then i will try to be the best friend and paternal figure i can be and i my child decide to go to the bio father then i will not have any objection.

Decive into bonding? I need this child more than you think. After all that happened i don\`t want a relationship anymore and i am verry lonely and beeing financialy free i have no purpouse in life anymore.

And about the statistic yess statistics do not lie. And i did punish paternity fraud. But i punished the idiot who did it not the inocent child. I haras him every month if he is one day late on child support and i have a lawyer on payday just to mess with him and scare him with another court call. I do not give a F about every man and bla bla i take care of myself and my child and other peoples are not my busines. If you are soo insecure that you think i must punish my child soo women will be scare to cheat on you then maybe you are the problem.",3162,0.95,204,Excellent_Usual_9708,2022-09-13 03:51:12,xd2bq3,3366,High
NuclearRevenge,next time it's lead and not paint.,"Back in the winter (or maybe late fall) of 2004/2005 One of my friends (Victor the victim) had an issue with bullying by Chad. I can't remember what the bullying was I only remember the most epic and nuclear of reactions. Victor attempted suicide and spent weeks out of school before coming back.

&#x200B;

So this bullying that lead to a fist full of prescription pills and victor getting his stomach pumped in the ER. Not your garden variety bullying.

&#x200B;

After months of attempts of doing things the right way unsuccessfully we planned our attack. And yes,  I consider it an attack.

&#x200B;

Before anyone sugestes ""You could have shot his eye out"" we discussed that possibility... none of us cared if that was the outcome.

&#x200B;

Quite simply we waited until Victor was documented to be at work late one night. Our posse (4 of us) gathered up a bunch of paintball guns and equipment, forest camo/dark clothes and jumped the bully in his driveway when he was getting home. We unloaded on him with paintballs not giving 2 shits about whether or not we shot his eyes out. By the end he was rolling around covering his face while getting repeatedly shot point blank.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We left a note on under his windshield wipers.

&#x200B;

Next time will be lead

leave Victor alone 

or you're dead""

  
We also took a bunch of tire irons to his car and smashed the hell out of it. Good thing we were wearing full masks because of the little bits of glass flying everywhere.

&#x200B;

 CSI being a thing and all, we used a new pack of note cards sealed in plastic, gloves and deliberate evil looking hand writing that was less hand writing and more drawings with red ink.

&#x200B;

When he finally showed up at school, he looked like had been sent through a meat grinder. He was absolutely covered in blue/black welts and had several bandages on quite a few spots were the skin had been broken.

&#x200B;

Needless to say the cops were called on the incident and there was a big thing in the morning where the cops went into every home room class and asked if anyone knew anything about it.

&#x200B;

The cops tried to guilt us into confessing having no clue who actually did it. They brought up shit like ""he could have lost his vision if his eyes had gotten hit, the issue that he may get permanent scars, they eventually showed pictures in the ER of his blood mixing with paintball paint from the welts being so numerous they were on top of each other.

&#x200B;

The guilt trip strategy to invoke a confession was a good one, except none of us actually felt guilty. 

&#x200B;

Being the smartasses we were we pointed the finger at Victor and one other friend who we knew had an alibi (work). 

&#x200B;

He was jumpy and never the same, I straight up think we gave him fairly moderate PTSD from the attack. Like we seriously pyschologically damaged him. After a few months he ""moved"" and didn't tell anyone where. I think his parents just straight up left town with the kid and he may or may not have graduated elsewhere.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR.. 

&#x200B;

Bully pushed friend to attempt suicide, we pelted him with paintballs at close range until he was covered in welts and broken mentally and then threatened to straight up murder him. And we smashed the hell out of his car for good measure.",2834,0.98,130,Dunnachius,2022-09-04 21:38:25,x64rbp,2964,High
NuclearRevenge,LL tries to defraud us and ends up losing his Visa instead,"This happened a long time ago, but I recently found out about the end result, and figured that it might belong here. 

If you've never heard of the US EB5 visa program, then don't worry, I hadn't either. From what little half-assed research I've gathered, this is essentially a program where foreign nationals can fast-track US residency visa status, by contributing financially to approved community investment projects. I don't think that the specifics are that relevant, but feel free to add if I've missed anything important.

So, when my husband and I were still dating, and first looked for a place to live together, we settled on a small townhouse. it was old and needed work, but the rent was reasonable and it was in a neighborhood we liked. The landlord had recently purchased the property, but didn't live there, and wanted renters to help pay for the mortgage (I assume).

We found the house on a realty website. It had been sold less than a month before we moved in, and still had photographs posted by the seller. (This will be important later)

We liked the place, applied and got accepted. We moved in, and lived happily ever after . . . the end.

No but seriously, landlord left us alone, we lived there for a few years, paid rent on time, never had issues. UNTIL we moved out.

We had to pay nearly 5K in refundable security deposits, and when we moved out, our landlord repaid half. We were confused as the lease laid out the steps the landlord had to take in order for them to keep the deposit. Central to that requirement, landlord had 45 days to provide us with an itemized list of damages we caused, as well as the cost to fix each thing.

45 days came and went, and no itemized list. So we contacted them and asked for the list.

We received a (mostly blank) one page invoice for $2,500.00 to repaint, remove TV mounts, patch holes, etc. It wasn't itemized and there were no individual charges. So we asked for pictures of the alleged damages. landlord immediately got hostile and refused.

So we filed suit. landlord hired an attorney to represent him, and the attorney submitted an itemized list as well as pictures.

We printed date-stamped copies of the photos posted by the previous realtor. The same photos submitted by landlord's clueless lawyer. The clerk overseeing the matter found in our favor immediately. Because landlord had lied about the photographic evidence, landlord was also found to be in breach of contract and was assessed trebel damages plus interest, penalties and court costs. Yay for us!

But he didn't pay, so we submitted to a collection agency (I don't really understand the particulars). We eventually recovered most of the final judgement, so we were happy and left it at that.

. . . until . . .

Unbeknownst to us, landlord was an EB5 applicant. Apparently, the breach of contract, collection and shenanigans surrounding the dishonesty regarding the lawsuit, made it back to whomever was reviewing their Visa application. (There were other issues too I'm sure.) landlord's visa application was denied. He ended up having to cash out of his US investments, and won't be eligible for this Visa again.

The final outcome was an unintended consequence, but I kind of feel like he got what he deserved.

NuclearRevenge,"Call took me out of the closet, let me spill your own ""terrible awful"" into the world.","I will be honest, this story is not mine, but about my two cousins, Alex and Steve. My mother is originally from a small town in the coastal region of my country, she left when she married my dad, but her two sisters stayed in the town. Alex is one of the sons of my youngest aunt, Steve is the son of my oldest.

When they grew up, both moved to a big city in the region for college, but took way different paths. Alex went into a art focused career and after two semesters came out as gay, while Steve went S.T.E.M and bathed himself in the ""machismo""/homophobic culture of the region. You can guess they were not exactly close and , as far as gossip goes, they pretty much hated each other.

As far as Alex sexuality went, it was a well known secret among the cousins and his brothers (teens and young adults, people with social media basically) but was never acknowledged in front of my grandma, the other adults or even his own parents.

That was the context, now lets got to the drama that unleashed on December 2017, at our family's christmas party that ( as always) took place in my grandma's old town house. By midnight, Steve was drunk and looking for a fight, and he thought Alex would be the perfect prey. While not the exact words, you could say this was the statement he shouted in the middle of the dance floor :

""Hey, hey, Alex, where is your girlfriend, I dont see her around. Oh, yeah, yeah, you dont have one. Why is that?! Hey , Auntie, you know why your son didn't bring a girlfriend!? Havent you heard? Oh thats because he is a sissy fa\*\*ot !!! He f\*ck guys, or not, he lets guys f\*ck him, like the little b\*tch he is""

Alex was speechless, and so was the rest of the family, including my grandma. They musicians even stopped the music playing. But before someone could even say something against Alex, he threw THE BOMB (TRIGGER WARNING):

""At least I f\*ck with humans, but let's not forget that your first girlfriend was the neighboors donkey! You even tried to force me to f\*ck her once, didn't you!""

And hell went loose. You see, in this particular area of my country, there is the extended myth that some men, specially teenagers, commit bestiality with donkeys. And in rural areas... is not entirely un-true. But it obviously is never spoken that openly or casually specially when they are ""outsiders"" present.

Like Steve's girlfriend from college, who he had invited.

The poor girl literally threw up in the middle of the party while she started soothing herself and crying like there was no tomorrow. To make an already long story a little shorter, my parents (thankfully my dad doesn't drink and could drive) offered to take her back to the city. We left the party in the mid of shouting, punches, someone fainting at some point, and what not.

But I would not post this here if this had ended there.

Steve's now ex-girlfriend told what had happened to her city friends, to her parents, and basically anyone who would like to hear it.  Steve was already known as a ""donkey f\*cker"" all around the campus before he had even come back from vacation, and his social life crumbled to dust. There was a also a lot of cyberbullying involved, and he ended quitting university.  He went back to the old town and is currently the owner of a bar. He also married a local woman, if anyone wonders what happened to his love life.

On the other hand, Alex ended school and he stayed in the city as a designer. His homosexuality was basically overlooked by everyone ( for obvious reasons) and he is in fact my very catholic grandma's favorite grandson.

The funny part of it all? With time this has been basically thrown under the rug in my family. We still hold christmas parties at the old town house, Alex and Steve keep their distances but can actually speak to each other without murder intent and we all agreed to forget what happened in December 2017.

TL, DR:

Cousin A outed Cousin B in the middle of a family meeting, which ended in him revealing Cousin A's sexual encounters with an animal. This ended in Cousin A losing his girlfriend and leaving college.

NuclearRevenge,"Try to sexually harass my grandma, you might take back a nub","Tried to post to a different sub and was told to post it here.

Recently learned about the revenge subreddits and have  been enjoying some of the stories. As I've pondered things, I figured I'd share a few tales myself. This first tale though involves my grandmother.  

So let me start this by saying  yeah I'm on mobile and English is my first language so please be harsh if you see any errors. Also a short TLDR at the bottom  


Setting- early 60s, medium sized midwestern city, local neighborhood bar.  


The title of this story comes from my grandma's old saying. See, my grandma always carries a switchblade in her purse for protection and she said if anyone ever tried to attack her, they might get her but she's gonna take a piece of them, hence her term ""I'll take back a nub"".  
Some context about my grandma before we get into story time.  
 
My grandma was born in the deep South back in the thirties. She was 1 of 4 sisters who I will refer to for the rest of this as the 4 sisters. My family decided to migrate up to a northern Midwest City in the fifties. Just for clarification my family is African American, so if you know anything about United States history, you would understand why they would want to escape the deep South during this time period.   

My grandma was 20 something when she moved north with her husband(my grandfather). The rest of her family(her sisters, mother, and uncle) also moved up north. Because of housing discrimination, my grandparents were forced to live in the ""black neighborhood"". The rest of the family also lived in this neighborhood and were basically within walking distance of each other.  

The thing to know about the 4 sisters that they were all spitfires.  They are some of the most caring women you can know and were all excellent mothers and grandmothers but they were not to be trifled or messed with. If you crossed one of the,  that might be your ass. This was especially true of my grandmother, who was all of 5'1 and fairly petite.  

The four sisters where quite the characters and it didn't take the neighborhood long to know of these 4 sisters because of their crazy antics. They also loved hanging together on the weekends either at one of their houses or sometimes at the local watering hole.   

On this particular night, my Grandma wanted to go out for a few hours with her sisters. Only one could go(aunt C).  My Uncle, my grandma's oldest son, was in charge of watching his siblings for a few hours on this lovely Saturday night as my grandma dressed to the nines and headed down about half a mile to the local bar to meet up with her sister.  

This was a pretty small bar that got a lot of regulars. My grandma had been there dozens of times and has plenty of stories to tell about her time there with her sisters and also with my grandfather. My grandma and aunt C are lounging in the bar having a couple of drinks and cracking some jokes with some of the regulars when a new character is introduced to the scene. This guy's name is Leroy. He was a regular as well. To picture this guy want you to think about a guy as skinny as Jimmy Walker, and about the height of Kevin Hart.  Combine this and make him about the age of 40 and you'll have Leroy. ( Almost everyone will know Kevin Hart but if you're not sure who Jimmy Walker is look up the sitcom ""Good Times"" and you'll figure out who he is).  

Leroy was a regular at the bar too but then again, Leroy was a regular at almost every bar in town. You see kids, before the internet, online dating apps and hookup sites, the way most people met was at bars. Our good friend Leroy was notorious for wanting to have one night rendezvous with the ladies at the bar. Well everyone knew his game and after he has had a few one night stands with some of the ladies in the neighborhood, most now avoided him like the plague.  

This of course didn't stop him from going to bars on a weekend trying as best to shoot his shot and hoping a lovely filly might come home with him for the night.  

Leroy had flirted with my grandma and aunt on previous occasions and even though he was told that  they were both happily married he keep trying to have conversation with them.  As soon as he entered, he once again strolled over there trying see if he could get some action with either of them.  My grandma quickly told him not to waste his breath but he sat down anyway. What surprised my grandma was  that behind Leroy was another dude. He was well over 6 feet tall and handsome.  My grandma honestly couldn't recall this guy's name so we'll call him jerk.  

My grandma knew right away that this Billy D Williams wanna be was gonna try to sweet talk and charm his way into some ladies pants that night.  It seems that he had his sight set on his first target, which would be of course, my grandmother and my Aunt C.  
 
It seems like our good friend Leroy was gonna try to be jerks wingman. He started off with some small talk to my grandma couldn't tell her how gorgeous she was and something about you know getting lost with heater eyes and all the other nonsense. My grandma said that he had ""diarrhea of the mouth,"" and pretty much let what he said go on one ear and find the nearest exit.  
 
My grandma quickly shut this clown down and let it know she wasn't interested, So then he set his sights on my aunt. Now you know my aunt can take care of myself my grandma was always a little protective of her.  
Jerk made a comment by how nice my aunt's thighs were as he looked lustfully at her.  My grandma quickly told this fool that my aunt was married and not interested in his nonsense.. This is where the story changes and revenge comes into place.  

I'm gonna try to write this dialog as best as she recalls it.  
Grandma- "" she's not interested and she is happy married""  

Jerk-"" she can speak for herself""   

Jerk- ""Your legs must be tired because you’ve been running through my mind all night,""(yes this fool used a pickup line)  

Grandma- "" Are you hard-of-hearing or something or a little slow, I told you she's married and not interested""  

Jerk-"" Bitch, you talk to much. Maybe I'll put what's  my pants down your throat""( he actually said his d\*\*\*, but not sure if I can use that word)  

Ladies and gentlemen, this is where shit got real.  Yes everybody else in the bar knew you wouldn't and shouldn't talk to my grandma that way. She didn't play for that nonsense.  

This is one of those times where you could actually hear a pin drop as everyone got quiet. My grandma exploded with a expected"" what the fuck did you just say,?""  

My grandma was seething with anger but jerk face played off as it wasn't a good idea. My Aunt C knew it was about to go down. She grabbed my grandma and starting leading to the door.  You see my sister knew what many other people knew and that is my grandma kept a ""38 snub nose revolver in her purse and typically kept a very sharp switchblade wrapped up in hers bra.  

My aunt tried to led my grandma out of the bar to avoid any more confrontation but my grandma wasn't having it. As she was being pushed out the door by my aunt and another male customers, my grandma seized a nearby beer glass and flung it towards jerk.  Fortunately glass didn't hit him and erupted close to his feet but it certainly got his attention..

This well over 6' ,well over 200 lbman jumped out of his chair storms towards my grandma saying that he will kick her ass. My grandma replies ""bringing on bringing on. She eventually gets fully outside  and he decides to come outside. He's a little apprehensive because a couple of the neighborhood bar dudes had gotten up to see this and he's afraid they might get involved, you know, since it's unacceptable for a man to hit a  woman and all that jazz.  
The guys said they're not gonna do anything and just want to watch. My grandma quickly pulled out the switch blade that she had in her bra, unwrapped it from the paper and looked him in the eyes and said come on motherf\*\*\*\*\*""  


You would think at this point any civilized person might be  apologizing further for the crude language he used earlier or you would think that the guy, seeing that my grandma had heels on, might just walk away knowing she's probably not gonna chase after them.  Do you think this clown chose either option? If you said he chose neither option, you would be correct, let's give you a prize son.  

What a woman with a switchblade bearing down on him he decides to stand his ground and doubles down by again calling my grandmother a bitch and telling her he's going to beat her ass. He next starts putting up his fist ready it's ready to go to town.    

No worries, no one says my grandma has to fight fair fight fair. You see, what this clown forgot about was my aunt.  While jerk has his fists up ready start striking like he is Mike Tyson, my aunt has conveniently took off one of her high heel shoes. She uses the heel to bash him right in the shoulder blades. Of course this staggers our young jerk. As he turns looking at my aunt screaming obscenities, it gave my grandma time to come and slice this fool right in the side.   

As our young jerk howls in pain, my grandma says to him ""Maybe I'll should slice something else off,"".  The jerk staggered sideways looking at T least 2 infuriated women one with her high heels still in her hand and the other with a switchblade switch blade with the sight of his blood on it.. Don't worry he's wasn't too badly hurt as she sliced him but didn't stab him. By this time a few other people are stepping in and are trying to calm the situation down and jerk left the scene.  

THE AFTERMATH.  

 My grandmother heard from others that the jerk went to the hospital and got treatment for getting sliced on the side. This was the sixties so no cops were called and if they had  been called, they probably would pf been really slow getting to the scene.   

No idea what he told the hospital staff and doctors but regardless regardless heard he got patched up and was no worse to wear. Rumor has it that he ended up moving to Chicago a few months later.  He never tried to get revenge on my grandma for this so there's there's that.   

My grandma says she wasn't gonna tell my grandfather about what happened(he was a over the road trucker and was out of town when this event happened) but you know how things quickly go through the grapevine. He of course scolded her for this but she just gave him a wicked smile and said that the asshole deserved it and that he came at her so it was self defense anyway. Not sure that's exactly entirely true but that's what she's sticking with.  
 
My grandma continued going to that bar every once in a while(and was a bit of an legend. Our friend Leroy ended up being the epitome of a dead beat dad. Rumor has it that he has something like 10 kids with 8 or 9 different women. My grandma still has the switch blade and yeah she showed it to me. It's somewhere in her massive collection of items now,  otherwise I'd attach a picture of it. I also learned that my grandma is a woman of her word because she actually took back a nub in the form of a ounce of flesh from this asshole.  
 Hopefully you enjoyed this story about my grandma. She has told me the story a few times and was a  little fuzzy on couple details ,as she's in her nineties now, but I'll do my best to answer any questions.  

TLDR- Grandma goes to the bar with her sister to be sexually harassed by this asshole who can't take no for an answer.  The moron uses obscenities and calls my grandma derogatory names so she and  my aunt get paid back on the fool outside the bar by slicing him with a knife. ",1954,0.94,145,Proud_Fisherman_5233,2022-08-05 20:02:18,whbi4t,2099,High
NuclearRevenge,"site manager neglected to take care of my property, so I cost the property management company over 500K","Some background- I (35M) own a 72 units apartment complex. When I bought it, it was in a good shape and I spent several million getting all apartments renovated. The rent wasn't increased for any of the tenants and I made sure that it never went up by more than $50 a year for lease renewals (baked into the leases). 


Shortly after all the renovations were completed, I started the search for a property management company and ultimately settled on one that seemed well aligned with wanting to put the tenants first. As we were doing the contracts, I had my real estate friend also look at them. Between him and my lawyer, they recommended having a clause added in there. The short of it is ""If there are any legal actions brought up against me for the apartment complex due to neglect of the property management staff, the property management will be responsible for all those costs and any legal fees incurred."" This wasn't added in secret, and the legal team from the property management company agreed and everything was finalized. They took over the management of the complex a month later. I was fairly hands off and only visited the site every 3-4 months. Other than that, I'd have the monthly updates sent to me by the manager on site. 

A few months ago, I found out that a couple of the apartments had been left in severe shambles after the tenants moved out, and the cleaning crew we had took care of it. I didn't find out until after the fact that it was not completely accurate because one of the apartments apparently had a bad roach infestation in the storage closet outside the apartment. After the new tenants moved into that apartment, they brought up the issue to the Site Manager. In the monthly reporting the Site manager claimed that maintenance staff tried to address with it traps and bug bombs. I didn't think too much of it and left it at that. Next month, the same thing. And the third month, after receiving the monthly report, I called the site manager stating there is a re-occurring issue and I wanted it taken care of professionally at that point. The month's rent was waived for the tenants in that apartment, and they were put up at a hotel for a week while the issue was to be addressed. Once they returned to their apartment is when the issue started. 

The Site Manager either by mistake or by negligence didn't  communicate with the exterminators the extent or the location of the infestation. Instead of the storage closet, the apartment was fumigated, and after that, the roaches made their way into other apartments in the same building and the nearest building, and the problem got so much worse. The same option was given to all the tenants in that building, waiving the month's rent and putting them up in a hotel for a week while the issue is addressed. They all took that offer up, however one of the tenants decided to take legal action. While I wasn'tt happy about it, I understood where they were coming from, having their lives disrupted by something that should have been addressed properly to start. As we were midst negotiating with them during mediations, my lawyer reminded me of the clause with the property management company and suggested we give them what they want. That is where I started my nuclear revenge. 

I had the rest of the tenants from the 2 impacted buildings be suggested to anonymously that one of the tenants had filed a lawsuit for the damage and they should do the same by getting in on it. Through the mediation I pretended to be outraged at the whole matter. The negotiation started at 3 months of free rent but ultimately we all settled on 1 year of free rent for all those tenants. 

Overall that came out to 16 apartments with rent averaging from 1700 monthly that the property management had to pay for due to the negligence of the site manager, equaling to roughly $325,000 in just the lost rent they had to pay for. And the cherry on top- due to the breach in service for Property Maintenance, they also have to provide free services for up to 6 months while I seek out a new property management company, costing them an additional $146,000, and still pay for the legal fees on top of that. 


TL;DR: Site manager screwed with my tenants' homes so I cost the property management company over half a million in damages, lost rent, and legal fees.",5406,0.96,380,Ranthrow607,2022-08-02 15:13:37,weltpx,5786,High
NuclearRevenge,"Tell others I hit my dog, see what's coming for you"," Hi, got a story here.  

Me and my Husband (28f, 29m) are in a chicken breeding club, which provides an allotment garden like structure.  We joined a year ago, and got to know Klaus, an old man who actually lives in one of those said gardens.  At first, he was very kind, helped out 1 or 2 times. But after a while, he got very greedy, telling us to help him in his garden, selling stuff for him on Ebay, or care for his chickens. Some people said we should keep our distance from him, but we didn't listen... He regularly invited us to drink a beer with him, acted like he knew all of town, is well known and has many connections. But the real thing was; yes he was known, but for all the bad reasons. We talked to him a lot in the first few months noticed he's highly addicted to alcohol, and tries to make a dime out of everyone and everything. You know the saying ""blood is thicker than water""? Not for him lol. 

at first he helped us out for example with giving us some tools for free or giving us money for working over at his place. Also, we kinda felt bad for him. Living your last days in a garden shed? But after a while, he gave us near to nothing for our work. No money, broken tools (so, garbage we had to dispose of), not even a “Thank You”. He also started to talk to us in a very demanding tone. Old male Karen like.  Instead of messing with him, we started to simply distance us from him, not doing any more work.  

His last effort to win us back, was to buy 20 weed plants and putting them in his garden and showing us (he knew we smoked). But as soon as he demanded, we sell his future 5 kilos, we backed off again. As others noticed, we didn't hang out with him anymore, they started to tell us how Klaus truly is.  

He started to live there, as soon as another club member (since dead) lost his home and lived on his farm over there (as for the rules of the club, it's not allowed)... If he is allowed to, Klaus had to be too. Klaus lived there for 14 years, not because he got homeless or another stroke of bad luck in life, because he wanted to live as inexpensive as possible. We learned, he had loads of debt. No wonder, considering how much he drank. We found out, this is the case since he was old enough to drink... He tried to rip everyone of off their money, since... ever. His brother, his best friend, even his wife. Some say ""If she was still alive, he would sell his own mother"".  

As the weeks went by, we learned more and more about him, that he had done this with nearly everyone who joined the club, not only with us. We saw it too, as a new member, who's also mentally disabled, cut his hedge for him for 16 hours, and got 20 bucks. And no thank you. Klaus started to dislike the way we stayed out of his way, so his response to that was, to talk crap about us, even threatened us to tell others that we smoke (illegal over here). I mean real full-fledged lies. For example, we would owe him 200 bucks, we would do parties till late at night at the farm, we would hit our dogs... At that last point, we snapped. We bought a drone, made pictures of his weed plants and got police involved. Get them before they get you lol.  

Klaus peacefully sat in the club's community house, drinking beer (9 o'clock in the morning), as 10 police officers walked in, going directly into his garden. Little Klaus turned his head around like an owl and immediately stood up and walked outside. He asked one cop ""hi, can I help you?"" and they asked for his name.  ""Oh, Mr. Klaus, we were actually looking for you"" behind the officer talking to him, the other cops raided his farm, not only finding the plants, but discovered themselves he lives there (living room with obviously used bed, food leftovers, a TV...) They asked him where he has his address, he told them the address of his long deceased brother.  They send a car to this address, but found no clue he could be living there. Btw, he also got money from the state, social benefits, also meant to cover his rent. The rent on this farm is 30 bucks/YEAR. So huge no no, money fraud is one of the worst things you could do over here.   

The cops stayed at his farm for the next 4 hours, collecting evidence. The whole farm surroundings were patrolled by some cops, so, word spread like a wildfire... Every single farm owner got over there to see what was happening, cheering that this douche finally got what was coming for him, after ripping off so many people. It was amazing.  This dude had 14 years to make this farm his little hidey-hole, making money out of it. He had split the whole community, gave us a bad name overall and not even breeding chickens. He just had them to sell the eggs smh.  

To his luck, he was clever enough to tell the cops its only Cbd (still illegal, but not as much), so they had to send it in to test it, buying him some time.  The club held a meeting... That was a shitshow. As soon as this topic started, he said WE planted them there, he only gave us the little plot. Most laughed, some said nothing. We voted for his eviction (had to, as of the rules), he got 15 against him, just 3 voted for him to stay.  So, our revenge is not over yet... Keep you updated.    

 

TL;DR Old parasitic money greedy dude got kicked out of his home and maybe going to jail soon, for growing marijuana.

NuclearRevenge,Your bully son meses with us and you kill our dog? Prepare for dad...,"I posted this on r/prorevenge but was referred to this sub instead after I posted a rage comic on r/memes

This happened in 1995 on a small rural town in Chaco Province, Argentina. Everyone knows each other here until this very day. My father was an electrician, the only one in town, so he was constantly meeting people and as he was born and raised here, he was very well known by everyone. He grew up with many of the police officers from back then and they even had asados together (Argentinean bbq) at least 3 times a months for years. My father was not a violent man. That was the only time I saw him do something like that.

Rhe other man with his busy son, they were not from town. They had moved here a year or so prior, they were from Buenos Aires. I don't really knew the guy, only his kid who was an absolute asshole to almost every kid in the block and he constantly picked on me and my brother since we were the youngest of our neighborhood, therefore couldn't defend ourselves.

Bucky wasn't trained since we knew nothing about training, but he was loyal and playful with every kid. One thing for sure, though, he was protective.
One afternoon we were playing in the park and out came bully kid, who at first threw rocks at us, then got closer and started calling us names and us being little got scared. He was bigger than us. We tried to leave but he blocked us and started hitting my brother, I tried to stop him but he did the same to me. Bucky heard us crying and came running, jumping and getting the bully's arm at once. He bit, shook and released, staying between us and the bully barking like mad until the kid left running. We saw hi get inside his house and a few seconds later came father with the sledgehammer. Bucky stood in front of us, hairs raised and barking but the man didn't stop. He got close, raised the sledgehammer and went straight down to Bucky's head. He did not him once, he hit him FIVE times. The first blow I'll never forget. The sound of the steel connecting with the skull, the painful whimper of our dog... Bucky got knocked with the first blow. By the fifth and final his head was caved in.
My brother and I were frozen in place, scared to death, crying a lot. The asshole dad say something which I don't remember now, and left. We were unable to move for a moment, such was our fear. Finally I grabbed my brother and went home.

Dad was fixing a fan and hen he saw us asked us what happened. We told him and just said ""Right. OK, let's wash your faces and grab some ice cream."" Yes. That's what our dad did. Took us for ice cream. He did a pretty well job to mask his emotions and showed himself cheerful to us. That night, when brother was asleep and I was playing in the kitchen,  he grabbed the wrench, told mom and I he had to fix something in the neighbor (I assumed it was another neighbor since it was a common thing for my dad to get asked by neighbors to fix things), nodded to mom, mom nodded back (yes, she knew) and left. He came back some minutes later, told me to go to bed and the was it.

A decade later we came to know what happened. He went to the guy's house, knocked on the door and punched the dude so hard it rocked his head back. Told him he would break one limb for each of his children whom he made cry (I can only imagine what he would've done if we were more than 2 kids) proceeded to beat the guy some more IN FRONT OF HIS FAMILY and then took the wrench and broke his legs. He then left the house, went home, asked me to go to bed, talked to mom and went straight to the police, turned himself in and was actually delayed until the police went and checked with the other guy. My dad also showed our dead dog to them and the police found the sledgehammer on the bully's house still with blood on it and they let my father go. They also spoke with the dude when he got better and suggested him to leave the town since if they weren't liked before, they wouldn't ever be now. To this, you gotta understand the mindset from some small rural towns. We looked at outsiders with mistrust back then and it took a while for people to get used to you if you were new in town. However these people came and weren't very much liked. Apparently because of the kid and the father was also an asshole.

I do not condone the actions of my father, nor am I justifying in any way the events that transpired then, but as a father myself I can totally understand to what extent can a man react when hheir kids are at play. I loved my dad and I have mad respect for him. R.I.P. dad, we miss you greatly!

So there, that's the full story. Sorry for my bad English, it is not my native language.

Thanks guys!

Edit: Wow! When I posted this I wasn't expecting this to get this much attention! Thank you all for your kindness and compassion! Recently and because of a message I received by one of you, kind people, I felt the need to include a part of the story that I originally left out involving Bucky, our brave dog. This is it: Bucky has defendants!

My brother has what would be Bucky's grand-grandpup now, and he's been adopting Bucky's lineage (if that's the correct term) for a few generations now. He did a good job at tracking down Bucky's litters (he had 2 litters in its short life, with the first being of 5 pups and the second one of 8). My brother, Leandro, remembered everyone who got to adopt Bucky's pups and to his surprise, he found Bucky's blood carried on and is still strong. He adopts a decendant from Bucky every time there's a new litter and has adopted 2 generations so far, every one a straight decendant from a male. All praise goes to my brother, who worried himself with keeping Bucky alive in his life.

Again, excuse my English if I couldn't express myself the correct way or if it caused any confusion upon reading. I'll try to explain better in the comments if asked to.
Thank you all very much and sorry for taking long to post this part!",6268,0.98,447,Davidemagx,2022-07-22 15:27:49,w5khw1,6715,High
NuclearRevenge,My school actually protected me even though I was harassed outside the school premises.,"This occurred over a decade ago. It happened at the end of my senior year of high school. I am from India, and girls are still afraid to tell others about being harassed because of shame and society.

I was enrolled in a big school. There were almost more than 800 students in my school, so you can imagine the rush and crowd while leaving the school. It used to get so crowded and chaotic because there were parents' cars and auto rickshaws waiting to pick up the kids. Some kids are riding their bicycles through the crowd, while others run to the nearby vendors for pani puri and samosas. It's almost like an amusement park.

One day, while walking hand in hand with my friend, I spotted this weird straggling man looking through the bunch of kids. I thought he might be looking for someone specific and didn't think much about it, but I must admit he was creepy.

I saw him again a few more times daily. But one day, when I was walking with my friend, making our way through the crowd, that man crossed me. I was about to collide with him and tried to avoid him, but instead he pushed me and grabbed and pinched my chest area so hard that it began to hurt a lot. He was so smooth with his actions that my friend, who was by my side, couldn't tell what happened. She kept asking me what was wrong, but I just walked mindlessly to my auto rickshaw and sat there and told her to go away. She understood and walked away, as she used to live nearby.

I was so shaken that when I got home and saw my parents, I burst into tears. Because I am the only child, I was never afraid to tell my parents anything, and I told them everything. My dad was pissed. And that's where our revenge started. I have never seen my dad so angry before. He drafted a plan to trap sleezeball with his friends. We will name them Uncle1 and Uncle2.

My dad was friends with our school principal. He visited him when I was attending my school the next day, as if nothing had happened, as they told me not to tell anyone.

Our principal was great and assured us that even though it happened outside the school, they would fully cooperate to trap the sleezeball. At lunch, they called me into the principal's office and told me that Uncle 1 and Uncle 2 would be scattered in the crowd with my English teacher. The school gatekeeper will be near me and my dad will be near the shop where I usually spot the man. They instructed me to walk normally with my friend and avoid them as if they were strangers, but to alert the nearest person as soon as I spotted the sleezeball.

My dad and others were there the whole day, and at 5 pm it was time to execute the plan. As I was instructed, I was walking casually with my friend. She asked me several times because she knew something was odd, but I told her to shush and enjoy the show. And then I spotted the sleezeball actually harrassing my other classmate, and I quickly alerted Uncle1. Initially, it was planned not to hit him and just call the police, but he was caught in the act, so Uncle 1 dragged him away and started beating him. Soon my dad, uncle 2, and the gatekeeper joined him. Then my English teacher handled the situation and dragged the sleezeball inside the school gates and into the principal's office.

My classmates surrounded me with questions, and I gladly answered them and stayed outside the gates with them. After a few minutes, I was called into the principal's office, where I saw the sleezeball. I thought they might ask me some questions, but the principle gave me some apple juice and told me to relax. Sleezeball was there crying, begging to let him go as he would never do it again. He was badly bruised and his clothes were torn. After a few minutes, the police came and took the skeezeball, and he was giving me such a deadly look that it still gives me the chills.

My father and everyone else in the room were so happy and smiling as if there was a celebration and told me that they were so proud of me as I had saved multiple girls that day.

I still don't know the details, but the school took full responsibility for our safety, put that man into jail, and CCTVs were installed within a week, even in a parking lot to cover the area outside the school.",2301,0.99,105,Hour-Ad8095,2022-07-21 12:33:32,w4mkyw,2406,High
NuclearRevenge,The tale of the brazilian punisher,"Hi guys first time posting here and i'm sorry if my spelling isn't perfect (english isn't my first language and i'm on mobile)

Today i bring to you a tale of a man called ""Chico pé de pato""

Francisco Vital da Silva lived in Campo Alegre de Lourdes before he decided to move to São Paulo to get better living conditions 

He got a job as a bricklayer untill he decided to open a bar on the early 80' but it was constantly beeing robbed

One day when he was filling a police report, 5 man broke into his house, stole a bunch of items, and r**** his wife and daughter

He returned to his home-town with his family to recover psychologically from all that mess

After 2 months he returned to São Paulo without his wife and daughter, but this time he wasn't after better life condittions...

He was after blood

He killed more or less than 50 crimminals (including the ones who abused his family) and he would have kept killing more if he hadn't killed an undercover cop wich made him get arrested

He got 6 years in prison, he would have gotten more but thanks to the pressure of 2 thousand people who went to court in his defence he got a small sentence

But their appeal was in vain because on january 27th of 1987 he was stabbed 91 times in jail wich led to his death

And that is the bloody revenge story of a man who just wanted a better life and ended up beiing the nightmare of every criminal in São Paulo, i hope you enjoyed reading this far

Have a nice day folks

NuclearRevenge,Karma generates interest over time,"In the third grade I was an awkward kid, had a mean drunk father, struggled to fit in and make friends, was bullied and shunned by other kids. One of my classmates, let call him Derek, who regularly partook in bullying me showed me kindness one day. Being deprived of kindness or attention so regularly I was putty in his hands. He hanged out with me during recess when I was usually alone, we laughed and talked about girls we like, he even apologized for being an asshole to me.

The reason he was nice to me was because I had brought a very popular, expensive batman action figure to school with me to pass the time since I was alone mostly. I saved allowance and mowed lawns for two months to buy that toy. Everyone wanted one. By the end of the day he asked me if he could lend the action figure and like the naive, socially inept kid I was I trusted him with it. The deal was to return it the following morning. I went home so happy,completely fooled, I never suspected a thing.

The following day he completely ignored me, when I tried to talk to him he acted like I was crazy. When I asked him to return the action figure he simply said, ""you never gave me any batman, maybe you imagined it"" and when I persisted he threatened to beat my ass. When I complained to my teacher I was told that it was my own fault for bringing toys to school, I was afraid they would involve my father so I dropped it. I couldn't let my father know or I would be called a pussy and have my ass beat and punished for the next two weeks.

Whats worse is Derek told all the girls that I confided to him about fancying that I lusted after them and that I wanked to them. I was a social outcast before that but at least I was tolerated, but after his smear campaign with the girls I was a leper, people wouldn't even look me in the eyes, not even the teachers. Kids started throwing stones at me, sabotaged and vandalised my property, it was hell. I did nothing about it but cry, I was just a weak willed kid after all but to this day I wish I'd bit someones ear off or something, anything in retaliation.


After a while the bullying died down, I focused on my studies and started getting good grades. Derek started talking to me again but I ignored him completely. Sometimes he would repeat, ""why are you being such a baby, you didn't give me anything, you imagined it.""


By the end of the year we moved houses and I transferred to another school not far away. Things were much better there, I finally had friends and I was not as naive anymore so I was not as easily targeted. But I was still mostly me and still got picked on now and then. Over the years I became somewhat of a delinquent and in high school I got into regular fights, I may have been overcompensating for the lack of a spine I had in my younger years.


I bar tended in night clubs, hotels, and cruise liners in my early twenties,this helped me a lot to be more socially adept and to understand social dynamics and human nature. I finished trade school and qualified as an electrician and later as a plumber, i know, water and electricity, but believe it or not, I thought it was ingenius at the time. I started my own business, developed a reputation for excellent workmanship in my local area and did well for myself.


When I was 29, I'm 36 now, I received a call out at 2 in the morning for a flooding emergency at a local residence. When I got there the place was a mess, water was jetting out of a burst pipe and electrical equipment was shorted, it was highly dangerous. The living room floor was caved in due to a sink hole. I was met by the wife, let's call her Jane, hysterical and beside herself, she somehow thought that she was responsible which I found odd, I assured her that it couldn't possibly be her fault. 



He arrived not 5 minutes later, his demeanor was irate, he didn't greet or shake my hand when I offered, I recognized him immediately, Derek from all those years ago. He demanded to know why I have not begun fixing the issue yet, I was professional, told him what I'd told the wife in terms of costs but I hid the written quote in my vehicle. I told him who I was and acted happy to see him, assured him that he was in good hands. After a while of arguing with his wife he seemed to calm down and joked around with me, I knew I had fooled him.


We talked about our carreers, kids, our school days, I gave him tips and fake recommendations, we got along great, his trust was easy to gain. He must have thought of me as a complete sucker. I assured him that he was in good hands and this would be fixed in no time. I was careful not to start any actual work on the property, doing the smallest thing would make me responsible for all of it. Derek left after an hour or so and his wife stayed behind. I started my revenge.



When I was doing my assessment I noticed that most of the building did not comply with city regulation and did not adhere to the registered and approved plans. There were multiple safety hazards and all plumbing and electrical work were completed by unqualified and uncertified people in an attempt to save money. Also, the pipe in question had been leeking for a few weeks at least, getting worse by the day and finally causing disaster, which means their water bill would be astronomical at the end of the month unless a qualified plumber endorses a rebate with the municipality.


I called my contact at the city, let's call him Donovan and notified him of all the regulatory violations, safety hazards and non city compliant installations on the property, I also told him of the possible water bill. He promised to be there the next day. I immediately started photographing and documenting. The following morning my contact was there at 10, he had a field day. He informed Derek's wife of the calamity that was to come. They would be forced to tear down all the building additions, remove all the uncertified plumbing and wiring installations, have the plans re approved, and start from scratch, which is an estimated loss of approximately 950 thousand. 


Derek was there in minutes, he was livid. He quickly threatened legal action but Donovan simply told him that he had more than enough photograph evidence to have the property declared invalid within a week if Derek did not comply in writing. Donovan reminded Derek that he does this for a living and that the city has more legal resources to waste money on.


I left Derek an invoice for my time just to smear salt in the would and took my leave. Later he called me and called me every name under the sun, I remained silent and he hung up. He went on a Facebook rant about me, which was a bad idea, all of the community stood up for me and it started story telling competition where all kinds of people revealed stories of u savory things Derek did to them in the past. Apparently Derek has always been an asshole, he never changed.


One day he called me and asked to meet, he sounded defeated and depressed so I decided to meet and see what's up. I met him at a local busy convenience store. I know better than to take Derek the weasel at face value, so noticed quickly when he layed his phone screen down on the table, I knew he may be recording the conversation. He apologized for his behavior which surprised me, and told me that this whole dilemma has all but bankrupted him. He told me he took out a loan for the building additions and cut corners to save money, that everyone does it. He showed me the water bill which was nearly 80 thousand, a problem easily erased with a qualified plumbers signature and endorsement. I refused. He got irate again.


Then he asked me: ""why did you do this to me, I know I was a dick to you at when we were kids but I don't deserve to have my and my wife's live ruined because of mistakes I made when I was a kid. What kind of person are you? You told me I was in good hands, i trusted you, you assured me you would help me, then you stabbed me in the back. You quoted me only a few hundred and told me not to worry""


I replied: ""I said no such thing.""


Derek: ""stop lying, you told me that it would cost a few hundred maybe less, I heard you say it, you promised to help me, gave me recommendations. Why are you doing this to me.""


Seneca: ""Derek, you must have imagined it.""


I looked him in the eye, he knew exactly why I said that, they same thing he told me almost 20 years ago. I repeated just to drive it home.


Seneca: ""you're being a baby, I never quoted you for anything, you imagined it.


He knew I was destroying him financially because of a batman action figure he stole from me 20 years ago, I could see it in his eyes, but he couldn't bring himself to say it. His expression was a mixture of astonishment and disgust. I looked him dead in the eyes for a few seconds for effect then got up and left. I slept like a baby that night, and had a goofy smile all week after. 


He tried calling a few times but sent him a text stating that further harassment will be met with legal action. Derek, you know what your real name is, and what mine is, if in future you read this and realise how I screwed you over, remember how costly that little batman action figure was to you after years of accumulated interest in karma. The look of despair on your face when you realise why you are ruined was delicious, I cackled maniacly on the drive home from that convenience store. It was time for you to pay the piper.


And if you think this will help you legally go ahead and try, it won't, so don't waste your time. Or rather do, waste as much time and money, I welcome being even more of a financial inconvenience to your life.

NuclearRevenge,Old fart gets his revenge,"This story was from my grandpa who knew this guy when he was growing up in the 1960s.

So we’ll call this guy Henry he was old as shit when this story took place. In New Mexico in the early 1960s Henry owned a decent sized ranch. Now Henry was a badass motherfucker, in his younger days he fought in WW1 and was rumored to be a gunfighter in the last days of the wild west, he was also rumored to be associated with the Mafia in Chicago in the 1920s when he “went to college”. 

Henry had about 15 ranch hands and 3 sons (he had lots of cattle and land). His youngest son was in the Army at this point in time and the other two had other jobs. A lot of his ranch hands were black and some were refugees fleeing racial violence in the east at that time. 

So one evening his guys were attacked and beaten up and a couple of his cows were killed by unknown attackers but it was pretty obvious it was the KKK. After assessing the situation he couldn’t really do much and the police were useless as the town police force was pretty much useless as it had like 2 guys. These attacks continued for a couple weeks no one was beat up but some cows were killed and fences and stuff were destroyed. Henry received a note saying that he had to get rid of all his black workers by the end of the week or they were gonna burn down his ranch and kill everyone and everything. So he kinda said fuck this and called his son who just happened to be on leave.

His son and a couple of his army buddies were on leave and they pretty much had nothing else to do but come over. He was also really good friends with a biker gang in the area (who he probably helped hide bodies on his land). So they came over and helped him prepare. No he didn’t want the police involved as he was an old fuck and did things the old fashioned way. So he sent a couple ranch hands over to town to get drunk and distract to police and he would bail them out in the morning. Basically it was 2 underpaid cops trying to contain the drunken madness in a bar in a small town in the middle of the NM desert.

 So one night the klan pulled up ready to trash the place. The remaining ranch hands were having a bonfire and seemed completely oblivious to their impending doom. (They were strapped tho). Henry had his son and his buddies and the bikers hidden in the barns and sheds ready to attack. When the KKK showed up they had gasoline cans and some weapons there were about 10 of them. 

Basically it plays out that the cowboys all acted drunk until the bikers/soldiers showed up and surrounded the KKK and then they pulled their guns out.

Now I never heard if anyone was killed or if he just gave them a good scare but there hasn’t been a single racial incident or animal murdered in that town since then. Also Henry died a couple years later from cancer prolly cuz he smoked and dipped for like 60 years because it was healthy back then. Anyway grandpa was cool and knew a lot of badasses like Henry.",1830,0.97,59,pimp780,2022-07-08 20:46:17,vuqlus,1889,High
NuclearRevenge,My grandmother almost killed my mother's first fiancé,"My grandmother told me this story and I wanted to share

This all happened in 1985 so this was before security cameras were a ""house hold"" thing plus this happened in bumfuck georgia

My grandmother (Clara) told me that when my mom (Angela) turned 19 she got engaged to a man (Dick (his actual name btw)). Clara noticed that he was very controlling i.e she couldnt use a phone (the land line) and he forbid her from going to family events.

Clara's final straw was when my mom called her in the middle of the night crying saying she couldnt do it anymore and that he had been beating her. By this point they had been together for almost 2 years and had my older brother.

Clara told my mom to go to my great grandfathers house and stay there but tell Dick that she was going to her house.

My mom did as she was asked and Clara waited for him. He eventually came in the middle of the night yelling that Angela needed to come home and stop acting like a child.

Clara told Dick that she was inside. He went in and Clara came in behind him and hit him over the head with a bat that she had set beside the inside of the door. Dick fell to the floor and Clara hit him several times in the legs and arms, breaking one of his arms and fracturing a rib. When she was done she told him to never come near her daughter or he would be in a ditch next.

He never came back. pretty sure he burned my moms stuff but she didnt care.",5083,0.99,160,SilverRose223,2022-06-22 09:27:32,vi6j7z,5243,High

LifeProTips,"LPT: Buy an old phone off eBay or CraigsList, keep it empty of all personal data and info, and carry it with you on vacation or when traveling in unfamiliar places.","If you get mugged, hand that one over. Nobody ever expects someone to have a dummy phone so they’ll take it and go, leaving you with your real phone. My brother was just mugged recently in Honolulu and gave them an old iPhone 8 he paid $30 for and they took off. He went back to his hotel with his actual phone perfectly safe and in his possession, and since it has one of those phone wallet things he still has all his credit cards too

I don’t know where he got the idea, but his experience convinced me to do the same. Grabbed an old iPhone off eBay with a cracked screen for $25. Putting an old case on it and keeping it with me when I travel now.

ETA 1: I don’t know exactly which part of town he was in. I could guess based on my own past experiences but they’d only be guesses. I’ll ask him next time we talk.

ETA 2: Honolulu is a great town, but it’s also still a real American city, and yes they have crime too. My brother got mugged. It happens. This is the real world, not Disneyland. I’m not sure why that is so difficult for some to understand.

ETA 3: If you don’t care for the advice, don’t use it. As someone who travels a lot and has both witnessed and been the victim of petty street crime, I plan to. It’s a low cost, low effort way to hedge against losing something very valuable to me. It worked in my brother’s case, so it clearly isn’t just a myth.

ETA 4: I had never encountered the idea until he told me about it. Apparently it has been a thing for some time. I don’t claim that he invented it. His experience was simply the first I’d heard of it. Let that be that.",6967,0.88,473,Tiki-Jedi,2024-11-12 19:25:34,1gq19xo,7440,High

LifeProTips,"LPT: Price compare your online shopping effectively, including on used stuff with no good keywords, by using AI photo recognition (Google Lens et al.)","Two applications of this tip: 



1. If you are perusing Craigslist / Facebook Marketplace or any of the second hand marketplace and are trying to figure out the original pricing of something -- even if there aren't enough keywords to do a search (perhaps the seller just listed ""Sleeper couch"" with no other info of brand or model) ... Use Google Lens to do a search on the picture of the item.   
It will very often identify the specific model - back even a few months ago, Google would identify other similar looking objects, but it's gotten really good at being very precise in its searches. Game changer for price comparison tasks!

  
2. If you are on a large shopping site (like the one that that's with an ""a"" and ends with ""zon"") and are considering an item that is likely to be manufactured non-exclusively by a Chinese factory -- you know other A\*\*zon sellers will also have this item, but probably with different keywords and you may never find them.  
Use Google Lens on the picture of the item and let Google Lens search -- this works particularly well because items manufactured non-exclusively by Chinese factories tend to be promoted by sellers by using handout photos given by the manufacturers, so they actually all use the same few pictures across all listings. 

  
How to use Google Lens?

In Chrome, you can right-click a photo to find the option ""Google Lens"" -- this will enable the feature and you can hover over the image to pick a specific item within the picture to have Google Lens focus on (particularly useful in second-hand marketplace contexts where the item being sold is often presented in a room with other items nearby)



Note 1: I don't work for Google and have no stakes in the success of this feature. But I have been shopping for some stuff on second hand marketplaces and Google Lens has helped me establishing whether folks are pricing fairly -- lol at people trying to resell cumbersome furniture for N dollars (""Buy my billion-ton whatchamakalit for 100 dollars -- pick up at a 4 floor walkup"" , when it turns out that the current price of the whatchamakalit is 120 dollars and comes with free shipping on the original retailer)

LifeProTips,LPT: a pumice stone will make an old toilet bowl gleam like new,"If your house has a toilet which is old enough to vote, it probably works fine but still looks old. The bowl may have a permanent ring around the water-line. It may have a few spots that always get re-stained soon after you clean it with a toilet brush. You've probably thought about replacing the whole thing which is a significant effort.

The trick to cleaning the bowl is using a Pumice Stone and Acidic cleaner. Both are inexpensive. A pumice stone costs a couple of dollars from your local department store, available in the beauty/foot section. A bottle of acid toilet bowl cleaner costs less than 10 dollars.

Simply scrub the ~~surface~~ *stained spots* of the bowl with the pumice stone. As you're scrubbing, you can feel where the porcelain has scale build-up just by how the pumice slides. The pumice is a lot softer than the porcelain glaze, so it's very unlikely to damage the toilet. After you've finished scrubbing with the pumice stone, coat the bowl the acid cleaner and let it sit for a while. At this point, the bowl will be gleaming. Repeat if you notice you've missed any spots.

This cleaning method can save you a lot of effort of replacing the entire toilet.",0,0.23,6,ChiefStrongbones,2024-11-11 21:28:13,1gpbiak,6,High

LifeProTips,LPT How to detach/decompress from toxic/bullying coworkers when I come home?,"I know the most obvious answer is to leave but for many reasons that is not possible at this time. I plan to leave within the next 18 months but literally cannot at this moment so please don't suggest this. I also cannot move offices at this time either, I am purely looking for strategies for how to destress/disconnect when I am at home.

Context:  
  
I am a child protection social worker and absolutely love my physical job however the toxicness and bullying of the workplace is quite literally traumatizing me and destroying me from the inside out. My manager is a literal psychopath who has a history of substantiated workplace bullying (5 years ago and not against me) she is sneaky, manipulative and unrelenting. Past disciplinary action has just taught her how to perpetrate her abuse in a smarter way so that technicalities stop her from being able to be accused of bullying again.  
  
She became my boss earlier in the year (after she got my boss moved to another district) and my mental health has steadily deteriorated since. She makes it her mission in life to destroy anyone in the workplace who see's through her facade and as well as getting my old manager moved put so much pressure on two of my previous team members that they quit. I am the last person standing who she know's see's through her crap and she has hyperfixated on getting rid of me since. 

All year I have kept track of her bullying behaviors and misconduct and after many discussions with my office manager (her boss) I have recently moved to a new team. Whilst I am on a new team I am still in the same office as her and she has enormous sway over my new manager and the office manager. Everyday she finds new ways to exert control, micromanage and gaslight me and I feel like I am going insane. 

I now dread going to work despite loving my job and am experiencing enormous amounts of anxiety and depression at home as well as work (I am seeing a regular GP and psychologist and have amazing friends and family to help support as well). Despite the extensive support I still feel like I am drowning and wasting away in misery and stress. 

I would love a way to figure out a way to separate myself from her influence over me while I am at home and isolate this to just being at work. Any advise would be extremely appreciated, I am really struggling.

I am not trying to sell anything to you, just here to help which in other hand would help me aswell, I took a lot of time on this list! And some products have aff links, not trying to hide anything!

Let me explain my intentions a bit more

I found a kitchen essentials spreadsheet list online on reddit and thought it was amazing! However the list was over 5 years old and the prices were wrong and the list was not up to date, so i thought to myself, why not recreate the same list, with better pictures, colors and prices? So i made it! I don’t take much credit for it as it was someone else’s Idea, however we live in a free world, and taking ideas is from other smart people, and making them better is what pushes us forward as an society.

The products are hand-compiled (95 items), and also used product recommendations from America's Test Kitchen and Serious Eats to come up with three different options for each item, at three different price points. So there are currently 279 individual items with prices and links to purchase.

If you spot anything I have missed, feel free to let me know and I will add it.

I added some new little pictures as well. 

Next I will be adding some descriptions as to why each item is considered essential, or basically why I think it deserves a spot in your kitchen. I will try to keep my bias out of this.

LifeProTips,LPT: Putting your lights on a timer can be better than an alarm clock.,"This is something I've experimented with myself. I've had a hard time maintaining a good early morning schedule, and eventually I found setting up a soft light on a timer to activate 30 minutes to an hour before you actually need to wake up is incredibly helpful for ensuring that you wake up alert and rested, especially in winter months.

This is because your brain uses light to regulate your circadian rhythm, which determines your sleep patterns and, if interrupted, can leave you feeling fatigued and unrested all day long. By setting the lights in your sleeping space on a timer, you can take advantage of this mechanism in order to trigger your brain's natural wake-up response, either paired with a traditional alarm or on its own, increasing your mental clarity and focus early in the morning and improving your whole day as a result. 

It also has the benefit of more precisely regulating your sleep patterns, as your brain will always attach itself to the perceived day/night cycle of your environment. So unless you sleep in an area with no windows, your sleep cycle will necessarily vary over the year. By using a timed light in your sleeping space, you gain more control over that pattern and can become more consistent and evenly regulated.

It's important that you use the right kind of light for this. Use a soft or dim light that illuminates the space enough to move around but which won't wake you immediately, and try to match it to the color of sunlight. A pale white, very pale blue, or very pale yellow is best.

The goal is not to be woken by the Light, but rather to trick your brain into thinking the sun is rising at a consistent, set time, thus triggering the end of your sleep cycle and allowing you to wake up in a consistent manner if a normal alarm clock isn't quite enough for you. Give it a try for a week or so and see if it works.",1285,0.96,87,Valirys-Reinhald,2024-11-07 07:39:06,1glqn1e,1372,High

LifeProTips,LPT “It’s okay if people are wrong.”,"One decision that has dramatically  improved my life in recent years is that it’s okay if other people are wrong. I don’t need to correct them, and I’ll never change anyone’s mind anyway. Deciding that, and remembering it in the moment, made a huge difference in so many areas of my life. For starters, I’m not nearly as stressed, angry, or afraid all the time. 

Eventually, I made the next logical leap and realized that if it’s okay for other people to be wrong, then it’s okay if I’m wrong too.
There’s a good chance that what any of us think we know isn’t even true. It’s far more likely that our “trusted” sources are either misinformed or are simply lying. It’s nearly impossible to find out the full story about anything without seeking it out.

If I see a clip of someone on TV say something that sounds insane, or someone quoting someone else, I seek out the full statement to understand the context. This is especially true if I keep hearing the same thing quoted over and over. 

In other words, I try to avoid basing my opinions on the opinions of others. Because when it comes down to it, my side may not be as good as I think it is, and the other side may not be as evil or stupid as my TV says they are. 

Most people are honestly trying to do the right thing, and none of us has the full picture. So if half of the country disagree with me, maybe it’s worth trying to understand why.

LifeProTips,"LPT if you get a puppy, expose them triggering sounds as early as possible to avoid anxiety","We got a puppy during COVID. To avoid him becoming an anxious dog, we played triggering noises over our speakers while he was in a safe, calm setting (sirens, fireworks, etc.). Last week he calmly watched fireworks with us that were happening virtually right outside the balcony. Very grateful that we did this since we live in a city where fireworks often go off in our neighbourhood at random times!

Edit: I quickly wrote this before falling asleep last night, so I'll add some more info/context: We used Youtube playlists of triggering sounds that are designed for desensitizing dogs. We played them while we were all calmly relaxing in the living room and continued doing what we were doing, showing our indifference to the noise. We monitored our pup to make sure it wasn't frightening him, which it didn't. Thunderstorms did frighten him at first, but we showed our indifference which taught him not to fear them. We also did other things to help him become a more confident dog, like taking him everywhere with us (before he had his shots we would carry him around), exposing him to traffic sounds, strange people, different environments, etc. The earlier you can do all this, the better.

I previously arranged my plants by their water needs, but that didn’t work well due to their different sunlight requirements. Now, by simply keeping track of my thirstiest plant, I’ve improved my habit of watering all my plants at the right time.

My method is to place the plant that needs the most frequent watering in the most visible spot in my home and keep an eye on it. This reminds me when it needs watering and also stimulates me to check on the other plants.

I hope this method helps you if you love plants but find it difficult to care for them.

edit: Redditors started calling it the indicator plant, so I will refer to it that way as well. From my research, I learned that the term “indicator plant” is used in agriculture for similar methods to analyze soil, serving more scientific purposes.

3. No sharing/posting to drama subs - Anybody cross posting any threads to the drama causing subs (subreddit drama, any of the SRS, just anything to increase the drama in a thread) will be banned. That just won't be tolerated at any level. Don't tattle on the mods of other subs here either.

4. No revenge submissions - No ""How to get even"" at all, not in submissions, not in comments.

5. No threadjacking or comment qualifiers - Stay focused on OP's problem. If you disagree with someone else's advice, offer some advice of your own with a top level comment instead of debating. If you agree with someone's advice and have nothing to add, just upvote it.

6. No misogyny, misandry, racism, religious intolerance, or similar - Respect one another, even those you disagree with. We're all equal here.

12. Nothing about missing persons - Don't ask about how to track someone down or find someone you used to know.

13. No stand-alone jokes. A joke with legitimate advice is fine, but not by itself.

","I’m almost 30 and started working early. At 15, I joined my dad's tobacconist business, but by 23, it closed, and I found myself in the restaurant and fast food industry until 27. Then, I became an office clerk in property management, where I've worked for three years. However, my salary of €1,200 a month is not enough to live independently, buy a house, or start a family. In Italy, supporting a medium-low lifestyle requires at least €2,500-€3,000 monthly. Even with extra hours, I’d only earn €1,800.

I need to make a decision since I can’t stay in this position if I want to achieve my goals. My main aim is to balance work and personal life. I’m considering entrepreneurship but worry about being available 24/7 compared to a regular job where I can disconnect after shifts.

Here are some paths I’m contemplating:

1. Stay in my current field: Become a certified condominium administrator, aiming for €50k annually with flexible hours (3 hours daily and 2 meetings weekly).

2.Change sectors: Work as a restaurant manager (I have a contact) for €35k annually (6 hours daily, 6 days a week), but with 24/7 availability except at night.

3. Open a tattoo studio: Since I'm good at drawing, I could start this venture with an initial income of €35k annually, working 4 hours daily without availability issues.

4. Other options?

I've lost all of my friends. Every last one. Part of this im ok with, because a lot of them bullied me into insecurity in the 1st place. But solitude and silence has driven me totally insane. Don't feel comfortable talking to my family. So I've gone months without human interaction or conversation and every moment of every day I spend now hating myself. I replay memories of things I've done and said for the past 10 years, alot in my early 20s and some as recently as last week. But I can feel my blood boiling with each memory. I want someone to beat the shit out of me for being so stupid, desperate, making people uncomfortable. I tell myself every day I deserve this pain.

I've watched videos on self forgiveness, but I don't feel it's possible when I've torched my reputation publicly. People used to respect me. Not anymore. Even if I forgive myself I don't feel it's stronger than all the people who think ""whew I'm glad I never have to talk to that kid again"".

I've been on meds, off, with 5 different therapists, lived in different states. The results have been the same every time: me making a fool out of myself and people I really care about dissapearing. Why would I forgive myself? What does this mean for the rest of my life? Do I belong in a mental institution? Because I don't feel welcome in the real world anymore.",19,0.87,38,throw77_away,2024-11-11 01:06:17,1gomgy2,57,High
needadvice,Advice on Burnout/Cortisol Addiction/Depression???? :/,"Hi, and if you're taking the time to read this, thank you so much, I appreciate it!

I'm a 17 y/o Hispanic American female currently in my senior year of pretty intense college prep high school; I have ADHD, as well as OCD and Anxiety, all of which I have struggled with all four years. Despite my mental health struggles, I have been able to keep my 4.0, be in the top 10% of my class, stay involved in extracurriculars, and do pretty well on testing, which has given me the chance to apply to some very competitive colleges. 

  
I was told my senior year would be the ""fun"" year, so that's kind of what I've been holding onto through tough times in high school; that soon, I'll be in my senior year and will finally be able to let loose and have fun and spend more time with my friends. But so far, my senior year has been anything but. I'm in 4 APs, doing research, leading student government, and MUN. I'm at meetings most lunches which I hate because lunch is when I get to see my friends. 



At the beginning of this year, I thought, ""I just gotta lock in really hard for these first two months, submit all of my college apps, and then I'll be done and I can finally relax after."" So I did...initially. I was waking up on the weekends at 6 am to work, and I'd work all day and seemingly never finish my work; everything takes me longer (thanks, ADHD!) But even then, I still felt fulfilled and motivated to wake up early and work. When Nov 1 rolled around, I didn't feel the immense sense of relief I'd expected when I submitted my ED/EA applications...just fear for the results/decisions. I've applied to 9/14 of my colleges and have the last couple of deadlines on November 15th, so I know I should be feeling a little more relieved, but I've been feeling so...unmotivated... sad, and overall down. 



I'm usually motivated to study because I want to do well on assignments and, honestly because I'm usually interested in the material and like learning. But th se past couple of weeks I just...can't. I spent HOURS doing literally nothing and trying to build up the energy/motivation to study. And even when I try to sit down to do work or study, I always get sleepy! I'm SO TIRED all of the time. Like just today I took like 2, 4 hour naps. I have a lot I want to get done (and get off my plate so I can try to relax), so I try waking up early on weekends, but I end up wasting most of the time and just can't do my work. This makes me feel even unmotivated, guilty, and mad at myself because I have very high expectations for myself, and when I can't reach them, I feel like a failure (which ik isn't great.) 



I've been getting less and less sleep, seeing my friends less and less, biting my nails more, and not making time to work out or eat as healthy as I would like. But despite this, I'm also not even getting any work done/being productive, so I just feel lost in an endless cycle of homework, tests, and application deadlines, all while not seeing my friends. My grades haven't started to slip yet, but I'm worried at the rate things are going because I CAN'T find it in me to want to work. Even sadder I think I've lost some of the passion and curiosity I usually feel towards learning. I'm in AP Physics (which I hate, omg, like I have never been so simultaneously uninterested and terrible at a subject), and the results of the recent election \*cough cough\* have been very stressful on my family and me, so that could be contributing to some of the burnout? Idk. I don't usually post here on Reddit, but I have literally no idea what to do. I think this must be burnout, right? Or like a cortisol addiction? If it is, what do I do?! I want to be happy, feel less stressed and enjoy my last year of high school w my friends. And I really want to feel the excitement learning things in school used to bring me, but I don't know how to anymore. 

If you somehow read all of this, thank you so much; I know it was a lot. 

I would really really appreciate some advice on what I should do

needadvice,I'm completely lost in life and feel utterly hopeless,"26 and no idea what to do with my life.

I've been completely lost my entire life. I'm currently a dishwasher at Chipotle, and tbh I hate my life. I made good grades in school, graduated with honors, but I have severe mental health issues that prevent me from being successful at university. I went for 6 years, had a nervous breakdown, and can't go back until i pay off my loans. And at this point, I can't afford to support myself while going to school. I can barely handle working full time, and i can't handle school full time. Even if I try trade school... how am I supposed to make money to pay bills? I have no savings no car. I'm out of state with my grandparents because i could no longer afford to support myself, and I'm away from my friends family. I have no qualifications or experience above entry level. The only job that hasn't destroyed my mental health is as a janitor. I can't afford therapy and can barely afford medication.

No careers appeal to me. None that are feasible for my lot in life. I've looked at all the trades, and they all sound horrible to me. I changed majors 3 times in uni and even now i dont really know what i want to do.

I hate my life. I try to help grateful, but I'm lost and stuck and see no way out. It makes me want to die. At this rate, I won't ever be able to have a family or house of my own. I won't ever have a career. I don't see why I shouldn't kill myself. Life has become unbearable, and it always has been.

I have a bunch of hobbies but that doesn't translate to a career. I do photography, a little music, art, writing, and lately physics and philosophy. But I don't have access to physics education. Philosophy doesn't make a good career. I've tried sharing my creative work online but it's gotten minimal reception, I'm not good enough to make a career. I can't afford professional grade equipment. I can't afford qualifications. I thought about trying to get comp sci certs online but apparently thats a bad route too. Also ive never given a shit about programming before, and I still don't.

I feel like I'm trapped in life and I want out. I don't want to just be on this earth to wash fucking dishes and take out trash. But there's no escape from this. Oh and I'm not qualified for military because I have PTSD from an extremely abusive childhood, depression, anxiety, adhd, autism, and a severe problem with authority figures. And scoliosis and a bad knee that gives out.

I find no meaning in my life anymore. I've lost hope for my future. I want to sleep and never wake up to this nightmare again.",5,0.86,12,smooshed_napkin,2024-11-10 17:59:26,1goesqz,17,High

Hello everyone,
I'm terribly sorry if this is the wrong sub to ask about wisdom teeth. However, I wanted to quickly get a few opinions on whether I should have my wisdom teeth removed.

I only have two upper wisdom teeth. Both are fully impacted, but not causing any issues. (By impacted, I mean that they are under the gums. They aren't growing sideways/horizontally into anything. They are vertically impacted. Still, if they decide to erupt at some point, I do not have any space for them.)

I spoke with an oral surgeon, and they basically told me that I could have them taken out or that I could leave them and see what happens.

Based on your experience, what do you believe would be the best decision to make?

needadvice,Feeling Left Behind and Stuck at Home While My Friends Move Forward,"Hey everyone, just need to get this off my chest and maybe get some advice.

Lately, I’ve been feeling really left behind compared to my friends. They’re all moving on to newer things, like gaming on PS5s or high-end PCs, while I’m still here with my PS4. Gaming has always been a huge part of my life—it’s one of the main ways I connect with friends, relax, and feel like I’m part of something. But now, I feel out of sync with everyone else.

On top of that, I recently decided to change up my wardrobe and got rid of clothes that didn’t feel like “me” anymore. Now, I’m left with only a few pieces of clothing. I thought this would help me get a fresh start, but my mom doesn’t seem interested in getting me anything new. It’s frustrating because she just got my older brother a new PC for university, so I know it’s not necessarily a money issue. When I bring it up, though, she just ignores me or brushes it off.

What’s been making this all feel worse is that I’m currently grounded. I’m stuck at home while my friends are out having fun, and my mom even made me miss a Halloween party I was really looking forward to. I feel like my options are just so limited now—I can either study, game on my outdated setup, or stay in. It’s getting hard not to feel left behind or like I’m just stuck while everyone else moves forward.

It’s not just about keeping up for the sake of it; it’s about not feeling left out and wanting something that brings me happiness, especially now that I can’t even go out. If anyone has tips on how I could get through to my mom or just feel less stuck, I’d really appreciate it.

TL;DR: Feeling left behind while friends upgrade to PS5s and gaming PCs, and I’m still on my PS4 with only a few pieces of clothing after clearing out my wardrobe. Currently grounded, missed a Halloween party I was looking forward to, and don’t have much to do besides study, go out (when I’m allowed), and game, which I love. My mom ignores me when I ask about upgrading or getting new clothes, and it’s hard not to feel stuck. Looking for advice.",1,1.0,1,No_Wing_8222,2024-11-04 13:23:57,1gjmrkq,2,Medium
needadvice,I need an advice over complicated money issues between flatmates. ,"I need some advice on a complicated living situation I’m dealing with. Here’s the context and sorry for the long text:

I used to live with three girls: Sarah, Hannah, and Paula. Sarah and I had rooms of similar size; she paid €360 while I paid €410 from the beginning i moved in. Hannah paid €340, and Paula, who had the largest room with balcony, paid €650. From the start, Hannah (who moved in a year after me) complained that her rent price was too high considering her room size smaller than us and felt it unfair that she paid only €20 less than Sarah. This was an ongoing conflict from the beginning she moved in.

When Sarah moved out, we decided to set the rent for her room to €380, which seemed fair to me. (Worth noting: Sarah used to justify her lower rent by saying she’d lived there for three years and handled communications with the landlord.) After Sarah left, Hannah suggested lowering her rent to €320 and setting Sarah’s old room at €400 for the new tenant. I was initially against this idea but gave in after tiring of the endless arguments with her.

With the new arrangement, the rent became: €380 for my room, €400 for Sarah’s old room, €320 for Hannah, and €650 for Paula’s. Eventually, this new girl, Isabel took over Sarah’s. Isabel agreed to pay €400 from the start, as we didn’t mention the previous €380 price.

We have two bathrooms: one shared by me and Paula, and the other by Hannah and Isabel. A month later, the landlord announced a rent increase of €62.5 per person. Paula told me that paying €712.5 for her room was too much and unreasonable. I proposed that I take my own bathroom and increase my rent to €480 (€380 + €100), while Paula would pay €675 (€650 + €25) instead.

Paula asked if she should discuss this with the others, and I told her to speak only with Isabel. I felt Hannah didn’t have the right to decide after previously reducing her own rent without proper justification and asking anyone. A few days later, Paula agreed to the plan and told me she has discussed it with Isabel. 

However, after some time, Isabel expressed that she wasn’t comfortable sharing a bathroom with two people while I had my own. I explained the background issues with Hannah and suggested two options: either I go back to paying €440 and share the bathroom with Paula, or Isabel could revert to €440 (€380 + €62.5), and Hannah would pay €400 (her €340 + €62.5). If Hannah had a problem with that, she could choose to leave (she also had broken so many rules in the house, which eventually both Sarah and I complained about it to the landlord and landlord agreed to not renew her contract, but since I didn’t wanna make her homeless i let landlord renewing her contract and that’s why i have a beef with her and really don’t care about her opinion)

Isabel thought it would be best to discuss this as a group, which I agreed to, but I’m certain Hannah will argue over the money again and make huge drama with me in an aggressive way.

Am I being reasonable with these suggestions? What should I do in this situation? I feel like Isabel and Hannah kinda expect me to pay more for having private bathroom but I can easily justify like Sarah, since now I’m responsible for the house stuff with landlord and also i’m living in this house longer than anyone. I feel like since Hannah wants to make the situation complicated for me due to personal issues, she has motivated Isabel to make this meeting and force me to pay more and make drama over money just like the way she did since the beginning of moving in. (I have to mention i’m kinda close to landlord and her daughter, and they trust me but they don’t get involve in these stuff. I have managed all the house stuff with landlord for months, like renewal of contract for everyone, dealing with handing rent stuff etc and i feel like as a old tenant of this house, i have more rights than two girls who just moved in some months ago) ",1,1.0,4,Senior-Local-1157,2024-11-04 13:05:05,1gjmav6,5,High

needadvice,Need advice on Europe trip and change of plans regarding visiting a friend,"Advice on upcoming European trip and visiting a friend

Hello,

I am going to Europe for a month in November. My plan is Iceland, Denmark, and Switzerland. My Norwegian friend was gonna come to Switzerland for a couple days to hangout.

I get a call at work and can’t answer. So, I message him and he says unfortunately he can’t visit Switzerland. His contract at work didn’t get extended and the next one doesn’t begin til December. And because of this he has to go back to Norway to stay with friends and family. We are both disappointed as we looked forward to this trip.

I have always wanted to visit Norway and have told him this. There was even a post on Instagram that said the first person on send list has to take you to Norway, to which he responded: “I have to be in Norway first and foremost!” And he also said: “He did say: “just staying with family and friends, so unsure how practical it is. I will give you the route when I’ve got it.”

I responded: “I feel like if I don’t take opportunities now while I have the chance, they might slip through my fingers.”

And he said: “it’s true; very valid point! I’ll get you the schedule” 🙂

Am I trying too hard to make this happen? It seems like he is open to me visiting since he will give me the route/schedule of where he’ll be! Or should I forget about it?

Thanks for any advice! I am leaning heavily on visiting him!

For context: I went to visit him in the Netherlands last year and we have been talking as friends since August 2020 consistently. More recently since after my trip last year we talk on the phone occasionally! ",2,1.0,1,diglet95,2024-10-29 11:36:32,1gez07b,3,Medium

needadvice,I've read studies saying that performance in things such as the workplace correlate almost exclusively with static traits like intelligence: I feel unmotivated and scared I'll never be able to meaningfully improve because of this,"
I have OCD and I struggle not to think about certain things. One particular fixation of mine is the idea of never being able to get past flaws of mine or be able to improve. For example, I am in education, I am terrified of the idea that if I had bad grades, I would be unable to fix this. Or, if I graduated, I would not be able to get good enough at the job I wanted to do.


I find myself feeling scared and daunted, like, every time I encounter a problem in education or the possibility of not reaching a future career, I wonder ""Can this get better? Can this change?"" and I am terrified of the answer being no. A study I found suggested experience doesn't improve decision making, which also scares me. The idea that I could never actually improve in my ability to make meaningful decisions in my life.



Here are articles that are examples of what I mean.

They also are so obsessed with knowing what goes on in my life but makes sure I never get to know about theirs (but of course the other friends do) and they act dry when I try to initiate conversations and know stuff about them. Weird cuz she considers me one of her close friends.

If I ever make a joke back or make fun of them (without any malicious intent, I only would  do the same as my friend because I used to think matching the energy would make me feel less upset) they blow up at me, and say hurtful comments, and if I say anything back, they ignore me, and they can ignore me for how long they want.

Which they take as an opportunity to get closer without me because they think nee friends means me dropping them.

needadvice,How do I move forward from screwing up a dream career change? ,"This is really very embarrassing for me. 

I have come so far from where I was 2 years ago. 2 years ago I had extreme anxiety and couldn’t even be left alone for long periods of time since I would have panic attacks. Today I am working, working out, spending all day by myself, driving, and for the most part functioning as a normal person. Therapy helps! 

In June of 2023, I started my job at a doctors office. My coworkers are very sweet, and the job is good, has good working hours, not physically taxing, etc. Beyond getting less than 25 hours a week, in my heart, I know I don’t want to spend forever in healthcare. I didn’t go to school for healthcare; my job is a retail shop associate inside this office. Basically if the doctor recommends something, patients can stop in and pick it up without even leaving the building. 

Now, for the last several years, my dream job had been to work in an up and coming boutique. You know the ones you see online, and they go to market and are on top of all the latest trends. It’s so neat to see a business literally being built from the ground up in something that interests me. In September, I found one of these right here in my town! I was ecstatic. I applied and got the interview. I was offered the full time position, so I promptly put in my 2 weeks and left the doctors office on good terms. 

This is where things start to fall apart. 

My first week there was a shock to the system. My body was so sore from standing all day. My ears rang. The hours were different. Days were long. There was an employee there that was very, let’s say, colorful. She wouldn’t shut up, got personal, and made me feel very wary about proceeding forward. This employee has since quit. On top of that, of course I had my period that first week, so ladies you know I was achy and hormonal. 

I straight up panicked. I panicked about leaving my cushy job in the office, I panicked about this change. I panicked all night the whole week and couldn’t sleep. 

So after 1 week, I went back to the office and asked for my old job back. I was received well, my coworkers were happy that I was coming back. I made arrangements at the boutique and told them I would be leaving.

Fast forward to today and tomorrow is the last day of work at the boutique. I wish it wasn’t. My manager at the boutique and the owner both said that if I ever wanted a job there in the future to please come back they will definitely take me. After finding out that I was putting in my notice they sat me down and wanted to know if there’s anything they could do to retain me as an employee. They suggested switching me to a different department and working nights and weekends. unfortunately, I also turned that down a little bit due to anxiety, but I had said that I think it was going to be too much to juggle two jobs at once.

I am extremely embarrassed about letting my emotions dictate my actions. I don’t even want to go back to the doctor’s office. I don’t miss the healthcare. After a couple of days off to think I almost want to go to the boutique tomorrow and ask if there’s any way that I could work part time around the other job so as not to lose this opportunity. I’m not sure if I should just cut ties with the boutique now since I’ve been so wishywashy. I’m really very disappointed in my myself and how I handled this. I’m mentally and emotionally exhausted from this last month. 

TLDR; I left job A for dream job B. I didn’t give job B a chance. I asked for job A back. And now I wish I hadn’t and was just staying at job B. I’m embarrassed. ",2,1.0,5,PassengerNo117,2024-10-24 16:48:19,1gbecah,7,High

I work with, let’s call him Lenny (50+ male), he is the sales manager for a few product lines that I work on. Lenny thinks he’s a hot shot but the man is not as smart as he thinks and his attention to detail is scary bad. At first Lenny used to go on and on about how good I was at my job, but as I started to get more into the export side he has soured on me. He does not like that I ask him to clarify when he’s being confusing, doesn’t like that I point out when he’s made a pricing error (note I do not put him on blast I take care of it politely), he does not like when I correct him on things that he 100% should know and has done correctly in the past. 

Our working relationship has gotten quite contentious due to his constant disrespect towards me. I always approach him the same exact way as I approach the other sales people I work with and who I also get along with quite well. On several occasions he has been extremely rude, disrespectful, and just flat mean to my face with others present, namely my manager. My manager has spoken to Lenny about this several times and each time Lenny is better for a short period of time. Today he once again acted badly towards me in a meeting with my manager and another coworker. The point of the meeting was to correct a process with a specific order that was not in compliance. I sent him a list of my questions beforehand as talking points. He spent the whole meeting strongly implying that I cause complications and take too long to do things. My manager and I spoke after and he too is quite upset about Lenny’s behavior. The coworker who was present sent me a teams message after saying that was very hostile and asking if Lenny is always that way. 

This is where I need advice, clearly my manager talking to Lenny is not enough to make this hostile behavior stop. My manager has also spoken to one of Lenny’s managers about this. Part of me wants to report to HR, but i know that HR is there to protect the company and I don’t want a target on my back. But I also can’t stand his behavior and hostility anymore, I can’t work this way, I need to be able to ask questions and get clear answers to be able to set up these orders correctly and compliantly. I don’t know what to do, this is driving me nuts and it is also personally upsetting because I am good at my job, I have won multiple awards for being good at my job and I am tired of him bad mouthing me behind my back and to my face and just making it miserable to work together.

needadvice,friends (17F) feel uncomfortable due to another friend(17M,"I have recently gotten in a bit of a jam, for reference I 17M entered a new grade this year in school and met a group of girls (17F), don't know how but i managed to form some genuine friendships with 3 of them, to such an extent that the 4 of us have formed a different group all together.

2 years ago while i was in a younger grade, I made friends with the class loner 15M, he was awkward and most of the time alone, I helped him cheat in tests and we became okay friends, every year all students shuffle classes, this year he lost many of his friends who changed schools, and he started visiting me in my class room during lunch break.

I am usually having the lunch with the 3 girl, but he started coming more often every day, and now comes any second he can, In the morning before school starts, in the lunch break, and during dispersal.

It was all fine until 2 of my 17F friends have informed me how they become uncomfortable near him, and how he has been creepy towards them and don't like his attempts to join our group of 4, He has been awkwardly messaging them, and liking all of their stories and posts, sending them reels they have found to be inappropriate.

our class went on a recent trip, and he continuously followed me and kept photo bombing our group, I think he is just trying to be friendly, but has formed a bad image

How do i tell him to maintain his distance? to not visit anymore, he has been a decent friend until now, but i have formed stronger bonds with the girls, and can see what he is doing is improper on top of that he has a face of pity and acts as if I am his only friend, even tho he has others, what do i tell him?

While we technically do have space to host at our home, I'm leaning away from that for several reasons (we have a kitten, and a preschooler, and I'm a spectrumy introvert who doesn't use alcohol to cope with overwhelm anymore, to name a few).  Right now I'm thinking of some kind of game, or contest, for the group or teams where they could do or create something in order to win a prize.  They would have some kind of objective instead of just skulking around. 

  
Limitations would be the weather - it will be cold that time of year, so harder to hold something outdoors at a pavilion or park - and cost with renting a space.  He'd suggested roller skating because he loves to skate but not many kids are into that these days, which might end up being a flop.

needadvice,Getting out of a toxic friendship,"Here we go. A couple years ago i started graduate school and there was literally one other person that i liked in the program. We became really close and she integrated into all of my friend groups and we literally spend 24-7 together. She frequently and sporadically travels to a different state for her relationship (a whole different can of worms but not for this sub) , and we began to fight about it often (we’d get drunk and I’d tell her she wasn’t being smart… she’d say probably the meanest things I’ve ever heard back to me….) an on going cycle every time. She has known anger and mental issues but stopped going to therapy. Anyways. So flash forward the problem stems that when she goes away we lose all contact and she won’t respond to me at all (she’s really bad on her phone but I’m talking months on end). I am pretty anxiously attached and she’s avoidant, so that’s also part of it. But i have worked through a lot of that and kind of realized that she’s not a great friend. She’s inconsiderate, disrespectful, and unreliable, three traits i value tremendously in friends. The problem is that i love her and i absolutely love when our friendship is good. I’ve truly never felt so comfortable in a friendship before and she’s really improved me as a person. Some examples are i read books now, enjoy my job, go to therapy, learned to play a new sport, etc. I know to continue this without feeling like I’m a) walking on eggshells and she’ll blow if i say the wrong thing and b) not feel so incredibly anxious and disrespected, we need to change our friendship. I need to take a healthy step back and focus on myself more. Also I’ve tried to talk to her about her lack of communication, but it never works. I’m still really finding it difficult, so I’m seeking advice on how to make our toxic friendship healthy again. I often think that she’s literally the only friend I’ve made post grad (not my only friend, per se, but I’ve met all the others before i graduated college). I don’t want to lose her, but I’m afraid we’re not compatible as friends. Is there a way to improve our friendship? ",9,1.0,7,Autofriend713,2024-10-21 23:23:25,1g99st3,16,High

needadvice,How Should I Navigate Pursuing My Dreams While Honoring My Parents’ Wishes?,"Hey everyone,

I’m a 21-year-old guy from Sweden with African roots, and I come from a pretty strict family. My whole life, I’ve been following whatever my parents told me to do—whether it was where I train, work, meet friends, who my friends are, or even what I study. I’ve always wanted to be a psychologist, and here in Sweden, we have a system where you can still raise your grades even if you don’t get into your first-choice schools. That was my plan. I had many choices for psychology programs, but my parents didn’t allow me to pick ones where I could easily get in because they were further away. They wanted me to stay as close to home as possible, which basically meant not leaving the house.

So, I ended up having to choose my backup plan, which was an engineering program—specifically, industrial engineering and management. It’s a good program, but it was my backup if the psychology plan didn’t work out after a few years. My parents were afraid I’d end up never going to university and just getting a full-time job at a factory. They wanted to be proud of me and flaunt my achievements, so they pushed me into engineering.

Now, I’m in my third year of a five-year program, and by 2027, I should have my master’s degree. Even though math and physics weren’t my strong suits, I’ve done really well. I’ve passed the first two years, which are considered the hardest, and proven that I can handle my studies seriously.

I just wanted to add that since I’m the eldest, I do all the chores. I do everything in the house. My parents even joke to visitors that they don’t know how the house would work without me. My siblings do nothing, and I’m the only one doing the chores, and I do them automatically without even being told because that’s how I’ve been brought up. My brother is about to graduate from high school, and my parents have even come to me to convince him to stay at home because they don’t believe he can live on his own in a student apartment two hours away.

Even with all these responsibilities, I’ve shown my parents that I can work, train, and study all at the same time and manage it flawlessly, even with subjects that are not my strong suit, like math and physics. Despite doing all that, the whole study abroad program is being financed completely by me. I’ve paid for my health insurance, made all the applications, including the visa and flight tickets, by myself. I haven’t needed help with anything. The only time I’ve asked my parents for anything is just for advice to show them that I still value their opinion and that I’m not making every choice by myself.

They don’t value the trip, saying that finding yourself is just fake stuff said to young people on the internet and that I can find happiness at home and that I’m simply not trying and choosing to be depressed.

But here’s the thing: I’ve been in the same city my whole life. My elementary school, high school, and university are all within a two-minute drive of each other. I’m sick of this city, and I don’t find meaning in a lot of things anymore. I train just to train, go to school just to get the work done, and I haven’t been able to have a life of my own. It’s been so monotone, and I’ve had a hard time being happy at home. My parents see this as me not valuing family.

Then I got an offer for a study abroad program, which is only given to people with good grades and attendance. I applied a long time ago and didn’t think I’d get in, but I did. I was so happy because it felt like a chance to finally leave this strict household, prove my independence, and find myself. I’ve seen my friends leave the city, get student apartments, and grow, while I feel stuck in high school.

But my parents said no. They said it’s disobeying them and that leaving would curse me. So, I need advice: Should I go for this opportunity and risk upsetting my parents, or do I follow their wishes and potentially sacrifice my happiness for theirs?

We said we would mow it but that it isn't ours. It isn't on her property either just keep that in mind. 

She has asked us to ""move our stuff over a little more"" because she likes to walk along the side of her house (right up our driveway) to idk, be nosey. And she just wants space. Mind you, our stuff is on only our property. But we move it. 

I gave her some fresh butt nuggets from my chickens the other day and thought it was weird that she didn't answer the door, even though I saw her in her kitchen, seeing me.

needadvice,Need help with my mom's weird behavior,"So my mom are on opposite sides politically and religiously. I have no problem simply not discussing these things, but she can't see to do this. Every so often she'll throw some BS video or article at me ridiculing what she knows I believe in.

When this happens, if I argue about it she'll argue with me. If I ignore it she says nothing and then goes on as if nothing happened. It's very hurtful to me that she can't respect me.  

This happened recently in one of our two family chats. I went on a relatively big rant about how I don't appreciate this and don't want to discuss politics with her ever, at all. If she continues to post that stuff I'll leave the chat. 

A day later she posted several political videos in that chat. I left. I was so hurt that my mom would disrespect me to my face that way. 

(I'm still in a different family chat on a different platform though.)

Today she private messaged me a pancake recipe (that I thought looked great). And so the cycle continues. But I can't take this anymore. Throughout my adulthood it's been this way -- nice for a while, then extremely mean out of nowhere, then going on like nothing happened.

Now my mental health struggles is something that I've told him three times over the course of the years. But he never, ever ever asked me about it, matter of fact, he never even ever asked how I'm doing. This just makes me feel so worthless.

About a month ago I confronted him about it, and I said that I feel really sad that he doesn't ask me anything, and I said about what our mutual friend had told me. He just said that he asks a lot because he is usually very interested in her topics.

Well, I am always there for him, when he needed some help with studies, I spent over 20 hours on a Discord call with him, teaching him about Physics. When he almost failing a class I took my sweet time to help him. I never even ever got a simple ""thank you"".

Two days ago I told him that I am feeling extremely lonely, and that I have always felt this way in my life. But I'm feeling extremely lonely lately and it's being hard to cope with it and I'm very depressed.

Matter of fact, since I left college all our conversations have been online, never once in real life. But he texts me almost daily. And I text him too.

After I told him about my loneliness, he just said that life is made out of phases, and it'd pass soon. Honestly, I'd just expect him to ask me to hang out or anything. He always tells me how he's hanging out with his friends and having fun, but he never invites me.

Well, once he invited me his birthday in a Pizzeria, and he'd want to have me there, along with his other friends. I was very happy.

needadvice,"Friend facing homelessness, how much longer do I let her stay with us?","My husband and I own the house we live in.

My friend, Vee, has been living with us for the past 3 1/2 months while she waits to move into an apartment with her other friend, Ann.

Ann broke her hip, got surgery, and is no longer able to work. therefore Vee and Ann cannot move in together.

Vee does have a job and has been helping with bills. Now that she can’t move in with Ann, she has no place to go and is facing homelessness. Rent is too high for her to live on her own.

I feel like my husband and I wanting our privacy back is no reason to kick a friend out on the street, and it’s something I won’t do. 
But…Vee can’t stay with us forever. What do we do? Although Vee hasn’t given us any issue as a roommate and we are friends, I still  feel like I can never truly relax in my own home because we always have a guest. 

Any advice?

Editing to answer some questions and address some things:

1. Vee is not a senior
2. She is working a part time job with irregular hours and has been searching for a second job
3. I’ve told her all my concerns but we haven’t settled on anything yet. The housing authority has lots of places around town, but the waitlist is over a year long. The homeless shelters are small and full.
4. Most rooms that are being sublet only want college students, which Vee is not. Those leases are also short and not a viable long term solution (lots of leases end in May, for example)
5. Vee is not a bad roommate. This was just not a part of our original agreement and my husband and I would like our space back.
6. We are still searching for rooms she can sublet that aren’t for college students

We are doing a major renovation to our upstairs bathroom, its a very large project even though its just a ""bathroom"", its new shower, new bathtube, connected openly to master bedroom, also washer/dryer hookups.

Now its very mild, just comes and goes.  It doesn't really bother me, but its making my wife insane.  So far we've had drain person out, talked to the plumber, etc...  Most of the people say they can't even smell it at all.  I can smell it very mildly.

Any idea of what we should do for a smell that is troublesome but kind of hard to pinpoint?  Also, my wife is getting discouraged because all the professionals are saying nothing to do, and she says she almost can't be in the basement.

We tried candles and things, but she says it just kind of masks it but still smells bad.

needadvice,How to cope with not having a nuclear family?,"

Hello, so I'll try to keep it as short as possible.


I (23F) grew up with family A (this will make sense soon), always feeling left out, weird, and in general very lonely. My parents divorced when I was 7 and I stayed with mom A (63F). She was abusive physically and verbally and never got me into extracurricular activities, so I had few friends as well. Plus, she's estranged from her family because of her erratic behavior so no cousins to play with either. My brother (32M) is 9 years older than me and he was always very aloof and even ashamed of me. This made me gradually distance myself from them, I left home when I was 18 though I lived in the same city and I think the three of us would agree we're practically estranged. Dad A (68M) is not much better, he was never in the picture but at least he was never mean or abusive, we text once in a while.
Fast forward to when I was 21, family A sits me down and tells me I'm adopted. I was shocked but not sad, I thought it was my second chance. Turns out my biological mom (mom B [42F]) is dad's A niece, and she gave me up because my grandparents forced her to since she was in college and only 19. I have no resentment towards this decision, she had a very difficult situation in her hands. Since we did share some family I spent some time trying to get closer to mom's B siblings and their children (my cousins) I'm the older of all of them but still I've enjoyed their company and getting to know them. The only problem was that while all this was going on I already had a move planned across the country so I only see them once or twice a year.


After a year I decide to text mom B, all my aunts and uncles warned me that she is ""weird"" and sometimes a bit too blunt or harsh. I took this and went forward anyway. Slowly we started texting and after a year of that I finally visited her in Houston where she lives with her boyfriend and my younger brother (19M). That first trip was alright, I enjoyed it and we all tried to hang out and try to learn about each other. My brother is quite serious and not very outwardly affectionate, the opposite of me, but we have many interests in common and I enjoy talking to him. My mom B is also a bit cold but she's more of a goofball, I consider her to be very strong and resilient, as well as extremely smart. We also all look really alike and are STEM oriented which is new since I grew up looking and being very different to my nuclear family.
Fast forward to now, I've visited family B a second time and things have not going so well. Of course they are closer since they've lived their whole life together, but I'm starting to feel left out or even not wanted here. They start arguments where it's them against me, about any topic, and when it's start getting heated up and I try to pull out, mom B starts saying I'm being sensitive or dramatic. To clarify I'm also a fan of debate and I usually can handle it, but for some reason this instances really hurt my feelings.


For a few days now I can hear her coming into my brothers room and asking if he's hungry, and then going together to the kitchen to cook dinner or breakfast without even knocking on my door to see if I'm hungry as well.


I'm very grateful to see them, for them to let me stay at their home, and mom B even sends me some money once in a while since I'm in college and struggling.


Still, I can't shake the feeling that I'm the third wheel in all the families I've got, and I'm struggling to cope with the fact that I might never have parents or siblings I'm close to... I feel lonely and everywhere I look people got someone to rely on, I guess I have my aunts and uncles but they are strangers to me as well in some way. It's specially painful since I thought this was my second chance on a nuclear family, but I guess thats on my for creating expectations.

I also didn’t want to compare the deaths as they are drastically different. I said my condolences and  let her talk. As we became friends, she kept mentioning how she misses her dad and how it affects her- I wanted to add something to get rid of that awkward silence. We were in class and I was comfortable with telling her at this point, so I began to talk about my situation. 
All of a sudden the class we were in got quiet, so I stopped mid sentence and told her I’ll text her. She got the gist of what I was trying to say before and said it OUT LOUD whilst covering her mouth with a smile??? Maybe she was in disbelief.

needadvice,How to rebuild life after losing everything,"I (26F) am one of those that did everything right. Worked hard, knew my goals from a young age, kept hobbies. Travelled around to learn new cultures while graduating as the top of my department in my Bachelor’s, while working for an arts and non profit business. I dedicated a lot of energy and became a director in 6 years. Got married relatively young (22) to my partner of 7 years, to be able to move him abroad with me, to later get divorced due to it being unhealthy.

I moved 4 countries starting from an underprivileged one. The last one is where I currently am, came here to do my masters and PhD as I want to be in academia, I love asking questions and doing research. I deferred my masters and spent a year making sure the company I worked for would be financially stable before making the move. Started strong in my degree, balancing work and masters perfectly.

After an unfortunate situation I got a concussion (and a divorce after), which led to me being unable to look at screens or even think well for 9 months.  I made sure I went to the gym and physio during this, went to therapy to navigate the struggles. Built friendships that were beautiful and kind, still did my coursework for my masters on time - albeit not the best quality. But all of this left me burnt out. Because I was gone for 9 months from my job unexpectedly, the company faced some financial issues and rapidly came to a closing point due to the economic ambiguities of the world. My thesis work was behind, and I could not prepare for PhD applications on time. I also lost a chunk of my savings to be kind to someone. I don’t regret this kindness, but it put me in a difficult situation.

After a year of trying to ‘catch up’ on everything, I think I lost it a bit when I realized I can’t go back to the country I worked in before anymore, a place I’ve seen as my home. I was facing severe identity loss issues and burnout, which led me to losing an important person in my life. I think I severely lacked stability and instead of taking responsibility for my situation and being strong, I grew scared of anyone and anything that felt ambiguous.

Now, I feel truly lost. All my friends graduated already as I am graduating a semester late. I don’t have support systems here. I don’t have a stable job, I don’t know where I’ll live after graduation as I am in a student housing and was moving in with the person I lost. My parents are old and can’t support me much. My friends abroad are nice, but I don’t have visa flexibilities to go live with them. I don’t know if i’ll get into a phd this year either. I am still working and doing my thesis, but I also am grieving my losses. I have added a relationship counsellor to my therapy sessions to improve my healing journey. I volunteer, go to concerts with new friends when I can, workout, make music. But I feel like I lost it all and am so tired of restarting after having moved so many times and navigated differences of a new place.

Any words of encouragement would be great. I don’t want to turn out jaded and sad in this world. I want to believe in things working out, but it is getting hard. 

Edit: As someone mentioned finances and parents I wanted to clarify. I have worked and saved up for my moves and travels abroad my whole life. I first moved after being chosen for a scholarship. Later I found an internship and moved to the country of the company that recently closed. I have saved up for my own education while taking care of other adults my whole life, and currently am unable to afford housing.

needadvice,How to convince my mom to let me free the way I want to.,"Hi there I’m 15M 16 on February, and ever since little I’ve always liked the Chicano style and always embraced it since it was my culture and represents my personality and where I grew up. But my mom never let me use clothes like, she buys my clothes and dresses me a way I don’t feel comfortable or a way I don’t feel it’s me, she usually buys me skinny jeans that are to skinny and shirts that have a lot of lettering basically your average suburban kid clothes.

She doesn’t let me use pants that are baggy and if she doesn’t she still complains about it, she doesn’t let me use Nike dunks or Jordan’s or AF1 because “Cholos” use them, I can’t wear long sleeve shirts with nothing on top of it because I look bad, She doesn’t let me use sweaters with skulls, crosses, bandanas or letters with fonts of graffiti, I can’t use hats and if she doesn’t let me I can’t use them sideways or backwards.

I tried dressing Chicano and bought my own clothes with my own money I got by working and she threw them out and told me if she ever caught me using clothes like that again she’ll burn them. 

Every time I approach her about it she either yells at me, hits me, pulls my hair or something in that range, now I understand that she may think that I’ll look bad and she cares about my image but I sometimes feel like she thinks I’ll look like an embarrassment to her or something even when she says she’s catholic and doesn’t care about anybody’s image or their way to dress when she does and talks bad about people who dress a different way from her usual style she likes.

I also suffer from depression and trauma and she’s aware of it but doesn’t seem to care and put it aside knowing bringing up bad topics that trigger me and sometimes she does it on purpose and she always picks fights or yells at me in public if my pants are baggy or something and I get mad because it’s my style, my body my choices I want to make but she doesn’t listen.

But I want to talk to her at least one more time to try and convince her that I’m not her little baby anymore and that I’m growing up and she’s gotta start letting me go, so any tips on what I should do or say?  ",0,0.29,38,Ancient-School9453,2024-10-09 02:36:08,1fzlzha,38,High
needadvice,Is there any way to improve this situation or should I just move?,"I’m pretty introverted. I might laugh and joke with other parents but it’s often exhausting for me to show up to events etc… my daughter is a social butterfly. She’s very sweet and smart and thoughtful and sensitive. She cares so much for other people that it’s hard to see her ever get hurt. 


She made friends with 2 girls in kindergarten during covid and they quickly became best friends. Play dates at the park, always in groups, signed up for all the same things, and continued having classes together until 3rd grade. Third grade was tough because my daughter and one of the girls had class still but the third girl got split up. Her mother also changed her work schedule and was working full time and now she rode the bus and did after school care. I probably talked to her mom daily in person on the weekdays for 30min-hour at pick up and we texted often. 


I’m not sure what happened at the beginning of third grade but this girl was upset about not being a trio in school and took it out on my daughter. She would say mean things to her at recess and send girls over to my daughter to question her or pick fights and i always told my daughter to just stay out of fights and ignore it and that she seems like she is having a really tough time. This went on for months and my daughter started coming home crying daily for months and we would just talk things out and give her the tools to help her navigate it herself. She started getting pulled from class to talk with the girl and a special teacher to smooth things out between them because it was getting very problematic. I ended up speaking to a few teachers and the principal and they assured me that my daughter is doing just fine and is well behaved and they are working with the girl on some friends issues. Long story short - they ended up having an anti bullying rally over this because it continued with my daughter, an apparently it was happening to a few other girls a as well. When that didn’t work someone suggested reaching out to the parents since we had known them so well.


Another 2-3 weeks of bullying went on with my daughter coming home in tears that my husband texted the girls father. They had gotten very close as well leading up to this but his response to the subject was that he wasn’t too involved in that business and his wife would handle it. And the wife ended up texting me to talk and i called her and just explained a few serious situations - one about allergies that her daughter has that if it was true needed to be handled - but it was not. Her daughter admitted to lying and not being nice and her mother said they had needed to apologize to other families before this. She wanted to call and apologize the following day to my daughter and i said that’s not necessary, i just want them to get along and be friendly again. We had all been so close that it was hard on all of us and I was hoping things would get cleared up. 


A few days later I had seen the mom and her children at a sports game for the girls and they would not look at me. The mother shuffled her children away from me and the kids covered their eyes as they passed me! I couldn’t believe it. The dad ignored my husband, the mom ignored me, they wouldnt acknowledge us, wouldnt say hi etc… but I guess thats how it goes. I dont know what happened. 


This has continued for one entire year now. The girls are actually slightly getting along, they play the same instrument, same sports, same class now… we are at all the same events in and out of school because its such a small town. Not looking at me and not talking to me is fine but she has gone out of her way to invite all of the girls from the team over for playdates and pool parties and only exclude my daughter. I’m talking daily basis playdates with other girls and they go to school to rub it in my daughter’s face. They will bring girls to practice or take them home from practice and make plans in front of my daughter - the girls mother will stand with the whole group of kids on the team and pick kids to go to their house and just leave my daughter out. I know its hurting her she is getting so shy and withdrawn and anxious. 


I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t go to 3-5 events a week and sit by myself because she has gathered all the moms to gab in the corner and ignore me. The other moms give me dirty looks now too. She has even started inviting my younger daughters best friend over there and now there is a strain there too. What am I supposed to do? All this because we were tired of seeing my daughter get bullied Day after day. I have heard from 2-3 other parents that she did the same thing to their daughters and they dropped out of extracurriculars to avoid it (not confronting it at all). But it really seems like she is going out of her way to make my daughters life suck and i’m tired of it. And it’s fucked exhausting to me. Its exhausting to avoid someone all around town and events and school field trips especially when she will grab any parents around and gab their ear off and i’m stuck just putting my head down and playing on my phone, being upset and depressed every single day.


I feel like if I finally try to confront her she will play the “what do you mean? What are you talking about?” Gaslighting card and I’ll be worse off than before. Does anyone have any tips on how to work with mean girls when your life is intermingled with theirs?",1,1.0,1,nervous-nellie,2024-10-07 23:58:24,1fys3ku,2,Medium

rent is unecessary payment

need to take care of water, gas, internet, food, electricity

from calcs I made I would be left with enough money for urgencies / extra stuff

TrueUnpopularOpinion,"The left have actively been treating men like garbage for the last 8+ years, and no amount of gaslighting will change that.","Just about every time a new ""resistance"" style movement comes out, it seems like men are at the forefront of taking the abuse. Not only does social media allow it, but the media practically ignores it. We are blamed for nearly every bad thing that happens, and that becomes even worse if the man happens to also be white, and lord forbid ""str8"". This isn't even including if these people are those of faith or not. By nature, we are made out to be monsters, when all we want to do is live our life.

We have our own struggles that are exclusive to us, just as women do. Only difference is when our struggles are brought up in conversation, they get shut down and downplayed almost immediately. I'm all for supporting women and seeing they get all the support they need, but when it comes to getting the support and care I need as a man, we're met with ridicule. Misandry is publicly acceptable on just about every platform, because if many of these types of comments were made about women, they'd be shut down quickly.

No matter what shxt we are put through, we are told constantly that we are ""privileged"", yet when we bring up all the privilege women have, we are laughed out of the room essentially and are told that ""if you're privileged, equality feels like oppression"" or some BS. If we bring up the fact that men have zero legal right to genital integrity at birth here, we are mocked for it. We are told to support every cause for women, and even when we support their causes, our rights and causes are belittled and ignored. When women physically, sexually, verbally, and/or emotionally abuse us, it gets downplayed ""because men do it more"". That's what it always comes back to. They'll be the first ones to say that certain crime stats ""aren't valid due to overpolicing"", but when you suggest that men are overpoliced, they'll disagree and continue clutching to their pearls that we're always the problem.

While the subject has been beaten like a horse already, the majority of them refuse to admit that the Man vs Bear debate wasn't blatantly offensive. They're allowed to use anecdotal experience as reasoning for labeling an entire group of people as dangerous, but if we do the same to them, it's called ""misogyny"". If we do it to any group of people besides men, it's suddenly not okay. But men are the targets? A-OK. We have to be okay as being labeled dangerous monsters by default, and if we don't, then it's ""men telling on themselves"". It's like telling a certain darker group of people that ""if you don't break the law, then you have nothing to worry about"". That debate was nothing more than a misandrist attack on men as a whole, and it took the world by storm and got the majority of women to agree with it.

As for the women who value our rights and causes who don't mock or invalidate us, they're labeled as a ""pick-me"" by all the others, and are cast out. What's most insulting of all, is if you tell people this is what's been happening, they'll simply tell you that it's ""not true"" and that all of this behavior simply ""didn't happen"". Yet they are still completely baffled and shocked by the election results and chalk men not voting blue to nothing more than misogyny. The complete refusal of any accountability.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,Im excited for a Trump presidency,"What am I excited about?

1. With the trifecta they will at least be able to push policy. I was listening to a left podcast (podsaveamerica) where they basically said if Dems with the house then ""Trump will pass no legislation"". Like what? I mean we all know that's how it works but basically taking the mask off saying we're going to inhibit anything and everything he does indiscriminately. This goes both ways but honestly fuck this country. Whether that's because his policies would be legitimately worse for people or because they're secretly terrified that they will actually do good, who knows. But having a slim majority will allow *something* to get done but probably not anything too extreme.

2. We need some more anti-establishment. I'm actually psyched that we're bringing in more people outside of politics to fill positions too, I don't love Elon but department of efficiency sounds like a fucking fantastic idea so far. I hope he follows through on making government more transparent and less wasteful so the people crying and seething can slowly realize that this is ultimately the type of change that EVERYONE wants and can eat their hats watching Trump enact it.

3. Hopefully this will send a strong message to Dems so they can use this downtime to work on themselves and reflect on their behavior. This was largely a vote of no confidence for them, so if it catalyzes some serious change in how they interact with average people and the opposition I will be happy to see it.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,"I am a former volunteer in, die hard supporter of Ukraine, and Kamala voter. Trumps peace plan is actually pretty good.","To start, my fiancé is Ukrainian but I am American. I lived in Ukraine before the war and have been a volunteer in Ukraine during the war (first responder for rocket attack sites, not military). I can provide proof to mods if desired but I won’t post my face here. In this election I voted for Kamala ONLY because of Ukraine, Trump just refused to lay out his plan so there’s no way I could vote for it considering it’s my only issue.

When he said he’ll have it over “in 24 hours” I saw that as bow to Putin and give him everything he wants including full control over the rest of the occupied states and lifting sanctions. He could still do this and it would be terrible, however his plan he has released with European troops covering the CURRENT front lines, America providing weapons to Ukraine, and Europe rebuilding is actually pretty decent if he can get it.

Let me give my main reasons why:
1. Ukraine is running out of men, my fiancé’s brother has been hiding for over a year now to not be mobilized and I don’t blame him. There’s already a huge wall of men from her 2,000 population village that have all died in this war.
2. Many Ukrainians have abandoned the war and country. I only realized this when I volunteered in the country for an extended period of time and it’s not talked about online at all. The vast majority of the 6 million Ukrainians who have left the country are not going to return. I don’t blame them, in fact all my previous Ukrainian friends before the war left and don’t plan on coming back. This already is going to cause MAJOR economic problems for the country.
3. Europe has slept big time on this war. It is very frustrating to me not just as an American but as a caring person that Europe hasn’t stepped up their game on arms production to help their Eastern friends and now that my fellow Americans tire of funding it, it seems that’s it. Ukraine wasn’t even an issue this election sadly but it seems this election decided its fate.

I also want to add my fiancé also supports this and just wants peace and she has been a die hard supporter of her country for over 10 years.",269,0.8,218,TheBigQuestion354,2024-11-13 06:52:54,1gqc6oy,487,High

TrueUnpopularOpinion,"Dems Lost Because They Let ""Facts"" Get In The Way of Reality","Democrats relied on twisting facts and statistics rather than people's lived reality and that's why they lost so badly. People don't care about facts when they contradict their own lived reality.

First is inflation- Democrats bragged that they fixed inflation and point to declining inflation numbers as proof. While that may be technically true- the rate of inflation is lower now than it was 2 years ago- it still means that things are much more expensive than they were before- 20-25% more vs when Trump was president. People's LIVED REALITY isn't that ""prices at the grocery store are increasing slower than before"" which is what the inflation rate measures, is ""prices are much higher than 4 years ago"" which is the cumulative rate of inflation.

Second are jobs- Democrats keep touting how well they are doing creating jobs and how strong the economy is, and they point to low unemployment numbers and ""job creation"" statistics to back themselves up. But if you have been looking for a job lately you will know that doesn't match up with people's lived reality. The job market is brutal right now and just because a person is employed doesn't mean they are happy in their current job. If you peel back the numbers, you'll also find that the majority of job growth in the US during the Biden admin have gone to government jobs rather than the private sector. Furthermore, anecdotally it seems that many jobs are indeed going to undocumented immigrants - check out the breakfast club segment here: [https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9QQ-93J4Gd/?igsh=MWt1bDZnMWJqZGk0cg==](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9QQ-93J4Gd/?igsh=MWt1bDZnMWJqZGk0cg==)

So when Donald Trump said ""They're taking black jobs!"" at the debate which Democrats loved to call r@cist, he actually spoke to the LIVED REALITY of many black and Hispanic voters who find themselves competing for jobs with migrants. Democrats can point to all the statistics they want about how immigration actually leads to job creation in the long run, but it doesn't address the LIVED REALITY of people who find themselves competing with immigrants today.

These two issues- inflation and jobs, were enough to sink any democrat's chances of getting elected, but I can go on and on about how democrats let facts and figures get in the way of people's lived reality. Until they learn that reality doesn't care about their facts, they will continue losing elections.",96,0.67,174,Erik-Zandros,2024-11-13 08:21:31,1gqdyde,270,High

It's been explained on all these other issues/burdens that they want to place on companies, that none of these increase prices to consumers because the company is simply charging as much for a product as they can in the first place. If the cost to the company goes up, that doesn't necessarily mean that they can just charge more for it and succeed with that strat in the open/free market.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,The new DOGE (Dept. of Gov. Efficiency) to be run by Musk & Ramaswamy is great to remove waste from the govt,"So, with a new Trump presidency, he will be introducing the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). 

Although there’s already an efficiency department in the govt, that’ll likely be absorbed or dismantled and replaced by this one.

So, this is so important it’s unbelievable. It’s fair to say many longtime federal govt workers do the extreme bare minimum. 

Lazy government workers need to get removed from
Their positions and put back in the lower rungs of the unemployment system/work force where they can learn what hard work actually is.

I’ll highlight a scenario Im aware of that many others have probably heard similar stories of:

One of my buddies (39) got a PhD in Marine Botany or some shit. Anyways, he studied underwater plants in some tiny fishing village somewhere and gave it up after 6 months.

He moved to the capital and got a job in the Health dept for the Feds. Now, this guy is a go-getter. He was too of his class, etc. 

First week there? Gets told to “slow down” not “work that hard,” as is the ethos of the department.

So, instead of knocking off 3 projects a week through efficient working where capability is there — they get 1 projects done. All so the highly paid, good pension, well taken care of federal workers can do the least amount of work for one of the cushiest gigs in town. And it needs to end.

Another of my buddies switched from private finance to a govt department and it was the same ethos there.

Why are we giving $80,000 a year to 3-4 people who have horrendous work ethics, when we can replace them with 1 of my buddies under a proper ethos who is willing to work 100% of their effectiveness and we save the $$?

Then those lazy workers can go work in a field picking fruit or placing sod down someone’s lawn for minimum wage and maximum work.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,Kamala Harris lost the election because of the inflation.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, [supply chains collapsed](https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/supply-chain/how-covid-19-impacted-supply-chains-and-what-comes-next) and a reorganization of the labor market caused massive staffing issues for employers. This made production much harder and slower, leading to a type of inflation that's tough for governments to counter known as cost-push inflation.

Oil companies [cut production to the bone](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/which-us-refineries-have-shut-since-global-pandemic-why-2022-06-17/) during lockdowns because nobody was driving. They were very slow to reinvest in production when the lockdowns ended because their industry is slowly becoming obsolete and oil plants are really long-term investments. So it was a lot more profitable to just keep capacity low and bilk us for all they could.

This, coupled with supply chain disruptions from the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused [hyperinflation worldwide](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/06/15/in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world-inflation-is-high-and-getting-higher/) in 2021, which has in turn led to a [global wave of incumbents losing elections](https://theconversation.com/inflation-is-radioactive-trumps-victory-is-part-of-a-global-populist-wave-of-voters-throwing-out-incumbents-243113). Voters sought to punish political parties for inflation that occurred under their watch.

In the ideal case, you'd think a government could find ways to reduce the inflation, raise wages, and save the economy for regular folks in that way, and you'd be right. But keep in mind -- even if inflation were to drop to 0% by election day, consumers don't forget the price of bread 4 years ago. And even if they're making more than enough to keep up with inflation, most people will credit themselves rather than the politicians. On top of that, wage increases may not happen *evenly*, and some workers might lag behind, such as if they're on a minimum wage or disability income that doesn't adjust with inflation.

None of this is to say that this was the only contributing factor, or that the Dems had no chance. Fundamentally, Trump won because he ran as a populist outsider who criticized the status quo and promised to mix things up. It didn't matter that the specifics of his plan were dogshit, most voters aren't policy analysts and are going off of vibes first and foremost. The most obvious thing to do to beat 'im would've been to simply run a populist outsider of their own, or at the very least, try to run Harris as a populist outsider.

People will tell you Harris lost bc she was too anti-Gaza, too pro-Gaza, too woke or not woke enough, too soft on immigration or too hard on immigration. Reality is, it was none of that; she lost in a blowout, and none of those issues come even close to accounting for the loss she suffered, not individually and not in combination. What we're seeing is the result of much broader economic trends that her campaign simply didn't adequately account for.",40,0.71,82,No_Discount_6028,2024-11-13 06:51:21,1gqc5r2,122,High
TrueUnpopularOpinion,Misandry on reddit is a serious issue ,"The presence of subreddits that post hateful and misandrist content toward men, *often under the pretense of being “feminist” or “women’s support” spaces*  go far beyond supporting women or advocating for equality; they have become echo chambers of hostility against men, openly promoting resentment and stereotypes that are harmful to both men and the broader goal of genuine gender equality.

The posts in these subreddits include content that stereotypes men as inherently harmful, emotionally deficient, or morally inferior. Posts frequently frame men as fundamentally flawed, creating a negative and biased view that fails to acknowledge individual diversity and perpetuates toxic stereotypes.

Many posts express extreme resentment and disdain for men, encouraging harmful rhetoric like “all men are dangerous” or “men are only good for…” These statements serve no purpose other than to incite anger. Some posts go as far as to advocate for isolating or mistreating men in personal or professional relationships, painting these actions as justified due to a perceived collective guilt attributed to all men.

Under the guise of offering advice, these subreddits often discourage empathy or fair treatment towards men. Content advising women to “assume the worst” about men or promoting distrust creates an unhealthy and divisive mentality. 

It’s pretty frustrating to see certain subreddits openly promoting hostility toward men under the label of “feminism” or “women’s support” when Reddit has banned countless male-centered subs for similar issues. Reddit’s taken a strong stance in the past against communities that push misogynistic or hateful content against women, banning those spaces quickly and enforcing a zero-tolerance policy on gender-based hate speech. But, when it comes to misandrist communities, there seems to be a double standard that allows these subs to continue operating without accountability.",258,0.81,145,PublicDisk4717,2024-11-12 19:07:40,1gq0wuc,403,High
TrueUnpopularOpinion,People dont see people on the internet as living breathing humans,"The title is a bit confusing but when I mean is, when people connect to the Internet or they're on social media, everything is fictional to their eyes. Seeing people in videos, hard to tell it's real people just acting for a video. Talking to people in comments or sometimes servers, and can't connect that's a real person behind those comments. Seeing art (not AI) done or stories written and forget a real living breathing person did that. 

It's hard to tell what's real or fake on social media because every comment you see brainwashes you to ""not believe everything on the internet"", and this comment is good for half of the time but it's a double edged sword. So many bots comments, so many ai art and AI videos are posted, just a lot of bot content farm as well that it's harder to tell what's real. 

I have caught myself talking to someone in the comments who don't understand what I'm saying and realize they're human. I think it's harder to remind yourself you're talking to a human because there's no face, no voice, nothing behind it that signals to your brain that it is someone real. I bring up this thought because I was thinking about why people have been so cruel and mean to each other on social media over time. Back when it began, while there was bullying, it was less aggressive and mean. But not it's everywhere, there's not a place you won't find someone telling them to off themselves for having a different opinion. Or belittle or insult each other. 

People have had a easier time being cruel and nasty to each other on the internet because they forget they are talking to a real human behind the screen, and it's hard to remember and remind yourself that it's a real person behind the screen. I don't really know if this is unpopular, but it feels like it. Sometimes when I look at comments people act more robotic than self thinking at times, and thats not a insult, it's just a think I've noticed thats kind of concerning. Has anyone else noticed how people don't recognize that it's another human on the other side of the screen they're talking to?

TrueUnpopularOpinion,Trump is by far the most funny president,"Not because he actually has a good sense of humor per se, but because he's so unintentionally funny and does dumb things while being/running for the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. His way of talk and speaking is so iconic to the point where you can type it out and people can instantly tell who you are trying to mock because he always repeats the same point multiple times. His tweets and social media posts are so dumb and over-exaggerated with the words in all-caps and exclamation marks. His voice is so iconic as well. Theres a reason why he became an instant staple in internet meme culture.

I honestly feel bad sometimes for laughing at some of the things he says and does since it harms or can potentially harm people, or just be really disrespectful (imo). But I would be lying if the video of him straight up throwing paper towels out to the crowd when Puerto Rico was hit by a hurricane didn't make me crack up. You have to remember this is the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES doing this shit, broadcasted live to the ENTIRE world. Its so unprofessional for such a big important role to the point where its funny.

He always says stuff before properly thinking about it, such calling Hurricane Florence that hit Florida in 2018 ""One of the wettest we’ve ever seen, from the standpoint of water"". Or when he literally used a SHARPIE to redraw the path of Hurricane Dorian when people were panicking trying to see if it would hit them or not. All broadcasted to hundreds of millions if not billions of people around the entire world. Its so incredibly dumb. 

The McDonalds and garbage truck stunts were also funny as hell. Its so dumb seeing this man literally load up fries and serve them to pre-selected customers just because Kamala ""never worked at McDonalds"", and of course [making this tweet right after the stunt saying the McDonald’s ice cream machines “will work great again” if he gets elected](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1850326584537858393?s=46). Or him riding around in a garbage truck with big ass Trump flags on it because Joe Biden called him and his supporters garbage after they literally said the exact same thing about Puerto Rico. Keep in mind this is a Presidental campaign. You just can't make this stuff up.

He also does know how to make a good witty joke sometimes too, such as when the lights turned off when he was making a speech at a rally and quickly said ""they didn't pay the electric bill"". And then when the lights turned back on and they were too bright, he completely stopped his speech and started waving his hands chanting and yelling “TURN OFF THE LIGHTS!"" and encouraging his crowd to chant with him. 

And like stated before, he has some of the most iconic and funny tweets ever, such as [“The fake news trophy”](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/935147410472480769), or [“I promise not to do this to Greenland!”](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1163603361423351808?s=46) when he was trying to buy Greenland. The AI stuff he did, such as the one with Kamala at a big communist rally with the hammer and sickle, is also so dumb. His meltdowns on twitter/truth social are also always so entertaining to watch as well, especially because you can tell and predict when hes gonna post something soon complaining or responding. Its so petty. Whenever I need a good laugh I just scroll through his old tweets. 

This entire era of Obama-Trump-Biden in US politics in general has been consistently funny. A lot of Trump's jokes about Biden, such as the senior home advertisement video, have made me laugh so incredibly hard. Biden is also so unintentionally funny, especially because of how old he is while being in a position this important, and of course his clumsiness. Obama is just funny in general and has a good sense of humor as well. I can honestly see why some people just see US politics as a big reality TV show and never take it that serious with all of this going on.

There have been a lot of funny presidents, but Trump is the only one that has consistently made me laugh all the way from when he started his first campaign in 2015 to now.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,"Kamala Harris Didn’t Lose Because of 'W0ke Culture,' G3nder, or R4ce!!","As a feminist and part of the queer community, I’m honestly **tired** of hearing that Kamala Harris lost the election just because **she’s a woman or because she’s Black**. That argument is not only lazy, but it completely misses the real reasons behind her struggles. Reducing her loss to her identity is **FREAKING ridiculous**!

One of her biggest missteps was relying on celebrities like **Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion** to engage voters. Especially because they sing about things like wanting their p\*ssies eaten—no shame, but for real, **why would you bring artists like that to your campaign?** While they have huge followings, they didn’t bring the seriousness or credibility that Kamala needed.

And let's be clear: her G3NDER and R4CE were not the reasons for her struggles. The truth is, **we're at a point where people are ready to elect a strong woman**, but it’s about the type of woman. If **Kamala had presented herself with more authority, confidence, and preparation, I believe she could’ve had a real shot.** The problem wasn’t her being a woman—**it was the way she led.** She came across as unprepared and unsure at times, and blaming her **g3nder** is just an easy excuse to avoid confronting the real issues with her candidacy.

**Another serious concern is how she would’ve been perceived by global leaders, especially authoritarian figures like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. These leaders respect power, strength, and authority. If they don’t take a U.S. president seriously, that puts the entire country at risk. For the U.S. to maintain its global influence, we need a president who commands respect and isn’t seen as easily intimidated. Kamala didn’t project that level of strength, which further hurt her candidacy.**

In the end, Kamala Harris didn’t lose because she’s a woman or because she’s Black. She lost because she failed to project the kind of leadership that’s needed to run this country. It’s not about identity—it’s about leadership. The truth is, she came across as weak, and that’s what ultimately held her back. ITS NOT ABOUT R4CE, G3NDER OR W0KE CULTURE, she was a weak candidate.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,Don't complain about your food your food on a public forum.,"Obviously that kind of post doesn't appear on my feed (here and elsewhere) every day, but every time it happens it mildly infuriates me. 

I get it, prices are rising and everybody needs to eat but you don't need to eat there, complaining on a public forum or social media about a random no name snack spot will do exactly nothing.  

If you want to vent and give feedback, perfectly fine do it, but target your effort.  If you are not satisfied with your French fries portion because it's too expensive for too little, say that to the owner or the manager; if they don't respond to your satisfaction, don't go there anymore.  And maybe leave a (somewhat) negative review somewhere, which is also a good solution if you are shy and don't want to confront people directly.  Just be aware that sometimes you have to choose between quality and quantity.

And, for the most part, I don't like when people complain about the price of luxury stuff, you don't need that type of stuff, just don't buy it.  And when you do need that kind of stuff, say food, you more often than not have a cheaper alternative, some of which are good and some aren't.  Sure, it sucks when something become enough unaffordable to you, but unless it's Martin Shekelk buying the pharma group that own the medicine you need and jacked up the price (in which case, fuck him), but that's modern-day capitalism to an extent, life goes on.",0,0.5,1,ThisI5N0tAThr0waway,2024-11-13 17:43:18,1gqr5xr,1,Medium
TrueUnpopularOpinion,Cutting people out of your lives because they support Trump wont help.,"I get it. You've had enough of people you think are crazy, so you just don't want to deal with them anymore. However, this will not lead to a positive outcome. Ostracizing family members isn't a punishment that will ""wake them up"" and have them crawling back to your side. It will only drive those family members further in to their echo chamber. In ancient times exiling people was akin  to a death sentence these days it's a slap on the wrist that actually fortifies your opposition. Lets turn it around. My MAGA family members cut me out of the picture and say I'm too liberal. What do I do? Do I get on my hands and knees and ask them to let me back in to the Thanksgiving table? Or do I forget them and hang out with people that wont throw me to the curbside and have more in common with my current beliefs? I would choose the second option and most people in this day and age would to. Now I've been thrust further towards the side that the people cutting me off wanted to distance themselves from. This is exactly what people are doing when they cut contact with friends and family who voted Trump. 

If you need a real life POSITIVE example I give you [Daryl Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Davis#:~:text=When%20Kelly%20left%20the%20Klan,hundred%20people%20leaving%20the%20Klan). A black man who with his mere presence changed lives of dozens of established KKK members. He would show to KKK events. Hang out with them. He'd even disagree with them, but that didn't matter because he acted like a friend towards them. His mere presence and ability to respectfully oppose (EVEN WHEN THEY WERE FLAMING RACISTS) contributed to de radicalizing dozens if not hundreds of Klan members.

""But why is it my problem that they're stupid. Why do I have to tolerate them when I know what they believe? It's not fair!""

No. No it's not fair. BUT it works. Distancing yourself and isolating your friends and family doesn't. It will only increase the likely hood that they'll get worse because they'll only be listening to one side. ",1,1.0,1,Background-Ad-9956,2024-11-13 17:00:13,1gqq7ig,2,Medium

TrueUnpopularOpinion,The Urban/Rural Divide will keep getting bigger.,"In the early 2000s it was thought the internet, suburbs and transportation would bridge this gap but I've seen it go the other way in numerous regions of North America. Sometimes it's akin to national borders but certainly most characteristics are noticeably different in people. What the internet did was make communication easier but then also made it much easier for people to learn about like-minded communities and move there. It's a type of gentrification really and why I use the political flair is because with politics becoming more like rooting for sports teams and social media creating echo chambers I think voting patterns becoming easier to see.

The future was typically painted as being more unified and that people were different due to travel distance/seclusion. But I think we've gone over this period and will now continue to drift further apart. Cities trying to establish parks and nature themed areas means even those thinking of leaving cities are persuaded not to.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,We Don't Understand Our Time In History,"What will history remember about our day 100 years from now?  We often think the President is the all-important feature of our time, as if it is somehow special, but this is misplaced.

A century ago, Calvin Coolidge was President.  The vast majority of people reading this can't tell me very much about him without googling it.  (Fun fact: his son was playing tennis on the White House lawn when he got a blister on his foot that got infected.  He eventually died from this injury.)

But people do generally remember this guy by the name of Henry Ford and how he revolutionized the assembly line.

Likewise, a century from now history will remember Obama as the first black president, Trump as the first (and second) orange president, and Biden as one of (but not the only) the zombie presidents.  What did any of these people do during their terms?  Nobody will know nor care.

But what will people generally remember about today?  I argue that history will look back on this era and remember the Shale Revolution that kicked off circa 2005 and continues to have an incredibly positive impact across the globe.  This occurs along three vectors, the importance of which are difficult to overstate.  

1) Shale has dramatically mitigated carbon emissions - far more than renewable energy could ever dream to, and at a fraction of the cost in subsidies.

2) Shale spurred enormous economic growth by driving down the price of energy.  Shale was by far the most important factor that helped the US emerge out of the 2008 recession, and it continues to play an important role as the US has gone from parity to the EU economy to almost double over the same timeframe.

3) Shale greatly mitigated the global impact of the nefarious regimes that make up OPEC, and Russia.  While these regimes are still important to pay attention to, the free world's ability to get along without them has only gotten stronger as a result of this new energy resource.

Now, there are plenty of those who have fought against fracking, but with history as my guide, we will probably forget about them, which is unfortunate.",4,0.83,9,snuffy_bodacious,2024-11-13 09:37:33,1gqfnbo,13,High
TrueUnpopularOpinion,Calling Trump Hitler has resulted in the opposite of the intended effect.,"For nearly a decade, people in the media and on social media have been comparing Trump to Hitler. The goal behind this comparison is to paint Trump as evil, like Hitler. However, this is an exaggerated and misleading characterization.

 Trump is not Hitler. 

Despite this, the repeated comparison has been effective, with some on both the left and right believing it. For certain people on the right—especially younger generations who grew up hearing this comparison—it doesn't make them see Trump as evil like Hitler. Instead, some people have started to view Hitler more favorably, associating him with Trump's qualities.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,Boxing is the hardest combat sport.,"1. I don't WANT to have to rely on the capabilites of other martial arts (Wrestling, Muay Thai, Bjj). I want to get the person out of there without the slightest reprocusions happening to me.

2. I don't want to ""Grapple"" with you!. I want a pistol! Matter of fact a revolver! Because, I will never miss. It will always work like Alcohol. AND, I just need one.

3. I don't want to be told (After being Concussed), That I have ten seconds to wake up. 

4. If you've ever tried Wrestling. Well, atleast you can still breath. There is nothing like getting caught with a devastating uppercut that can change your whole worldview. Especially by somebody you don't know. For example, if that person is Mike Tyson. And, He/She just happens to be in the same weightclass as you. It is devastating, and a bit addicting! Because you never WANT to get hit with that shot ever!! again.. Trust me. It hurts.

5. Muay Thai just has too many weapons. I don't want to bring a tool box to a job where I would only need a screwdriver. I know this. 

These are my reasons. Purely based off of my anecdotal and somewhat scientific experiences.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,We don't need a new game console generation,"I've actually been saying this for years and it's still true... basically, any game you could possibly want to make, CAN be made right now with the hardware we have.

We're now in the age where people justify it by getting ultra picky.  ""Oh this version runs in 4k at 120 fps!"" yeah but for a great many games this barely matters.  Even for games like racing or first person shooters it doesn't matter as much as people like to say.  I played Doom Eternal on both PC and Switch and it's still a kick-ass game either way.

But moreover, when you went from say the SNES to the PS1 and N64, that enabled *actual new types of games*.  Mario 64 couldn't be done on a SNES.  Xenogears would have to be a completely different game on the SNES.  So on and so forth.

But I look at a lot of modern games and I'm like, ""why couldn't this have been done on the PS2?""  A lot of times the answer is, ""it could have.""  (Speaking strictly in terms of hardware, of course).  Minecraft might be the sole outlier here and, well... that currently *does* exist on everything current.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,Lovecraft wasn't an evil racist,"Lovecraft undeniably held some racist beliefs. From his cat name to some of his writings, it can be concluded that the society around him shaped him in that position.

However, I've been reading a lot of his work lately, and I'm noticing a shift in his writing. While society certainly shaped him at that time, I think he started seeing things differently. This is only based on fiction and nothing else. So, I may not have yet uncovered it.

TLDR; his later work shows less explicit racism and greater respect for different cultures. He uses his cosmic horror as an equalizer to make it ""human"" vs ""impossible forces"" and focuses on fearing the unknown instead of the ""other"", which was more present in his earlier works. He condemns actual atrocities, and while his themes focus on ""the thinking man"", the actual outcome is often that being smart simply means not listening to others you perceive beneath you and then finding out the consequences.

\---

On the topic of his pet. At the time, Lovecraft was 14. What 14-year-old doesn't hold shitty beliefs given to him by his parents/society? This is wrong, but I don't think he knew better, and I would argue this was probably the standard back then. No excuse, but it wasn't the same 120 years ago as it is now.

On his writing, and there are spoilers for his 100+ year old stories:

I finished reading ""The Temple,"" which is about a Nazi submarine slowly descending into madness. At first, I wasn't sure if Lovecraft loved Nazis, as the text sure had a lot of praise for them. But there are a few lines in there that made me reconsider.

The captain of the UBoat berates his ""weaker"" equal in his diary, saying stuff like ""He should know that any action, against women and children, are justified in the name of the state"" or something like that.

This, to me, is evidence that Lovecraft was calling out the captain for his rigid and horrific justification of war atrocities. This text was filled with such nuggets.

In other works, while science and exploration is often praised, it often leads to the explorer dying or going insane or doing something horrible. Often, the ""savages"" or uneducated folk try to warn them, which often makes the person ""too smart"" to listen which makes them reap the consequences.

There is a story (I forget the title) where a scientist does horrible experiments on a human, only to uncover there is a demon lord trapped that he releases. His reward is learning he unlocked a vengeful being, which destroys a star or galaxy at the end of the book that the protagonist can see in the sky. Also, his indifference to the person he tortures to get to the outcome is pretty horrifying and uncomfortable in the reading.

I was surprised to see that in Mountains of Madness and The Mound, the civilizations portrayed are heartless, cruel and not really human, but there is respect for them. It isn't about the other. It is about the cosmic horror of the unknown and the full exploration of nihilism. As a matter of fact, there are parts where aboriginal tribesmen try to warn the protagonist and impart to him solid wisdom, which, of course, he does not listen to.

In The Curious Case of Charles Dexter (That one was a bit of a slog at times), the bad guys are white dudes raiding and pillaging tombs and exhibiting the worst and most evil reflection of humanity. In that story, he calls them out for being slaves and plantation owners and brings forth the fact that these are evil practices and, somehow, not the worst thing these men have done. In the end, the protagonist accidentally unleashes an ""enemy"" of these people, which causes a reckoning that is seen as a positive to end these horrors.

My theory is that, like most, Lovecraft was raised racist. However, through his own journey, he started to realize this as he met and worked with other writers. It could be that, through these connections, others, he was forced to re-evaluate and change his position.",1,1.0,0,Noisebug,2024-11-13 12:24:42,1gqjp59,1,Medium
TrueUnpopularOpinion,I don’t think any woman can manipulate her kids to hate their father without the father constantly being evil,"As a very traditional conservative guy, I constantly hear dads complaining that the reason why his kids hate him is because of their mother.

Despite my personal beliefs this almost never passes the sniff test. Kids naturally adore their father and mother. So for you to do something that made all your kids hate you usually takes a lot of work and reoccurrence. 

The most common excuse is lack of presence due to work.

If you had to constantly work, most kids will understand why when they’re teenagers and adults but If you used work as an excuse to simply not be there for years or decades then they will know. 

You can’t constantly drop in once every 7 years then claim your kids don’t want to have a relationship with you when you were working.

A lot of dead beat dads seem to think their kids are morons for some reason and it makes sense why their kids see them in a negative light.

The others simply have very little excuse, you used to beat your wife and kids when you got drunk but only on “occasion” or always did inappropriate things to them. Guess what? They don’t have to forgive you, it’s not their mother that brainwashed them. It’s you with your actions. ",0,0.31,4,Particular_Notice911,2024-11-13 20:21:53,1gquf6y,4,Medium

TrueUnpopularOpinion,China invading Taiwan is happening very VERY soon and it's insane people still refuse to see it,"I 100% believe China WILL invade Taiwan sometime during Trump's term, likely in the middle of his 4 years... marking 2027 as the most likely year. 

Given Taiwan-US ties, the US may not be obligated to but has traditionally been bound to defend Taiwan in the case of a China invasion. For those unaware (which I'm sure is like 99.99% of people...), China has ALREADY tried to invade Taiwan thrice in the past, and would've succeeded long ago if not each US president's intervention. At one point, heck, the US even threatened Mao Zedong with nukes if they invaded. 

So why do i think it is it going to happen very soon... of all times? Because the Trump administration is *the perfect storm* for China right now. Trump has built up his entire image and credibility on being anti-war and promising to ""end wars"". He entering a war with China over Taiwan would discredit him and make him lose support from his uneducated voter-base who don't know anything about the geopolitical importance of Taiwan. Trump himself seems like a complete goon on this when he recently remarked on how Taiwan should pay the US for its defense (similar to South Korea).

In fact, I think this is the strategy China is going to go for, in same style as Russia. They'll coordinate with NK to launch simultaneous invasions on Taiwan and South Korea respectively. This would not only catch US off-guard but also spread out the US' military resources far too thinly. I also believe at this point in time, Putin would've purposely prolonged the Ukraine War. Firstly, because Putin NEEDS the war to keep going to fuel Russia's economy now entirely dependent on war production and secondly, to also assist China is spreading the US' military assistance further.

TLDR; China, Russia and NK are all going to coordinate the biggest surprise invasions this century has ever seen, with the main objective of spreading US military as thinly as possible and ultimately, allow them to seize and annex all the countries they want. At the same time, the Russia trollfarm will probably be busy churning out the usual whataboutism propaganda on Facebook and Tiktok to sow the world's support for them instead and make it seem like it's the US' fault.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,The GOP is already eating itself alive.,"It’s official: the Republican Party is now a full-blown circus, and Trump hasn’t even been sworn in yet. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy running the *Department of Government Efficiency*, Matt Gaetz as Attorney General, and John Thune as Senate Majority Leader. This is the team? This is the plan? Watching this disaster unfold in real time is like watching a slow-motion car crash—except you can’t stop laughing.

The GOP really said, “Who’s the least qualified and most insufferable duo we can find to ‘fix’ the government?” Musk, the guy who’s been slowly burning Twitter to the ground, and Vivek, the tech bro whose only skill is talking fast and saying nothing, are now supposed to streamline federal agencies. Imagine the chaos of Musk trying to run anything more complex than a Tesla recall. And Vivek? He’s basically a LinkedIn post brought to life.

And then there’s Matt Gaetz. The guy who’s so toxic even his own party barely tolerates him is now the supported Attorney General. He has spent more time courting controversy than building allies, and now he’s supposed to oversee justice in America? The GOP might as well just hand Democrats a gift-wrapped scandal because that’s all this appointment guarantees. Even Republicans don’t want him. 

Meanwhile, the Senate is already in shambles. John Thune as Majority Leader has sent MAGA loyalists into an all-out meltdown, and Trump’s camp is panicking because Thune isn’t going to fall in line like a good little soldier.

So, to all the Republicans who spent years pretending they had it all figured out: how’s it going now? Musk and Vivek are a walking punchline. Gaetz is universally despised. Thune’s leadership has already derailed Trump’s agenda. Your “great comeback” is turning into the most entertaining self-destruction we’ve ever seen.

They’ve supported them personally, both emotionally and financially, even through all despite receiving very little back.

Now, since the election, they’ve decided to cut out everyone who voted for Trump. This includes people like his parents and cousins that voted for Trump. But that’s not all. They’re also cutting out people who aren’t following suit. So my wife, who voted for Harris, is being cut out of their lives also because she won’t stop talking to her own parents. They tried to force her to choose and now they’re just including her in their tantrum because she won’t back down.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,There are no moral differences between homosexual and incestual relationships.,"I just don't understand how we can draw the line when it comes to love, especially when no other people are affected.

Removing the factor of genetic complications in offspring-

Given a scenario where both groups are unable to reproduce, (where homosexual couples are unable to physically, and incestual couples are unable to by law) there should be no reason why one should be condemned over the other in the eyes of society.

If two people love each other, it should be nobody else's business but the people involved.

If both kinds of relationships can and do exist in nature, one should not be deemed more unnatural than the other. I believe that in a society that preaches tolerance when it comes to love, the same argument for either relationship can be interchangeably applied to the other.

Mainly that as long as both parties are up of consenting legal adults, their relationship does not harm nor affect anyone, and therefore should be allowed to come to pass.",1,1.0,0,IndignantBiases,2024-11-13 08:17:08,1gqdv39,1,Medium
TrueUnpopularOpinion,I don’t find kittens cute. ,"This post was removed from unpopular opinions so I bring it here because the discussion was nice. 

I must confess, I don’t find kittens cute. 

And that’s purely aesthetic. I find kittens ugly, their legs are thin and their bellies too round, and that thin pink skin unsettles me (the one on their bellies or armpits, and yes it’s specifically kittens)
I find their meowing kinda annoying too, that scream-meow thing that grates the ears. 

I love adult cats, I love puppies and adult dogs. 

But kittens are so weird for me, I mean, I will play and pet if I meet one and would never mistreat any animal. But they are so ugly and weird that I don’t go out of my way to interact with them

If I ever get a cat it will be an adult or senior one, because that’s specific with kittens. 

That’s NOT a hate post on kittens and NO animal should ever be mistreated no matter your personal opinion on them. Kittens are still ugly. 

Anyone agree?

So many of the posts I've read are laced with people's feelings, and perceptions on what this administration might do/not do, etc, how much worse we will all be, and a ton of speculation.  

It is my opinion that we should measure this objectively, individually.  And to do that, you should have data and a target.  We cannot rely on any MSM providing this for us, because each of the media outlets will spin the data to lean the direction they wish.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,Trump’s Ukraine peace plan suffers from the exact same problem that doomed his Palestine peace plan in 2020,"On January 28, 2020 Donald Trump unveiled what was quite possibly the most geopolitically naive plan to end a war in the history of humanity.
His plan to end the Israeli Palestinian conflict was as thus. Let Israel annex all the areas with settlements in the West Bank leaving the borders of the Palestinian state in the West Bank looking like an old splotch of paint that had fallen into Israel and been scratched away at. This would be connected to Gaza via an underground tunnel and Gaza would gain some useless spots of land in the desert along but not quite connected to the Egyptian border in exchange for the land Palestinians were to give up in the West Bank. Further more the Palestinians were to be given access to the Israeli ports in Ashdod and Haifa, and Isreal would have full control over Palestines airspace and security. Needless to say neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis had any interest whatsoever in this plan and told Trump to shove the piece of paper he presented them with where the sun don't shine. The current plan for peace Trump's team is proposing suffers from the same problem it completely ignores that demands both sides are making of each other. Ukraine wants its land back and NATO membership to guarantee security from future Russian aggression. While Russia wants complete neutrality of Ukraine, and Ukrainian disarmament. Trump's plan would have Ukraine barred from joining NATO for 20 years and the land Russia currently occupied given to Russia in exchange for a demilitarized zone patrolled by troops from NATO countries and America helping Ukraine rebuild its military. Neither Zelensky nor Putin will be able to sell this plan as a victory to their people and thus much like how Palestine and Israel reacted to Trump's plan to solve their conflict Ukraine and Russia will most likely reject this plan.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,"In Terms of Foreign Policy, Democrats & Republicans Are Almost the Same","There is a lot of hubbub and nail biting over how a Trump presidency will look in terms of foreign policy, and I'd argue this is largely misplaced.  While I'm not a Trump supporter (I never voted for him), this is simply not an issue I'm losing sleep over.

You see, the reality is there is very little difference between one president to the next in terms of foreign policy, and this includes Trump.

I realize that during campaign season, candidates say lots of things that seems to put them at odds with their opponent, but this very rarely plays out *after* they get elected.  For example, Democrats have been traditionally famous for their skepticism of free trade, only to get elected and suddenly flip on this issue to be more in line with traditional Republicans.

Clinton's foreign policy was nearly identical to Bush Sr.  His signature legislation, NAFTA, was already negotiated by his predecessor.

Likewise, Bush Jr. got elected, only to be criticized for looking too much like Bill Clinton.

Obama got elected, only to be criticized for looking too much like Bush.

Trump's first term was a radical departure by starting a trade war with China, except this was one of the few things he did that Democrats actually praised him for.

Biden got into office only to double down on pretty much all of Trump's foreign policies.

Now that Trump is coming back, lots of people are really upset he is somehow a Putin puppet.  This seems very unlikely for at least a couple of different reasons.

First, his appointment of both Rubio and Hegseth is an indication that Trump will continue to support Ukraine.  Some people are upset over his criticisms of NATO, but I personally think most of this rhetoric is justified.  Our allies in Europe have been leeching off of American military support for far too long and need to do more themselves.

Second, America's most important leverage points would be to expand domestic energy production and to strengthen the military, both of which Trump has always been a huge fan of.

So there you have it.  There are many different viable issues to criticize the Bad Orange Man.  Foreign policy really shouldn't be at the top of your list.  After all, he kind of behaves like a Democrat, who behaves like a Republican.",0,0.38,17,snuffy_bodacious,2024-11-13 09:59:29,1gqg5ne,17,High

TrueUnpopularOpinion,"if england made a revolutionary war movie where the colonists were portrayed as depraved monsters, americans would be out for their blood.

the patriot is symptomatic of a bigger problem with america. this rose tinted view of the american revolution. where the colonists were always right and the british were always wrong. where the colonists were the good guys and the british were the bad guys. the actual truth of the matter is that it was actually the other way around. i'm sure that you were all taught about how the colonists fought for independence against england. but, what i doubt you were taught was that the colonists poured boiling hot tar on tax collectors. i'm sure you were taught about the boston massacre but i'm sure that your teachers conveniently left out the bit where the colonists were antagonizing the soldiers and then hung a black man who testified against them during the court case. and that's not even getting into what pieces of shit the founding fathers were. george washington was a cruel slave owner, thomas jefferson was a child rapist, benjamin franklin was a deadbeat dad, alexander hamilton was a pervert, john hancock was a smuggler. elbridge gerry is literally the namesake for the term gerrymandering, a process that gives one political party an unfair and undue advantage. none of that was mentioned in the patriot.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,Men being unable to overcome their gender roles in capitalism is a major reason why the system itself isn't overcome,"This post has a communist inclination and presupposes the need to overcome capitalism. It's also a summarization of previous, incomplete theories I made which nevertheless connected themselves in a fundamental point, and I've found this was capitalist logic. This post does not consider capitalism is ""just markets"", nor that political power isn't held by those with money.

First, I assume you understand that both Progressives/Liberals and Reactionaries are pro-capitalism, with Progressives being the sanctimonious part of it which poses generally valid problems created by capitalist logic itself, but doesn't offer a totalizing solution for them; rather, it creates fake ones which often involve the need for constant consumption, hence why they're ultimately favorable to markets.

With that being said, I position that women's gender role issues are used as the horizon of progress by liberals not out of benevolence on their part, but rather the convenient position of women in capitalism, which allows for the aforementioned incompleteness of solutions to be exploited with reformism and pink money.

To further explain: since women represent a universally oppressed group based on their gender (emphasis on represent because there are burgeois women), they *only* show the symptom of capitalism and patriarchy; men, on the other hand, represent not only the symptom, but the inherent contradiction of capital exploitation, which's why they occupy both the very top AND the margins of society.

Focusing on this contradiction on men's side is a very important tactic for class consciousness, as it alludes the question of *which* men have privileges. Such distinction is exactly what capitalist founders of gender propaganda don't want, since their whole point is to cause this perpetual war between working class men and women by making them think one gender can only benefit in spite of/after the other (austerity and trickle-down economics), thus unable to overcome their roles with a universal political motion. So, they'll instead pretend to care about their own mess by targetting women's symptoms instead, for that causes a collective moral panic, increases profit, and dissolves the distinction between both classes in men to categorize all symptoms on the masculine side reactionary in essence, therefore leading working class men to stand for reactionary politics, hoping to be heard - a self-fulfilling prophecy.

**TL;DR:** gender propaganda is founded by capitalists with enough political power, and is meant to maximize biological divergences and social stereotypes not only to engage consumption, but also scapegoat the masculine gender role without addressing its contradiction, as that prevents society to aim properly at the elites.

A lot of working-class men are going reactionary because they notice progressives' hypocrisy towards their gender role problems, accusing them of being privileged by capitalism when they feel like anything but. It's important for the left (and with that I mean, anti-capitalists) to seize that contradiction showing those men how their issues can be overcome with an alternative system (socialism), rather than expecting them to take a more liberal stand, as they have nothing to win from it - women at least have the *pretense* of a solution.",0,0.2,19,Grand_Convergence,2024-11-13 08:36:03,1gqe9fe,19,High

Every single time the court throw the book there protest about letting literal murders and routine robbers get years in prison but a youtubers pays his artists and speeds so he deserves years in prison. Again he deserves a ticket, issue a public a statement as a public figure with influence, and should stop making those types of videos for a while. That all fair but the people acting like him making a paid app is the worst thing ever or him speeding (when it estimated that 80% of the US population speeds Daily) should be the end of his career is the stupidest thing I seen. He needs to be careful about letting money get to his head but I watch his career since almost the beginning and there so much worse out there.",0,0.24,18,maxxor6868,2024-11-13 09:13:20,1gqf37o,18,High
TrueUnpopularOpinion,Socialism doesn’t really exist ,"Never once has there been a socialist nation in the world, almost every single one of ends up communist or is more social Democrat. The simple issue with it is it’s too moderate for radicals and to radical for moderates, it’s the equivalent of a half measure. Almost every socialist state is has failed at being socialist 

USSR, become communist
China, turned into a communist ethnic state (literally 1984)
Vietnam, actually the best example but more or less has shifted towards a Social Democrat dictatorship.
Cambodia, pol pot happened 
Socialism is like a fire, it either becomes communism and burns everything down, or moderates until it doesn’t exist. 

Hell socialism is actually more or less a community based system, based on small communities with many small governments and most likely a larger governmental body, kind of like native Americans, or is it a system based on workers holding means of production? Or is it a  centralized national government system with high taxes and lots of benefits? Who tf know, except of course the socialist, which one? Well they both give different answers.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,Nick Fuentes is a nobody from nowhere and you should just ignore him.,"No, it is not complacency to ignore people like this. This turd of a person is just looking for attention, his entire existence is basically a joke, and you should be able to spot a piece of crap like him from orbit. But the moment you dox, or even react to the stupid shit he says you give him what he wants. Even more worrisome is that if someone else gets hurt because he was doxxed that’s on the people who doxxed him. Your attention is what he craves and where he gets his supposed “power” it is easy to take away from him. But the moment you try to hurt him, you martyr him. 

It really should go without saying that you don’t need to stoop to his level. It’s tempting, but it’s unproductive. ",155,0.83,120,Key_Squash_4403,2024-11-11 14:59:19,1gp30o8,275,High

As long as it is used for informational purposes, it is not a big problem. A poster hanging in a classroom doesn’t hurt anybody.

Of course, teachers should not force any religion on the students. It should solely serve an educational and informative purpose, to teach kids **ABOUT** the religion, not teach the religion itself. 

And yes, any religious text, not just Christianity, should be allowed as long as it is for an EDUCATIONAL purpose. ",0,0.33,61,epicap232,2024-11-13 07:51:42,1gqdc5j,61,High
TrueUnpopularOpinion,cutting off loved ones who voted for trump is actually a valid thing to do.,"in the past couple of days, there have been numerous posts on this sub condemning people who cut off loved ones who voted for trump. but now, i think it's time for me to say my peace on the subject. i think that this is actually a good thing to do.

donald trump is a horrible human being. he has said and done some absolutely horrible things. he said that john mccain wasn't a war hero, claimed that all mexicans are rapists, openly bragged about sexuality assaulting women, horribly mishandled COVID, and instigated an insurrection after he lost in 2020. anyone who would vote for someone like that a second time is not someone that i would want to have in my life and i doubt that i'm the only person who feels that way. 

not to mention all the horrible things that trump is going to do while he's in office. he plans to strip women's right to choose from them, plans to remove anti discrimination laws that protect T people, plans to call in the military to stamp out protests, plans to take a battering ram to environmental laws, and this is only the stuff that he's said. anyone who would vote for someone like that is someone who i would be more then happy to show the door.

yesterday, there was a post on this sub where a man said that his brother in law is T. in the aftermath of the election, the brother in law and his wife have opted to cut off any family member who voted for trump. this includes the FIL and the MIL, two people who decided that having their cheeto messiah back in office was more important then the safety and well being of their son. i commented on that post, saying that while i agree that the BIL and his wife overreacted by cutting off anyone who refuses to cut off the parents, the parents have shown where their priorities lie and i don't blame the BIL one bit for wanting nothing to do with them going forward. 

if i could, i would cut off my trump supporting uncle and aunt as well. however, the uncle is my grandmother's brother and my dad's uncle so i will tolerate them both for their sake. but i will not actively engage with them and, if i am hosting a party, they will be excluded. i will also no longer be accepting gifts from them. any birthday or christmas money i recieve from them will either go to charity or will be given to my mom for groceries. 

to the trump supporters on this sub who's loved ones have cut them off, i sincerely hope that this causes you to love inward and rethink your priorities. your backwards way of thinking is no longer going to be tolerated. your loved ones have basically told you that you need to decide who's more important to you. donald trump or them? if you want a relationship with us going forward, you better get real liberal and you better get it soon.",0,0.21,72,herequeerandgreat,2024-11-13 07:53:07,1gqdd53,72,High
TrueUnpopularOpinion,"Since trump already broke his first campaign promise, it's clear he's going to be a weak president","I'm a center-left independent and could vote for a republican or democrat based on certain policy. Especially anti war. I liked that trump was confident about ending wars, including his promise to end the Ukraine war within 24 hours of him being ""president elect"" (his words).

I didn't vote for him because it was obvious (if you're paying attention) thay he was only saying what people wanted to hear to get votes. 

It's been a week and he hasn't been able to keep this first promise. This says a lot. It should be a wake up call to his hardcore supporters. 

Either he lied or he's weak.",0,0.33,24,programmer_farts,2024-11-13 05:11:08,1gqaiy1,24,High
TrueUnpopularOpinion,The 4B stuff is massive projection from left-wing women,"When last guy left office, the Abraham accords have largely fallen out in favor of war, the only 4 years Russia didn't seize new territory were swapped for the largest ground war in Europe, it's not an exaggeration to say the minute Trump left office the world caught on fire.

Around 80-90% of abortions are for entirely elective reasons depending on the study.

The massive groups of people that voted with this as their number one issue, genuinely care more about sex (specifically one night stands) than literal fields of burning bodies. 

Accusing the right or men in general of voting for ""sex"" or ""to force women into sex"" as I've seen posted all over so many certain subreddits, is pure projection.

The people I this 4B movement has sex as their #1 issue, they genuinely can't fathom that for other people that's actually very much not the case.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,You should be able to search for specific animals near your home,"I am not sure this is unpopular. I wanted to take pictures with some sheep around, so I searched Yelp for “sheep” and got restaurants that served lamb, not like, farms or parks with petting zoos. Hopefully we can gauge the popularity of this idea on Reddit and get some developers working on this. Need a goat? Just plug in “goat” and see a variety of local goats. Also helpful for reporting waterways with alligators or friendly outdoor cats. We could include ratings and reviews of animals.",3,0.71,17,ImprovementPutrid441,2024-11-12 10:07:48,1gpo75q,20,High
