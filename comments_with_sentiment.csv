How long have you been on r/WritingPrompts? I joined this morning.

Bad writing habits? I typically avoid dialogue or copy it from canon if what I'm writing is fanfiction, which is no way to get better at writing dialogue. I also typically write short scenes and not full stories - I'm just vibing I guess

I use 4thewords to make myself write, although sometimes that counteracts the whole point because I'll draft my Reddit comment on the site to defeat a monster, which is writing but not really *writing.* ",Relevant_Maybe6747,18684,[OT] SatChat: Do you have any bad writing habits?

WritingPrompts,"#Life on the Farm  

WC 547 

My least favorite chore was butchering. As a farm girl,  I had a strong connection to the animals we raised and even though I knew what they were there for, I never wanted to kill, especially not such interesting animals.  

Thankfully the only place I was supposed to butcher was way out back behind the pens just before the corn fields which were used for feed. We raised hogs mostly, and many times when I would be asked to go fetch a hog for a customer, I’d pardon it instead and set it free to roam the corn fields and hopefully find a life of happiness out in the wild.  

We had other animals too, of course. Hell, our barns were crowded with chickens, turkeys, ducks, and a disgruntled old horse. I figured the turkeys should stay outside considering how messy they were, but Ma and Pa insisted we keep them all locked up.  

They kept me locked up too. I know I had a few acres to roam, but it felt like a prison with only a collection of farm animals to keep me company (five hundred and twelve if you count all the chicks). It would have been a lonely life if people didn’t constantly trespass onto our property.  

I met David when he was looking for his lost dog and stumbled onto the property. There was something about him that made me pause and take a different approach than I normally would with strangers. I walked up to him, smiled, and asked what brought him onto our land.  

“Just looking for my dog,” he said in a casual tone that matched his relaxed smile and twinkling eyes. I decided to show him around the farm and talk to him while we looked for his lost dog. He seemed at ease and his heartfelt laugh made me smile, eventually joining in to laugh alongside him.  

“Here’s the hog pens,” I said, guiding him through the maze of fences.  

I saw his nose wrinkle and thought it was because of the dreary color.  

“Lots of mud, I guess.”   

“Yeah. And the smell.” He said.  

“I don’t really notice. But a girl gets tired of the color brown. It’s all mud out here and all dried blood in the butcher shed.”  

“You do the butchering?” He seemed shocked.  

“Yeah.”  

“That’s awful. I can’t imagine having to kill these hogs.”  

“Oh,” I said, “I don’t kill many hogs. I like to set them free instead.”  

“That’s nice of you.”  

My face flushed and I turned to him with a smile. He had a lovely face, but it was crinkled again. He seemed deep in thought.  

“But… then how do y’all stay in business.”  

I shrugged. “Selling meat.”  

I swung open the shed door and let him see what I meant about the dried blood. Normally I would try to salvage the clothes of trespassers but the blood got everywhere and ruined all of the garments and shoes.  

His face paled and he stood frozen at the entryway before rapidly making his excuses and running out into the cornfield.  

I reluctantly grabbed the rifle off of its perch.  

It was a shame, I really did like him. But just like he said, the farm has to stay in business.",throwthisoneintrash,9741,[CW] Smash 'Em Up Sunday - For the Love of Fall,"#**Welcome back to Smash ‘Em Up Sunday!**

WritingPrompts,"Something I wrote a while back.

***

In the dim light of pre-dawn, Gordon had successfully negotiated the truly impressive media hordes outside, entered the City Hall building, and marched into the Mayor's office.

Not surprisingly, the D.A. was also there.

""Gordon.""

""We'd like a progress report.""

Gordon adjusted his glasses. ""A few hours ago, one Helena Bertinelli, a.k.a. the Huntress, walked up to the Joker, who was unarmed, and promptly shot a crossbow bolt through his head. In front of seven witnesses, five who are long-serving police officers, and two security cameras.""

The D.A. unsuccessfully suppressed a laugh. ""My kid's got a photo of that on his desktop.""

Gordon nodded. ""Needless to say, with the evidence, we've got a slam-dunk. No need for any deals or whatever. Throw away the key on her.""

The Mayor and the D.A. gave each other a glance before looking back at Gordon.

""It's not that simple.""

""Dead to rights."" When the two officials refused to react, Gordon felt the need to elaborate. ""This is murder.""

""That was the Joker.""

""Murder One.""

The D.A. looked Gordon square in the eye. ""Murder is usually defined as the killing of a human being.""

Gordon removed his glasses for a quick polish. ""Are you justifying murder?""

""Are you justifying a waste of the city's time and money, Commissioner?""

""I don't follow.""

The Mayor rubbed his nose. ""Okay Commissioner, let me look into my crystal ball, and give you a rundown of the future."" He stood up, gesturing as he spoke.

""Right now, Ms. Bertinelli is sitting in your cells, waiting. Outside your cells, people in Gotham are just hearing on the news, TV, radio, whatever way or network they use on the Internet, that finally, the Joker is dead.""

""I expec-""

""Don't interrupt, Gordon, because I haven't even started. However, Ms. Bertinelli's supporters are already off and running. Bill?""

The D.A. produced one of those iPads. ""A website for her legal defence funds. Thirty-thousand contributed – not pledged, contributed - in two and a half hours.""

""What?""

""Yeah, and the news hasn't hit the major morning shows yet. But I suspect that she won't need a penny, because every major criminal lawyer on the East Coast is ready to pay her for the opportunity to defend the next big hero in court.""

The D.A. leaned forward. ""Every one of my major guns is taking a vacation, taking leave or calling sick because they realise that being put on the docket as the one who prosecuted the girl who killed the Joker will be a major albatross around their neck should they ever harbour anything resembling a political ambition. Which means I will definitely have to strongarm one of my more younger, more inexperienced, more common-sense-challenged attorneys. And if Ms. Bertinelli's legal team possesses an ounce of competence? They'll have figured that out already.""

The Mayor shrugged. ""But let's say we say the hell with it and plow on ahead. They'll insist on a jury trial here in Gotham, even though we have the death penalty. That means you'll have a presiding judge who may not have been personally threatened by laughing boy, but is close friends with at least one member of the bench who has, and therefore will be looking for the slightest excuse to say 'Case Dismissed, Sorry to bother you Ma'am'.""

""Then Jury selection. Despite every juror swearing blind they want to preserve the rule of law, you'll have two people who were nearby when Joker blew up a building. One who was put directly in harm's way. Two who knew someone who was hurt, threatened or killed, one guy who will still be hung over because of the parties that will be thrown to celebrate Ms. Bertinelli's welcome subtraction from the gene pool and at least one whose daughter caught a whiff of that Joker Venom stuff and had to spend her college fund on plastic surgery so she won't look like a grinning freak-""

""Smilex."" Gordon muttered. ""The inhalational variant of Joker Venom is Smilex.""

""Whoop. De. Do.""

The D.A. stood up. ""Tell me Gordon. Given the amount of your officers killed or seriously injured by the Joker, can you guarantee the evidence against Ms. Bertinelli will not be tampered with, if not mysteriously disappear or misfiled?""

Gordon took a deep shuddering breath. ""Are you trying to tell me we're just going to let a woman – a woman with long established Mafia connections walk away from a murder charge?""

""We are going to save this city from a very needless and public waste of time and money.""

Gordon finally made the connection. ""And preventing the very public and undoubtedly famous trial, a trial which you've already pre-determined that Ms. Bertinelli will win, won't create a nationally famous figurehead in this woman, who undoubtedly amid her book offers and TV spots, will consider a shot at public office?""

""Interesting imagination you have there, Gordon.""

""You truly inspire me, sir.""

As the D.A. began to state that Bertinelli had already been released, Gordon didn't bother with pleasantries as he left the office.

He'd already failed the negotiations.",adriantullberg,75323,"[EU] Someone manages to actually murder the Joker. Batman catches them and brings them to justice easily, but there's one problem, the Jury refuses to convict them.",,387,2024-11-13 18:51:42,0.033284409654272686,2024-11-13

In return, the sheep will “howl” at the moon with their shepherd and protect his modesty when he eventually changes back.","[Original Prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1g8usyy/wp_a_werewolf_makes_a_living_as_a_shepherd/) by /u/Straight_Attention_5  
  
The ancient barn seemed unremarkable at first glance. Its weathered boards groaned and creaked in the wind. Its dilapidated roof shone a dull gray in the light of the full moon. The scent of fresh hay wafted from within, filling the crisp night air. It appeared so normal, in fact, that it took some time before the small crowd gathered outside noticed anything was amiss.  
  
“By god,” hissed Mayor Gorland, keeping his voice low. “Look at the doors.”  
  
To his left, Farmer Joseph frowned. The barn’s doors seemed normal enough. A little thicker than strictly necessary, sure, but nothing especially nefarious. He turned to the mayor. “Seem fine to me,” he said uncertainly. “Locked up for the night, like any of us would do. What’s wrong with ‘em?”  
  
“Oh, they’re locked alright,” said the mayor. Then he stepped forward, raising his torch to cast more light on the front of the barn. “But they’re barred from the inside.”  
  
Joseph cursed under his breath, taking a step back and gripping his pitchfork tight. All around him, the other villagers began to mutter angrily amongst themselves.  
  
The mayor lifted a hand to quell them. “Steady, lads. If he’s holed up inside, it means we’ve got him cornered. Nobody do anything daft.”   
  
He cleared his throat, then called out in a clear voice that echoed across the field. “Brandon Tamwick!” he shouted. “We’ve come to talk!”  
  
From inside the barn, a few sheep bleated in response. The crowd outside was deathly silent.  
  
“We know you’re in there, Tamwick!” he shouted again.  
  
More bleating. Then a quiet rustling, as if someone was shuffling their way through a thick layer of hay. Farmer Joseph’s knuckles whitened on his pitchfork.  
  
“Mayor Gorland?” came a wary voice from just beyond the door. “That you out there?”  
  
“Aye, son,” said the mayor. “You come on out, now. We’ve got some questions for you.”  
  
There was a long pause. Then a sniffing noise, like a beast scenting the air.  
  
“Some other folks with you?”  
  
The mayor looked back over his shoulder. A dozen villagers—each carrying a torch and the sharpest farm tool they could find—eyed the door nervously.  
  
“A few, yes,” he said. “Seems there’s been some talk of a werewolf in these parts. Couple’a animals gone missing. People pointing fingers.” He cleared his throat again and turned back to face the barn. “We’re just trying to get to the bottom of it, son. You understand.”  
  
A long, tired sigh came through the barred double doors.  
  
“Yeah,” said Tamwick eventually. “Yeah, I understand.”  
  
The mayor nodded. “Good lad,” he said. “So… so you just step out here, nice and easy-like, and we’ll take you to see the judge. He’s a learned man. Studied books and such. You pass his tests, and we can all put this behind us as a big misunderstanding.”  
  
He waited.  
  
“Tamwick?” he called. “You hear what I’m saying? If you ain’t what people say, you got nothing to be afraid of. You have my word.”  
  
There was a small, defeated chuckle from the other side of the doors. “I appreciate that, mayor. I really do.” An awkward pause. Then: “Thing is, my flock’s all settled down for the night. It’d disturb ‘em something fierce to open the doors now. I already lost one sheep last month, so they’re nervous as it is. Can I… can I come see you in the morning?”  
  
The crowd’s muttering turned darker. The mayor raised his hand again.  
  
“Afraid I can’t do that, son,” he said. “Unbar those doors for us, now. No reason this has to turn ugly.”  
  
“I…” Tamwick paused, his voice catching. “I can’t, sir. It’s not safe. Please, just—”  
  
“I knew it!” yelled someone from the back of the crowd. “It is him! He’s the beast!”  
  
“Shut yer hole, Marvin Briggs!” barked the mayor. But already, similar cries were rising from the crowd to join the first. The foremost townsfolk moved closer to the door, weapons ready.  
  
“This is your last chance, Tamwick!”  
  
“You open that door, or we’ll come in there and drag you out!”  
  
“Stop!” shouted the mayor. “Let the boy talk!”  
  
He thought he heard another shout from inside the barn, but it was drowned out by the rising tide of rage that swirled around him. A dozen scared and angry men converged on the barn doors and began to throw their weight against them, causing them to buckle dangerously.  
  
“God damn you, I said get back!” cried the mayor. “We don’t know for sure, yet! If you—”  
  
There was a loud crack as the crossbar snapped in half. The crowd paused, each reluctant to be the first to enter, and backed nervously away from the doors as they creaked slowly open.  
  
In the shadows of the barn, Brandon Tamwick stood surrounded by his sheep. His shoulders were slumped as he looked down at his feet.  
  
“I just…” he sniffled. “I just wanted to keep them safe,” he said. “You can’t get sick, once you’re bitten. You heal faster, too. I thought… I thought it would keep them safe.”  
  
The mayor’s eyes narrowed. “What are you talking about, son?” he said. “Keep who safe?”  
  
The young man didn’t seem to hear him. He spoke to the ground, his voice bitter with regret.  
  
“I’ve never lost one before, you know? They listen to me. I’m the head of the pack. But then that storm, last month—and poor Clover, she panicked and ran off…”  
  
He looked up. “I’ve been out every night, trying to find her. I swear it. I didn’t think she’d hurt anybody.” He sniffled again, the tears in his eyes catching the torchlight from the mob. “I’m so sorry.”  
  
At his side, the first of the flock stepped curiously out into the moonlight. And as its hoof left the shadows of the barn, it became a massive, hairy paw.  
  
“Oh, son,” whispered the mayor. “You *didn’t*.”",83,2024-11-13 22:43:17,0.4121212121212121,2024-11-13

TrueOffMyChest,Very interested in reclaiming my virginity. How long does it take to get a decision after submitting an application?,Ok-Algae8510,23700,Want to fulfill all your wildest dreams? Become a Reddit mod!,"Picture this: You're soul searching in between jobs, enjoying the single life to discover your inner self and allowing your mother to live above you and all you ask her for in exchange is a daily delivery of dino chicken nuggies and a refreshing bottle of mountain dew. It all sounds perfect, right? So why does it feel like something's missing? Well look no further because we have the solution for you...

**Reddit Moderation!**

What could more perfectly complement your fulfilling lifestyle than playing internet cop on Reddit? See a post you disagree with? You can delete it! User making valid points and hurting your feelings in modmail? Mute them! Having a bad day? Just ban a random, unsuspecting individual!

`**Disclaimer for Mod Code of Conduct purposes: you can't actually do any of this`

On to more serious matters,

We are in need of more moderators to help maintain the subreddit. No experience is needed. All we ask is that you have the time, patience and a good sense of humor. Our team will be available to train you and answer any questions you have. Communication is a *must* and really, why wouldn't you want to talk to us? You'll be placed on a probationary period to start and we fully understand that mistakes will be made and activity may fluctuate. Please note that being selected as a mod does not guarantee you will be a permanent addition. Not everyone is a good fit and that's okay.

So what does moderating actually entail?

* Clearing the queue will be your #1 task. The queue is where you'll see any content that has been reported or our automod has flagged for review. All you have to do is go through it, read the content and decide whether to remove it, approve it and sometimes report or ban a user. The queue fills up *fast* and needs a lot of attention. Seriously, some of you need to lay off the spam reports.
* Modmail is your next task. It's mostly users asking why their post is missing (automod ate it 99% of the time) and asking that you fix it. We also recieve ban appeals here. If you're lucky, you'll get a death threat every now and then. Hooray! If any modmails are uncomfortable, too personal or upsetting to you, you can delegate it to another mod.
* Sometimes a post will come up that's especially spicy or attracting a lot of attention. When this happens, one of our mods likes to comb through the comments for violations or sit on it to monitor incoming comments for violations. If it gets too much to handle, or someone isn't available, you can lock it.
* Communicating with the team is one of the most important tasks in your role as a moderator. As a team, we discuss moderation actions, rule changes, sub events and the direction of the subreddit. That all sounds very boring but rest assured, there's a lot more casual talk than anything else so feel free to chime in on Beaver's dislike of garlic bread (encouraged), Tim sharing new sanrio drops or my Call of Duty K/D ratio.
* Lastly, let's talk about the meta. Sometimes things need doing on the sub, like this recruitment post I was supposed to make months ago. While the day to day is important, we also need to keep the sub up to date with new features and tools and update it to fit the growing userbase.

If you managed to get through all that, congrats! You made it to the actual app, which is also long and annoying. Here's a tip for applying: there is a short quiz portion to the app. We don't care if you get everything right, we just want to see your line of reasoning and understanding of the rules and subreddit culture.

TrueOffMyChest,Fuck your rules 🗣,SuperBeavers1,41070,Reminder - We are not a political subreddit - Posts about the election will be removed.,"Rule 7 (Posts must be personal) still exists.

No, your hot takes about the election, whether celebratory or gloomy, are not what this subreddit is for.

No, you whining about how much you have to see posts about the election is not what this subreddit is for.  Also, you're playing yourself when you do that.

No, making a post titled ""WWIII"" to bypass the filter (which includes both Trump and Harris) won't convince us to leave your post up.

There are many, many places to talk about the election on and off of reddit.  This is not one of them.  We've had dozens, possibly hundreds of posts removed.  Given that nobody reads these pinned posts or the rules on the side, I expect we'll have dozens to hundreds more!

Sorry, you can't post pictures of muscle cars in /r/musclecats.  This is about keeping the subreddit on topic.

> ""You should just allow every post, ever!""

Imagine if the OnlyFans bots could post and the mods weren't allowed to remove them.

NoSleep,Don't let him in. Never let them in.,MizMeowMeow,494,I wish I never waved to the man who watched me…,"Every evening at precisely 10:00 p.m., the man appeared in the window across from mine.

I first noticed him on a foggy October night. I was pacing around my tiny apartment, trying to work out a problem for a client, when my gaze wandered to the old building across the street. Through the dim haze, I could just make out a figure, barely visible, framed in the dusty glass of an upstairs window.

At first, I thought nothing of it. He was probably just a neighbor, taking a quick look outside. But the next night, at exactly 10:00 p.m., there he was again, standing in that same spot, staring into the street. Something about the way he stood made my skin crawl. His face was barely visible, shrouded in shadow, but I could make out the pale outline of his eyes. He was watching me.

I closed the blinds that night, uneasy. But every evening after that, no matter how hard I tried to ignore him, I felt his presence. Curiosity—or perhaps a growing sense of dread—got the better of me. Each night, I would watch the clock, my heart pounding, until the hour struck ten.

And there he would be.

Days turned into weeks, and the man never missed a night. Always standing in the same spot, in the same eerie, unbroken silence. He never waved, never moved, just watched, as though waiting for something.

One night, I decided to wave to him. I wanted to see if he’d respond. As soon as the clock hit ten, I pulled back the blinds and raised my hand, hesitantly, toward the window.

His eyes met mine, and for a brief moment, I thought he was going to lift his own hand. Instead, his lips curled into a small, unsettling smile, revealing darkened, uneven teeth. My skin prickled. I quickly closed the blinds, trying to shake off the creeping chill that had settled over me.

That was the first night I heard him.

I had just started drifting off to sleep when a faint tapping echoed through my apartment. My eyes snapped open, heart hammering. The tapping was steady, deliberate, like someone lightly rapping their knuckles against glass. I lay frozen, listening, trying to place the sound.

Tap… tap… tap…

It was coming from my window.

Slowly, dreading what I might see, I turned toward it. Through the thin fabric of my blinds, I could make out a shadowy outline standing on the fire escape outside my apartment. A face pressed close to the glass, a wide, toothy smile just barely visible through the slats.

My blood ran cold.

I wanted to scream, but I was paralyzed. I squeezed my eyes shut, hoping it was just my imagination, that the man in the window was only a trick of the light, a shadow cast by passing cars.

The tapping grew louder, more insistent.

Tap… tap… tap…

Somehow, I managed to bolt upright, grabbing my phone and dialling 911 with trembling fingers. The dispatcher answered, her voice a steady anchor in the dark. I whispered, terrified he might hear me, that there was someone on my fire escape.

Within minutes, I heard the wail of sirens. I didn’t dare open my eyes until I felt the reassuring presence of the police officers. They searched the fire escape, the alley, the entire building, but found nothing. No footprints, no fingerprints, nothing to indicate anyone had been there at all.

The officer suggested it was just a nightmare, a figment of my imagination. But I knew what I’d seen. I could still feel the weight of his gaze, the pressure of his face pressed against my window.

That night, I barely slept, the man’s smile haunting my every thought.

The next day, I tried to convince myself it was over, that he wouldn’t return. But as the clock struck ten, I found myself unable to resist looking out the window.

He was there, staring back at me from across the street. This time, he looked different. His face was somehow clearer, his features sharper, more defined. His eyes were glassy and dull, his skin pale and stretched tight over his bones. And there was something else. He was holding up a piece of paper against the glass.

It was a small, yellowed scrap, crinkled around the edges. I squinted, trying to read the faint, scrawled words.

“I’m watching.”

I stumbled back, heart racing. But when I looked again, the note was gone. The man was gone. The window across the street was empty, as though he had never been there at all.

For days, I waited, dreading the hour of ten o’clock. The silence gnawed at me, filling my mind with dread. But after a week, when he didn’t reappear, I began to hope that maybe it was over.

One night, weeks later, I was drifting off to sleep when a loud knock jolted me awake. I froze, straining my ears, praying I’d imagined it.

Knock… knock… knock…

The sound was coming from my front door.

My heart raced as I forced myself to get up, creeping slowly toward the door. As I got closer, I could hear something—a faint, rasping whisper, barely audible through the thick wood.

“Let me in.”

The whisper was dry, hollow, like dead leaves scraping against pavement. I backed away, shaking. I turned on every light in my apartment, trying to drown out the darkness, the growing terror that filled me.

The knocking continued, steady, rhythmic, unyielding.

“Let me in.”

Desperate, I dialed the police again, but by the time they arrived, the knocking had stopped. The officers looked at me with pity, clearly doubting my story. They left soon after, telling me to call if I had any more “trouble.”

For hours, I sat in silence, barely breathing, waiting for the knocking to start again.

But it didn’t. I never heard it again.

A few days later, I noticed the building across the street was empty. No lights, no movement. It was as though the place had been abandoned. Curious—and maybe a little desperate for closure—I went over to ask around, hoping to learn something about the man in the window.

The landlord, an elderly woman, looked at me with wide eyes when I mentioned him.

“No one’s lived there for months,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “The last tenant… well, he disappeared. The police never found him. The only thing they found in the apartment was a note left on his window. It said, ‘I’m watching.’”

Her words chilled me to the core. That night, as I lay in bed, I realized something.

I could still feel his eyes on me, watching from somewhere unseen, waiting for the moment I’d let him in.

NoSleep,"“FUCKING RUN,” Blake shouted. He’d sensed the danger and gone the other way around the stairs to find me.

\-> You meant Logan here?",Plungermaster9,2403,"Growing up, we weren't allowed to look at Grandma during her 'Golden Hour'. I wish I never found out why.","At the front door Mom hesitated, drew a deep breath, and said, “Okay, has everybody still got their blindfolds?”

“Noooooo,” my brother Logan replied sarcastically. “I lost mine since you asked three seconds ago.”

Logan *hated* the safety lectures we got whenever we visited Grandma. He was thirteen and I was ten, both tall and stocky with a shock of blond hair.

Mom’s eyes narrowed at him. “Logan, how about you drop the attitude? Like I haven’t got enough on my plate already.”

“My blindfold’s right here,” I said, tapping my forehead before another argument broke out.

“Good boy Blake. We’ll be in and out in twenty minutes, I promise.”

“Then we’re getting Burger King right?”

“Absolutely,” she said with a bright smile. I punched the air while Logan muttered something too low to hear. A special treat like Burger King was a huge deal to me back then.

Our grandparents’ house lay in the centre of a dirt lot surrounded by a chain-link fence. All the curtains were taped shut. Mom rapped the door, then we waited there for a few minutes while rain hammered the gutters like a steel drum. I remember worrying we’d stand there until Grandma’s ‘golden hour’ started.

Mom grabbed a ring of keys from her bag and undid the series of locks, then we stepped into the musty air of the house, shaking water from our coats and jackets. All the tacky upholstered furniture was already outdated, even back then, and the walls were covered with shelves displaying Grandpa’s prized model car collection.

Usually, Logan and I stood on the welcome mat while Mom battened down the hatches, but past the stairs and to the left, smoke was pouring out from beneath the kitchen door. Mom rushed along the corridor into the kitchen, followed closely by Blake and I. The downstairs landing wrapped around the stairs, with the kitchen at the back of the house.

On the stove, a fry pan was spurting with giant flames as Grandma, completely unaware of the danger, tried to scramble some eggs. Mom yanked the pan off the grill just as an alarm started shrieking. She shouted for us to get Grandma out of there, waving away most of the smoke with a set of oven mitts.

Dressed in her pink nightgown, Grandma fought us every step of the way, swiping at the air with her long, yellow nails. I was afraid of using too much force because her frail body always made me picture a skeleton. In the lounge, she refused to settle on a plastic-covered sofa—everything was shrink-wrapped, really—until Logan promised he’d make her a corned beef sandwich if she behaved, speaking in the soft tones you’d use around a fussy toddler.

Shortly after the alarm quieted, Mom came in and said to Grandma, “Where’s Dad? He didn’t answer the door.”

“Eugh, don’t speak to me about that man. I was washing the dog but he kept climbing away.”

“Grandma and Grandpa got a dog?” I whispered to Logan.

“No dickhead. Grandma’s nuts, remember?”

“Logan,” Mom snapped. She *insisted* we refer to Grandma’s problems as her ‘funny spells’.

Once it became obvious nobody could coax any sense out of the old lady, Mom went to find Grandpa herself. We’d barely had time to sit when she screamed from a room upstairs. Logan and I exchanged a look of concern then rushed after her.

Grandpa was sprawled across the bathroom floor, groaning. A shower curtain which had been ripped off its hooks covered his midsection, and blood oozed from a deep gash along his forehead staining the tiled floor red. He’d slipped while climbing out of the tub. Him and Mom had endless arguments about that house being a death trap but he refused to move. He was afraid what might’ve happened if they moved someplace filled with nosey neighbours.

Mom shouted for me to call an ambulance. I rushed downstairs but the rotary phone in the landing spat a dead tone. I figured the storm knocked out the lines.

“It’s not working,” I said as I rushed back.

Mom pinched the bridge of her nose and sobbed while Logan and I stood there. Kids aren’t great at processing those sorts of situations. She told Logan to help her get Grandpa into a bathrobe hanging from a nearby rack.

“Ew, gross,” Logan sneered.

“NOW!” Mom’s sudden outburst upset me more than all the blood. She rarely raised her voice.

She told me to help with the doors. Grandpa must’ve noticed me shaking, because he forced a smile and said, “I tell you Blake, this getting old business ain’t for the faint-hearted.”

He spoke as if he’d just had five glasses of whiskey, all sluggish and lazy.

Logan and Mom helped him outside into the family Volvo, all four of us getting drenched.

“Alright, everybody in the car,” she said, panting heavily.

“I’m not leaving Helena,” Grandpa protested from the passenger seat. “She needs somebody to keep an eye on her.”

Mom’s hand shot up out of frustration. She took a moment to compose herself, checked her watch, and then said, “Okay, you boys stay here while I take Grandpa to hospital. Grandma’s gonna be fine for another three hours. I’ll be back before then, but keep your blindfolds close just in case. Logan, you’re in charge. Set your electric watch thingy for a quarter to nine so you don’t forget.”

“That’s okay, I’ll rememb—""

“JUST FUCKING DO IT,” she screamed as she climbed into the car, slamming the door shut behind her.

As we watched her drive off, I told myself there was no reason to freak out. We’d stayed with Grandma during her golden hour many times.

*Yeah, before her ‘funny spells’* a voice at the back of my mind added…

“Are we still getting Burger King?” I asked Logan after Mom’s Volvo disappeared. He rolled his eyes and spun toward the house. That stung. I was sick of him treating me like a stupid kid.

The locks were more complicated than a Rubik’s cube, so Logan needed to reseal them. As he did, Grandma hobbled out of the lounge. I met her at the doorway, but she said, “Get your hands off me pervert.”

“Gramma it’s me. Blake.”

“I’m not an invalid. Piss off before I scream.”

It hurt when she treated me like a stranger. Growing up, I’d always looked forward to seeing her. The way she’d hug me close and cover the top of my head with fierce little kisses and insist on giving me money for sweets.

Logan and I both had a go at explaining what happened, but she only tutted and said, “That man always was a drama queen.”

She went to climb the stairs, but between her stooped spine and rickety knees, the trek took five minutes. Even with our help. Anytime we steadied her she unloaded another round of insults. She disappeared into the bedroom, and then her rough, chainsaw snore rang out.

And that was that. My brother and I were stranded there without so much as a Gameboy.

In the lounge, a CRT TV received a fuzzy picture of BBC One, so we watched twenty minutes of a cooking show where celebrities crowded around a sizzling pan. With every roll of thunder, the signal temporarily turned to black-and-white fuzz.

I kept pestering Logan to play ‘the blind game’, but he insisted he was too old until a program about renovating houses started. 

The blind game was simple: somebody put their blindfold on and looked for the other while the ‘hider’ tried sneaking up on them. Usually, I hid in a storage cupboard at the back of the kitchen *just* large enough to hold me, a vacuum cleaner, and a mop, but now I was old enough and smart enough to realize it was the first place Logan checked. So, I left the door slightly open and perched myself on the closest counter instead. When he made a b-line for the nook, I leapt onto his back.

He shrugged me off, wrestled me onto the floor, and then pinched the pressure point in my shoulder, both of us laughing. After a few rounds we’d exhausted every hiding place and returned to the TV. Our stomachs wouldn’t quit grumbling. A bacon double-cheeseburger should’ve been halfway through my digestive system by then…

As time marched on, we spoke less and less. Even though the windows were blocked, I knew it was getting dark. 7.30 became 7.45. Then 8. My teeth started chattering together.

""Quit being such a pussy,"" Logan said, although I could tell he was nervous because he kept tapping his watch non-stop.

I must’ve still looked scared because he reached over and patted me on the shoulder. “Just chill. Mom’ll get back soon. Then we’ll go for Burger King.”

As if on cue, his watch beeped. Fifteen minutes to go. Swallowing a gulp, he said, “Okay, get your blindfold on.”

He helped adjust mine so everything was perfectly black, then we sat in silence while a tennis ball got batted around on TV. I’m not sure how much time passed because I didn’t want to risk peeking at the clock above the mantlepiece.

Soon the TV cut to an emergency weather report. A lady announced several major roads were closed due to flooding. My hands balled into fists. Did that mean Mom couldn’t reach us?

From above our heads, there came a heavy thud. My neck craned towards the sound. On television a crowd applauded. Logan fumbled for the remote to switch it off, then we breathed in sharply.

“What should we do?” I whispered.

“Nothing.”

“But what if Grandma’s hurt like Grandpa was?”

“Nobody’s fucking hur—”

There was another thud, loud enough to rattle fixtures around the room.

“Wait here,” Logan sighed.

When he got up, I did too—partly because I was sick of him brushing me aside, mostly because I was terrified of being left alone. I grabbed onto his t-shirt despite his protests, and then we shuffled into the chilly, draughty hall, hands fumbling across radiators, feet stamping along the floor. On our way to the stairs, Logan tried the phone but it was dead.

The noisy steps creaked beneath our feet. Still blindfolded, we reached the upper landing, and then Logan gently pushed open the bedroom door, only a slither, but wide enough that hot air blasted me in the face, warm and moist like the inside of a greenhouse.

“Grandma?” he whispered.

A chilling scream rang out which caused us to cling onto each other, then Logan’s hands fumbled over my face, checking the blindfold hadn’t slipped.

“Sorry boys,” Grandma said, laughing. “I didn’t realize you were here. Where’s your mother?”

Her voice radiated warmth now, even though she spoke through a swollen throat close to the ceiling. It had a tender quality that helped settle your nerves, even if you’d cut your finger or seen a monster in the closet. 

An enormous sense of relief washed through me. Her ‘funny spell’ had ended. She’d become lucid again.

After we explained what happened, she said, “Hmm. Well, nothing else doing but to wait the storm out I’m afraid. Have you boys had tea yet?”

We told her we hadn’t.

“Alright then let’s get you fed and watered,” she said, as she ducked beneath the doorframe.

Logan and I felt our way into the kitchen and sat around the table while cupboards swung open and shut. Soon the aroma of beef stew filled the air.

“Bon appetit,” Grandma said, setting out two bowls. “Do you know what that means Blake?”

“Good appetite.”

“Smart lad. What do you boys say to some pavlova for dessert?”

“Yes please,” I said.

“Fuck—I mean, *hell* yeah,” Logan added.

She scolded him for his language, then said, “I’ll leave you to eat in peace. Call me when you’re ready. Remember, blindfolds stay on.”

I devoured my stew without spilling much. Was I still upset about Burger King? Sure. But a stew-pavlova two-punch combo tasted almost as good. Soon our spoons dropped into the bowls, then we sat back, our bellies full.

We shouted we were done. Then we waited. And we waited. And we waited.

The legs of Logan’s chair scraped across the floor.

“Logan?” I said, anxiously.

“Chill. I’m gonna tell her we’re ready for dessert.”

He marched off down the hall, leaving me alone. It was dead quiet in the house except for the rain, thunder, and my racing thoughts. It had, easily, been five hours since Mom left—how bad was the storm anyway? Could we have been trapped there for days?

And what about Grandpa? Would he be okay?

Part of me wanted to stay there and let Logan sort things out, but I wasn’t a kid anymore. I went after him, calling as I went.

My hands ran over the side panelling along the walls, over Grandpa’s model cars. I fumbled for door handles, calling into empty room after empty room. The house felt twice as big without Logan to guide the way.

Passing the stairs the temperature shot up. On the far side, as I nudged the door into the den open, thick stuffy air seeped out, poisoning the hall.

“Logan?” I called.

Nobody answered, but as I turned away a floorboard creaked on the far side of the room. Then a voice spoke out of the darkness, all shredded and hoarse, like scud water regurgitating through a storm drain.

“My bed’s different.”

I said, “…Grandma? Is that you?”

“What are you growing corn in those ears? *Of course* it’s me. I said the bed’s different.”

There was no bed in there—only a cabinet, a rickety chair, and a sewing machine. Sweat ran down beneath the blindfold and stung my eyes. Despite the heat, I was shivering. “Grandma…is everything okay?”

“Of course it’s okay,” she snapped.

“Do you remember who I am?” I asked and I immediately wished I didn’t—as if her not answering the question kept things from being real.

“What am I, an imbecile? You’re Blake.”

My chest unclenched. Funny spell averted. I sighed and said, “Have you seen Logan? He was looking for you.”

“Who knows what that boy’s up to. Stealing probably.”

This confused me. She scolded Logan for his language a lot, sure. But he was no thief. “Uhh, anyway, I came to say we’re ready for pavlova.”

“Fine, fine. But first take that silly thing off your head and come give me a hug.”

With every passing second, the icy silence which followed became more and more unbearable. I cleared my throat. “But Grandma it’s your golden hour. We’re not supposed to.”

“Don’t be ridiculous,” she snapped, as that cruel edge seeped back into her voice. “Take that thing off and let me see your beautiful face.”

The realization hit me like a ton of bricks: she’d lapsed into another of her episodes. Desperate, I said, “Grandma I don’t think that’s a good idea. You’re…*sick*.”

“Of course I’m sick,” she snarled. “And you know what the best medicine is? A hug from my favourite grandson.”

From behind somebody burst along and fumbled around until they grabbed me by the arm.

“FUCKING RUN,” Blake shouted. He’d sensed the danger and gone the other way around the stairs to find me.

He dragged me down the hall by the arm so fast we crashed against lamps and banged our shins against side tables, knocking model cars to the ground, breaking them into a thousand pieces. At the front door, he fumbled with the locks, but they were borderline impossible even when we could see. We were like rats trapped in a maze.

“BOYS WHERE ARE YOU GOING?” Grandma screamed in a terrified voice. “DON’T LEAVE ME!”

Heavy footsteps came stomping along. Her arms must’ve been held out wide because they scraped along both sides of the wall—a distance of more than 6 ft. Logan grabbed me again and we raced into the kitchen.

He slammed the door shut and held his weight against it. “GRAB A CHAIR.”

Throughout the ground floor doors opened and shut. “WHERE DID YOU BOYS GO? COME BACK.”

I helped get a chair wedged beneath the handle just as it jiggled. 

“BOYS WHAT’S WRONG? LET ME IN!”

The door bounced once. Twice.

“QUICK,” Logan shouted.

We held our backs against the door just as Grandma struck a third time, threatening to knock us away. She alternated between mashing her fists and crying for help. I squeezed my eyes shut beneath the blindfold and prayed for Mom to come save us.

Then, everything stopped.

As we listened, the side of the door shivered open, just a crack. I sensed a finger worming through the gap, followed by a hand. Then an entire arm.

The arm probed the space directly above our heads. I crouched low, but bony fingers crawled along the top of my skull, hotter than the stove. The hand clamped shut around my head, ripping away the blindfold and singing the hair as I dropped to the floor.

Grandma hissed raw fury, then the door bounced again. Without our combined weight holding it shut, the chair gave way. The door burst open and slammed against the inside wall, knocking Logan onto the floor beside me.

I caught a glimpse of a misshapen silhouette filling the outer hall, but at the last second shielded my eyes from the glow.

Logan picked me up.

“My blindfold,” I whimpered. In a flash, he wrestled his own over my eyes.

“HUG TIME,” the creature on the far side of the room snarled, the heat surging around us.

Logan shielded my body with his own, ready to make his last stand, but I shouted, “The compartment.”

We sprinted toward the tiny nook, me first, then Logan tried squeezing in after. I tossed the vacuum and mop away and then made myself as small as possible. He wedged himself inside and pulled the door as far as it could go. Neither of us had space to breathe but for a moment I thought we’d be safe in there.

But then two long arms invaded the space.

“COME TO GRANNNNNYYYYY.”

Logan started sliding away. I found his hands and held on with all my strength, but Grandma was too strong. My big brother, my protector, got reeled away like a fish on a line.

He screamed, but not for long, because that scream became a dry croak as his throat closed over. I wanted to help, but I couldn’t bring myself to move. So, I yanked the door shut and held my breath. Soon I couldn’t hear anything except the harsh thud of blood in my ears.

It wasn’t long before Logan’s watch beeped again, signalling the end of Grandma’s golden hour. I didn’t budge a single inch. Not even when Mom’s car pulled up outside. Or when she entered the house. Or when she found out what happened and started screaming…

**--**

A few days later, I was helping Grandpa out of the car. His head was encased in a thick bandage. I helped him over to the house while Mom unlocked the door.

In the den, Grandma was raving about invisible chickens. Logan was there too, sitting on an armchair. I asked if he wanted to play the blind man’s game but his eyes stayed locked on the new Gameboy Mom bought for him.

Mom got Grandpa settled then made lasagne which everyone ate except Grandma, who complained it tasted worse than fried dog shit. Afterwards, Logan asked if we were gonna stick around, but Mom said she needed to get me home because I had homework to finish. That wasn’t true, and I think he knew this.

The *real* reason was because it was already 8.45, which meant Logan and Grandma’s golden hour was about to [start](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)…",737,2024-11-13 14:42:56,-0.3625,2024-11-13
NoSleep,"Man, that was rough. So Logan has to stay there now? I’m sorry you lost your brother, but at least he protected you as best he could. But I’d stop going to Grandma’s if I were you.",CBenson1273,93172,"Growing up, we weren't allowed to look at Grandma during her 'Golden Hour'. I wish I never found out why.","At the front door Mom hesitated, drew a deep breath, and said, “Okay, has everybody still got their blindfolds?”

“Noooooo,” my brother Logan replied sarcastically. “I lost mine since you asked three seconds ago.”

Logan *hated* the safety lectures we got whenever we visited Grandma. He was thirteen and I was ten, both tall and stocky with a shock of blond hair.

Mom’s eyes narrowed at him. “Logan, how about you drop the attitude? Like I haven’t got enough on my plate already.”

“My blindfold’s right here,” I said, tapping my forehead before another argument broke out.

“Good boy Blake. We’ll be in and out in twenty minutes, I promise.”

“Then we’re getting Burger King right?”

“Absolutely,” she said with a bright smile. I punched the air while Logan muttered something too low to hear. A special treat like Burger King was a huge deal to me back then.

Our grandparents’ house lay in the centre of a dirt lot surrounded by a chain-link fence. All the curtains were taped shut. Mom rapped the door, then we waited there for a few minutes while rain hammered the gutters like a steel drum. I remember worrying we’d stand there until Grandma’s ‘golden hour’ started.

Mom grabbed a ring of keys from her bag and undid the series of locks, then we stepped into the musty air of the house, shaking water from our coats and jackets. All the tacky upholstered furniture was already outdated, even back then, and the walls were covered with shelves displaying Grandpa’s prized model car collection.

Usually, Logan and I stood on the welcome mat while Mom battened down the hatches, but past the stairs and to the left, smoke was pouring out from beneath the kitchen door. Mom rushed along the corridor into the kitchen, followed closely by Blake and I. The downstairs landing wrapped around the stairs, with the kitchen at the back of the house.

On the stove, a fry pan was spurting with giant flames as Grandma, completely unaware of the danger, tried to scramble some eggs. Mom yanked the pan off the grill just as an alarm started shrieking. She shouted for us to get Grandma out of there, waving away most of the smoke with a set of oven mitts.

Dressed in her pink nightgown, Grandma fought us every step of the way, swiping at the air with her long, yellow nails. I was afraid of using too much force because her frail body always made me picture a skeleton. In the lounge, she refused to settle on a plastic-covered sofa—everything was shrink-wrapped, really—until Logan promised he’d make her a corned beef sandwich if she behaved, speaking in the soft tones you’d use around a fussy toddler.

Shortly after the alarm quieted, Mom came in and said to Grandma, “Where’s Dad? He didn’t answer the door.”

“Eugh, don’t speak to me about that man. I was washing the dog but he kept climbing away.”

“Grandma and Grandpa got a dog?” I whispered to Logan.

“No dickhead. Grandma’s nuts, remember?”

“Logan,” Mom snapped. She *insisted* we refer to Grandma’s problems as her ‘funny spells’.

Once it became obvious nobody could coax any sense out of the old lady, Mom went to find Grandpa herself. We’d barely had time to sit when she screamed from a room upstairs. Logan and I exchanged a look of concern then rushed after her.

Grandpa was sprawled across the bathroom floor, groaning. A shower curtain which had been ripped off its hooks covered his midsection, and blood oozed from a deep gash along his forehead staining the tiled floor red. He’d slipped while climbing out of the tub. Him and Mom had endless arguments about that house being a death trap but he refused to move. He was afraid what might’ve happened if they moved someplace filled with nosey neighbours.

Mom shouted for me to call an ambulance. I rushed downstairs but the rotary phone in the landing spat a dead tone. I figured the storm knocked out the lines.

“It’s not working,” I said as I rushed back.

Mom pinched the bridge of her nose and sobbed while Logan and I stood there. Kids aren’t great at processing those sorts of situations. She told Logan to help her get Grandpa into a bathrobe hanging from a nearby rack.

“Ew, gross,” Logan sneered.

“NOW!” Mom’s sudden outburst upset me more than all the blood. She rarely raised her voice.

She told me to help with the doors. Grandpa must’ve noticed me shaking, because he forced a smile and said, “I tell you Blake, this getting old business ain’t for the faint-hearted.”

He spoke as if he’d just had five glasses of whiskey, all sluggish and lazy.

Logan and Mom helped him outside into the family Volvo, all four of us getting drenched.

“Alright, everybody in the car,” she said, panting heavily.

“I’m not leaving Helena,” Grandpa protested from the passenger seat. “She needs somebody to keep an eye on her.”

Mom’s hand shot up out of frustration. She took a moment to compose herself, checked her watch, and then said, “Okay, you boys stay here while I take Grandpa to hospital. Grandma’s gonna be fine for another three hours. I’ll be back before then, but keep your blindfolds close just in case. Logan, you’re in charge. Set your electric watch thingy for a quarter to nine so you don’t forget.”

“That’s okay, I’ll rememb—""

“JUST FUCKING DO IT,” she screamed as she climbed into the car, slamming the door shut behind her.

As we watched her drive off, I told myself there was no reason to freak out. We’d stayed with Grandma during her golden hour many times.

*Yeah, before her ‘funny spells’* a voice at the back of my mind added…

“Are we still getting Burger King?” I asked Logan after Mom’s Volvo disappeared. He rolled his eyes and spun toward the house. That stung. I was sick of him treating me like a stupid kid.

The locks were more complicated than a Rubik’s cube, so Logan needed to reseal them. As he did, Grandma hobbled out of the lounge. I met her at the doorway, but she said, “Get your hands off me pervert.”

“Gramma it’s me. Blake.”

“I’m not an invalid. Piss off before I scream.”

It hurt when she treated me like a stranger. Growing up, I’d always looked forward to seeing her. The way she’d hug me close and cover the top of my head with fierce little kisses and insist on giving me money for sweets.

Logan and I both had a go at explaining what happened, but she only tutted and said, “That man always was a drama queen.”

She went to climb the stairs, but between her stooped spine and rickety knees, the trek took five minutes. Even with our help. Anytime we steadied her she unloaded another round of insults. She disappeared into the bedroom, and then her rough, chainsaw snore rang out.

And that was that. My brother and I were stranded there without so much as a Gameboy.

In the lounge, a CRT TV received a fuzzy picture of BBC One, so we watched twenty minutes of a cooking show where celebrities crowded around a sizzling pan. With every roll of thunder, the signal temporarily turned to black-and-white fuzz.

I kept pestering Logan to play ‘the blind game’, but he insisted he was too old until a program about renovating houses started. 

The blind game was simple: somebody put their blindfold on and looked for the other while the ‘hider’ tried sneaking up on them. Usually, I hid in a storage cupboard at the back of the kitchen *just* large enough to hold me, a vacuum cleaner, and a mop, but now I was old enough and smart enough to realize it was the first place Logan checked. So, I left the door slightly open and perched myself on the closest counter instead. When he made a b-line for the nook, I leapt onto his back.

He shrugged me off, wrestled me onto the floor, and then pinched the pressure point in my shoulder, both of us laughing. After a few rounds we’d exhausted every hiding place and returned to the TV. Our stomachs wouldn’t quit grumbling. A bacon double-cheeseburger should’ve been halfway through my digestive system by then…

As time marched on, we spoke less and less. Even though the windows were blocked, I knew it was getting dark. 7.30 became 7.45. Then 8. My teeth started chattering together.

""Quit being such a pussy,"" Logan said, although I could tell he was nervous because he kept tapping his watch non-stop.

I must’ve still looked scared because he reached over and patted me on the shoulder. “Just chill. Mom’ll get back soon. Then we’ll go for Burger King.”

As if on cue, his watch beeped. Fifteen minutes to go. Swallowing a gulp, he said, “Okay, get your blindfold on.”

He helped adjust mine so everything was perfectly black, then we sat in silence while a tennis ball got batted around on TV. I’m not sure how much time passed because I didn’t want to risk peeking at the clock above the mantlepiece.

Soon the TV cut to an emergency weather report. A lady announced several major roads were closed due to flooding. My hands balled into fists. Did that mean Mom couldn’t reach us?

From above our heads, there came a heavy thud. My neck craned towards the sound. On television a crowd applauded. Logan fumbled for the remote to switch it off, then we breathed in sharply.

“What should we do?” I whispered.

“Nothing.”

“But what if Grandma’s hurt like Grandpa was?”

“Nobody’s fucking hur—”

There was another thud, loud enough to rattle fixtures around the room.

“Wait here,” Logan sighed.

When he got up, I did too—partly because I was sick of him brushing me aside, mostly because I was terrified of being left alone. I grabbed onto his t-shirt despite his protests, and then we shuffled into the chilly, draughty hall, hands fumbling across radiators, feet stamping along the floor. On our way to the stairs, Logan tried the phone but it was dead.

The noisy steps creaked beneath our feet. Still blindfolded, we reached the upper landing, and then Logan gently pushed open the bedroom door, only a slither, but wide enough that hot air blasted me in the face, warm and moist like the inside of a greenhouse.

“Grandma?” he whispered.

A chilling scream rang out which caused us to cling onto each other, then Logan’s hands fumbled over my face, checking the blindfold hadn’t slipped.

“Sorry boys,” Grandma said, laughing. “I didn’t realize you were here. Where’s your mother?”

Her voice radiated warmth now, even though she spoke through a swollen throat close to the ceiling. It had a tender quality that helped settle your nerves, even if you’d cut your finger or seen a monster in the closet. 

An enormous sense of relief washed through me. Her ‘funny spell’ had ended. She’d become lucid again.

After we explained what happened, she said, “Hmm. Well, nothing else doing but to wait the storm out I’m afraid. Have you boys had tea yet?”

We told her we hadn’t.

“Alright then let’s get you fed and watered,” she said, as she ducked beneath the doorframe.

Logan and I felt our way into the kitchen and sat around the table while cupboards swung open and shut. Soon the aroma of beef stew filled the air.

“Bon appetit,” Grandma said, setting out two bowls. “Do you know what that means Blake?”

“Good appetite.”

“Smart lad. What do you boys say to some pavlova for dessert?”

“Yes please,” I said.

“Fuck—I mean, *hell* yeah,” Logan added.

She scolded him for his language, then said, “I’ll leave you to eat in peace. Call me when you’re ready. Remember, blindfolds stay on.”

I devoured my stew without spilling much. Was I still upset about Burger King? Sure. But a stew-pavlova two-punch combo tasted almost as good. Soon our spoons dropped into the bowls, then we sat back, our bellies full.

We shouted we were done. Then we waited. And we waited. And we waited.

The legs of Logan’s chair scraped across the floor.

“Logan?” I said, anxiously.

“Chill. I’m gonna tell her we’re ready for dessert.”

He marched off down the hall, leaving me alone. It was dead quiet in the house except for the rain, thunder, and my racing thoughts. It had, easily, been five hours since Mom left—how bad was the storm anyway? Could we have been trapped there for days?

And what about Grandpa? Would he be okay?

Part of me wanted to stay there and let Logan sort things out, but I wasn’t a kid anymore. I went after him, calling as I went.

My hands ran over the side panelling along the walls, over Grandpa’s model cars. I fumbled for door handles, calling into empty room after empty room. The house felt twice as big without Logan to guide the way.

Passing the stairs the temperature shot up. On the far side, as I nudged the door into the den open, thick stuffy air seeped out, poisoning the hall.

“Logan?” I called.

Nobody answered, but as I turned away a floorboard creaked on the far side of the room. Then a voice spoke out of the darkness, all shredded and hoarse, like scud water regurgitating through a storm drain.

“My bed’s different.”

I said, “…Grandma? Is that you?”

“What are you growing corn in those ears? *Of course* it’s me. I said the bed’s different.”

There was no bed in there—only a cabinet, a rickety chair, and a sewing machine. Sweat ran down beneath the blindfold and stung my eyes. Despite the heat, I was shivering. “Grandma…is everything okay?”

“Of course it’s okay,” she snapped.

“Do you remember who I am?” I asked and I immediately wished I didn’t—as if her not answering the question kept things from being real.

“What am I, an imbecile? You’re Blake.”

My chest unclenched. Funny spell averted. I sighed and said, “Have you seen Logan? He was looking for you.”

“Who knows what that boy’s up to. Stealing probably.”

This confused me. She scolded Logan for his language a lot, sure. But he was no thief. “Uhh, anyway, I came to say we’re ready for pavlova.”

“Fine, fine. But first take that silly thing off your head and come give me a hug.”

With every passing second, the icy silence which followed became more and more unbearable. I cleared my throat. “But Grandma it’s your golden hour. We’re not supposed to.”

“Don’t be ridiculous,” she snapped, as that cruel edge seeped back into her voice. “Take that thing off and let me see your beautiful face.”

The realization hit me like a ton of bricks: she’d lapsed into another of her episodes. Desperate, I said, “Grandma I don’t think that’s a good idea. You’re…*sick*.”

“Of course I’m sick,” she snarled. “And you know what the best medicine is? A hug from my favourite grandson.”

From behind somebody burst along and fumbled around until they grabbed me by the arm.

“FUCKING RUN,” Blake shouted. He’d sensed the danger and gone the other way around the stairs to find me.

He dragged me down the hall by the arm so fast we crashed against lamps and banged our shins against side tables, knocking model cars to the ground, breaking them into a thousand pieces. At the front door, he fumbled with the locks, but they were borderline impossible even when we could see. We were like rats trapped in a maze.

“BOYS WHERE ARE YOU GOING?” Grandma screamed in a terrified voice. “DON’T LEAVE ME!”

Heavy footsteps came stomping along. Her arms must’ve been held out wide because they scraped along both sides of the wall—a distance of more than 6 ft. Logan grabbed me again and we raced into the kitchen.

He slammed the door shut and held his weight against it. “GRAB A CHAIR.”

Throughout the ground floor doors opened and shut. “WHERE DID YOU BOYS GO? COME BACK.”

I helped get a chair wedged beneath the handle just as it jiggled. 

“BOYS WHAT’S WRONG? LET ME IN!”

The door bounced once. Twice.

“QUICK,” Logan shouted.

It was basically the same as wanting a parcel securely delivered to your house. In the past (Flash) you were giving your house keys to the postman so they could open the door and drop the parcel in. You were relying on the postman (Flash) to not lose those keys, give them to someone else and not leave the door open.

ExplainLikeImFive,"There were a lot of reasons.

The internet had a lot of technologies to make applications. Things like Java Applets, Microsoft Silverlight, Active X, Flash... most of these basically died as the years went on.

Security vulnerabilities were one thing they all tended to suffer from. Outside of Active X, I don't think that was the main reason they all died. Active X was so bad, I think it had to die off just on security alone :P

I'd say they died for two reasons.

1. 'Standardized HTML' got good enough at doing what they did. By the time we got to HTML 5, it offered enough functionality that you didn't need these technologies, which often required a separate installation/plugins.

2. Mobile. As people moved to use mobile devices (android/iphone...) a lot these other technologies became more difficult. Some took too much resources and would slow the device down too much. Others were a pain to install on the mobile devices. Others may not have even been available in some devices. So gradually certain technologies were not commonly found on mobile devices. Websites had to look at the writing on the wall and realize their flash/applet/silverlight... based websites were not compatible with being mobile.

So they cut off my internet and are threatening me with legal action. Note, the ISP didn't cut off my internet, the building manager did, even though there was nothing in my lease agreement stating otherwise.

I've apologized and written documentation stating I won't do it again. But they are still refusing to cut my internet back on.

TrueAskReddit,">I’m not talking about unrealistic utopias, but practical, meaningful shifts.

A well regulated and taxed capitalistic society is supposed to be exactly that.  

Yes we offer compeition to find the best ways of doing things, but we take some of the rewards the winners earn and use that to soften the losses of the losers and to provide for those that can't care for themselves.

We collaborate with each other in 1000s of ways, more so than ever in the past.  There are entire global networks used to produce everything from computer programs to toys, to food to cars.  A typical car or computer has had many thousands of people work together to produce it.  It is extremely efficient.

>from economic inequality to environmental destruction — stem from this relentless drive to “win” 

The system is set up to have different teams to compete in collaborating together to find the best way of doing something. From producing potatoes to lasers, to TV shows.  If there is no reward for winning, and no loss for being less efficient, why would people push themselves aggressively to improve things instead of just coasting along?

Generally speaking, every attempt to sidestep market economies or capitalistic processes in general has quickly led to people putting most of their efforts into greedily playing those systems instead.  Trying to gain a different advantage of trying to do as little work as possible etc.  

>I’m not talking about unrealistic utopias

I wanted to call someone but had no one I could even say what I was thinking to. I wrote my parents a letter and apologized for what I was about to do. I climbed onto a chair and put the rope around my neck after filling my cats food bowl to the brim and leaving his water fountain running, knowing nobody would find me or even look for weeks. I wasn’t crying or even emotional, just numb and done. I stepped off the chair and the force on my neck was intense for about 3 seconds. Then I fell to the ground because the screws had ripped out of the ceiling. The only thing I thought in the moments after I hit the floor was that i needed longer screws to hold me. As I was getting up I had an overwhelming feeling of shame, pain, and pure sadness for what I had just tried. I called my mom who is always asleep before 9 and she picked up in the middle of the night. I fought back tears as I told her that I was having a really tough time and needed serious help.

So as someone who hates taking pills because they just seem to sever my brain, I agreed to start taking a medication and upping my therapy to 3 times a week.

I am happy that you are accomplishing your goals and made a positive impact in your life. Congratulations, and keep it up.",puremptiness,14676,Fat Acceptance Movement Made Being Fat Easier and I Regret Accepting It.,"
I want to share my journey with the Fat Acceptance (FA) and Health at Every Size (HAES) movements and how they helped me come to terms with my obesity. I’m also going to talk about why I’m now working toward losing weight, not because of societal pressure, but because I’ve realized that my health, both mental and physical, would be significantly better if I were in a healthier weight range.

For a long time, I felt like there was a battle between what I wanted to believe about my body and what I knew to be true about my health. On one hand, I’d spent years being shamed for my weight, constantly being told I wasn’t healthy enough, not attractive enough, or just plain “wrong” because of my size. But on the other hand, the messages in the Fat Acceptance and HAES movements made me feel like I was allowed to love my body and that health didn’t have to be tied to size. They made me feel like it was okay to be obese, that I could still live a full and meaningful life regardless of my weight.

However, while those movements gave me a sense of relief in terms of body positivity, they didn’t change the reality of what my obesity was doing to my health. I had convinced myself for years that being obese didn’t have to negatively impact my health, but as time passed, I couldn’t ignore the fact that I was struggling with several issues that were only getting worse.

Here are some of the health issues I faced as my weight increased:
	•	Increased Appetite: I was constantly hungry. No matter how much I ate, my appetite never seemed to be satisfied, leading to overeating and constant cravings that I couldn’t shake off.
	•	Trouble Sleeping: I developed sleep apnea and had a hard time getting a full night’s rest. It wasn’t just the snoring—it was the constant waking up in the middle of the night, struggling to breathe. I woke up feeling exhausted, even after a full night’s sleep.
	•	Depression: I struggled with feelings of isolation, guilt, and shame. Despite the body positivity movement, the weight and the toll it was taking on my mental health were undeniable. I would sometimes feel like I wasn’t really accepted, like I was kidding myself by pretending everything was fine.
	•	Joint Pain and Stiffness: The more weight I gained, the more pain I experienced, especially in my knees and back. It was getting harder to move, and simple tasks became increasingly painful.
	•	Lack of Energy and Fatigue: I felt sluggish all the time. It was hard to get out of bed in the morning, and I’d often find myself feeling drained by midday. Doing anything active felt exhausting, even just walking or climbing stairs.
	•	Alcoholism: To cope with the emotional weight of my situation (no pun intended), I found myself drinking more. It was a way to numb the discomfort, but it only exacerbated my issues with weight, sleep, and overall mental health.

After years of struggling with all of this, I realized that my health wasn’t just about my size—it was about the toll obesity was taking on my life. Yes, the Fat Acceptance and HAES movements helped me feel better about existing in a larger body, but I now see that truly caring for my body means making changes for my long-term health.

I’ve started losing weight, not because of the external pressure or judgment, but because I want to feel better mentally and physically. The benefits I’ve already experienced in just a few months have been incredible. My energy is up, I sleep better, my joint pain has lessened, and I’m feeling much more in control of my life. My mental health has improved too—there’s something about the act of taking charge of my body that’s helped me feel more empowered, confident, and hopeful.

In the end, I don’t think the Fat Acceptance or HAES movements were wrong for encouraging self-love and body acceptance. But I’ve come to realize that self-love also means taking care of yourself, and that sometimes involves making hard choices about your health. It’s not about shaming yourself or anyone else; it’s about prioritizing your well-being and being realistic about the long-term effects of obesity.

Losing weight is a deeply personal choice, and for me, it’s been a necessary step toward a healthier, more fulfilling life. I’m still learning to navigate the balance between accepting my body and taking responsibility for my health, but I feel much better now that I’m making these changes for the right reasons.",524,2024-11-13 10:03:18,0.6318181818181817,2024-11-13

I’m also going to talk about why I’m now working toward losing weight, not because of societal pressure, but because I’ve realized that my health, both mental and physical, would be significantly better if I were in a healthier weight range.

For a long time, I felt like there was a battle between what I wanted to believe about my body and what I knew to be true about my health. On one hand, I’d spent years being shamed for my weight, constantly being told I wasn’t healthy enough, not attractive enough, or just plain “wrong” because of my size. But on the other hand, the messages in the Fat Acceptance and HAES movements made me feel like I was allowed to love my body and that health didn’t have to be tied to size. They made me feel like it was okay to be obese, that I could still live a full and meaningful life regardless of my weight.

However, while those movements gave me a sense of relief in terms of body positivity, they didn’t change the reality of what my obesity was doing to my health. I had convinced myself for years that being obese didn’t have to negatively impact my health, but as time passed, I couldn’t ignore the fact that I was struggling with several issues that were only getting worse.

Here are some of the health issues I faced as my weight increased:
	•	Increased Appetite: I was constantly hungry. No matter how much I ate, my appetite never seemed to be satisfied, leading to overeating and constant cravings that I couldn’t shake off.
	•	Trouble Sleeping: I developed sleep apnea and had a hard time getting a full night’s rest. It wasn’t just the snoring—it was the constant waking up in the middle of the night, struggling to breathe. I woke up feeling exhausted, even after a full night’s sleep.
	•	Depression: I struggled with feelings of isolation, guilt, and shame. Despite the body positivity movement, the weight and the toll it was taking on my mental health were undeniable. I would sometimes feel like I wasn’t really accepted, like I was kidding myself by pretending everything was fine.
	•	Joint Pain and Stiffness: The more weight I gained, the more pain I experienced, especially in my knees and back. It was getting harder to move, and simple tasks became increasingly painful.
	•	Lack of Energy and Fatigue: I felt sluggish all the time. It was hard to get out of bed in the morning, and I’d often find myself feeling drained by midday. Doing anything active felt exhausting, even just walking or climbing stairs.
	•	Alcoholism: To cope with the emotional weight of my situation (no pun intended), I found myself drinking more. It was a way to numb the discomfort, but it only exacerbated my issues with weight, sleep, and overall mental health.

After years of struggling with all of this, I realized that my health wasn’t just about my size—it was about the toll obesity was taking on my life. Yes, the Fat Acceptance and HAES movements helped me feel better about existing in a larger body, but I now see that truly caring for my body means making changes for my long-term health.

I’ve started losing weight, not because of the external pressure or judgment, but because I want to feel better mentally and physically. The benefits I’ve already experienced in just a few months have been incredible. My energy is up, I sleep better, my joint pain has lessened, and I’m feeling much more in control of my life. My mental health has improved too—there’s something about the act of taking charge of my body that’s helped me feel more empowered, confident, and hopeful.

In the end, I don’t think the Fat Acceptance or HAES movements were wrong for encouraging self-love and body acceptance. But I’ve come to realize that self-love also means taking care of yourself, and that sometimes involves making hard choices about your health. It’s not about shaming yourself or anyone else; it’s about prioritizing your well-being and being realistic about the long-term effects of obesity.

Losing weight is a deeply personal choice, and for me, it’s been a necessary step toward a healthier, more fulfilling life. I’m still learning to navigate the balance between accepting my body and taking responsibility for my health, but I feel much better now that I’m making these changes for the right reasons.",524,2024-11-13 09:50:58,1.0,2024-11-13

Fuck yes old and boring! A lot better than the alternative!


You made it!",s-mores,707361,"UPDATE: I've [F23] been in love with my best friend [M21] since I first met him. It's not going away, and I don't know how to deal with it because I have no idea if he likes me, and it's stopping me from meeting someone else. (Now F28, M27)","Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b4ivgs/ive\_f23\_been\_in\_love\_with\_my\_best\_friend\_m21/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b4ivgs/ive_f23_been_in_love_with_my_best_friend_m21/)

So, hello. A little over five years ago I made a post on this subreddit looking for advice on how to handle my incredibly painful unrequited love for my best friend. I'd honestly forgotten about this until making a password reset on another account, and saw ""tobz13"" among my email search results. But as I read through the post, I remember how very comforting and terrifying the responses to my post was, being a more or less unanimous ""ask him out"" that scared my ass to death. Sorry that this isn't really a happy update, but... I don't know. It felt weird seeing something I wrote in what feels like a different life, and the people who responded seemed so genuinely kind and trying to help, I feel like I weirdly owe some kind of update?

Especially for that one, dear, sweet commenter whose account is now deleted. I so wish I'd have a way to reach out to them, because that was one of the most thoughtful comments I think I've ever gotten.

And just to recap, with hindsight: I really, really was in love with this man and I had been for about two years. Like, full nine yards in love. Struggling to breathe when he talked about someone else but still cheering him on because he deserved happiness-levels of in love. If that sounds a bit like obsession to you, then that's because it probably was.

The thing about unrequited love, the thing that really sucks about it, is that it's incredibly hard to move on from, but until you do move on, your brain keeps obsessing about it to the point where it can be impossible to get anything done. It had been two years of that when I made that post, two years of pining and pain and an ever-growing pile of crushed hopes, and I think I was going a little bit insane, constantly swinging between butterflies and love highs when I was with my friend and the crushing feeling of rejection every time he'd say goodbye. And the obsession over things like how long he'd look at me, how long he'd let a hug last, how fast he'd respond to my texts, things which could either make or break my entire day depending on what the answer was.

Onto the actual update, after that primer. About a month and a half or so after I made that post, still trying to hype myself up to actually ask this man out, I accidentally became a head organiser for an event at the university I was studying at for the moment. Long story short, the person managing me was Not Kind, I was extremely overworked from the event on top of writing a thesis, I was equally stressed out in my private life due to the whole situation with my best friend, and I ended up going through a pretty severe case of burnout. 

Add onto everything that I'd developed an addiction to alcohol to try to handle everything, and was also experiencing what was most likely a drug-induced paranoid psychosis, and I was a mess.

I ended up moving back in with my dad in September, and spent about a year doing nothing but sleeping, crying, playing Skyrim and going to rehab and therapy. Start of 2021, I went back to school, and slowly recovered. I've been sober since 2020, the paranoia hasn't completely gone away but it's more manageable (I used to think my landlord listened to me through a radon measurement device, and at least that's over), and I think I've got a work-life balance figured out that helps me not overwork myself or go into freetime lethargy because I've got too much time off. It was long, and painful, but I did it.

If you're wondering where my best friend was in all of this, I... Honestly don't know. I went back to look at our text messages, and from what I can see he tried to call me a few times in early September, I didn't respond, and then nothing until around Christmas when he wondered if I wanted to meet up sometime. I said yes, and then never followed through. He hasn't texted me since january 4th, 2020.

Now, to be clear, I don't blame him for not reaching out more. My non-responding is what killed that friendship. I know, because it also killed every other friendship I had at the time. I don't know, ""alcohol addiction, deep depression and crippling paranoia"" may be a fair *explanation* to one day stop responding to any of your friends, but I still deeply regret those choices. If I were to make a relationships post today, it would be on how the fuck you word an apology after behaviour like that, five years down the road.

Sorry. I feel like this is starting to become a journal. I'm gonna stop my reflections there. So, about my 'love' for my best friend, with some years of hindsight and therapy behind me:

I don't think I was in love with him. I think I was in love with the idea of him, and I think I was obsessed for sure, but looking back... I don't know. I genuinely don't know. I think a part of me really liked the fact that this was a person who so clearly wasn't interested in me (genuinely, if he was, that would *shock me* to find out, because he spent two and a half years ignoring the in hindsight VERY OBVIOUS attempts I made to deepen the relationship. Some examples include:

* him saying he's waiting for the right person, me responding ""sometimes I feel like I already have. Do you ever feel like that?"" and him going ""nah, I don't think so""
* me following that up with ""maybe you just don't know, the heart is weird sometimes"" and him going ""i'm pretty sure i'd know.""
* one time we talked about why people fall in love, and I genuinely tried to convince him a deep friendship was all you needed, while he insisted that there needed to be a level of sexual attraction as well.
* I tried to get him to do that ""36 questions that will make you fall in love"" thing with me.
* I kept trying to find excuses to hold his hand (rest in peace, my palm reading career, you were nothing but a thinly veiled attempt at finger touching) and him resolutely never going along with it
* Ditto, but with hugs, arm touching, and sitting just a little too close whenever we went out so I could ""hear him better"", which he normally responded to by going ""we should go outside so you can hear better if it's too loud in here"". Very thoughtful, but very much not what the goal was.
* one night, when we were alone in my apartment after a club event, after a particularly long shared Look, I asked him what he was thinking about in that kind of ""i don't want to break the illusion"" soft voice you put on when you're really fucking close to someone you like, and his response was ""I don't know if I agree that Geertz's metaphor about blinking makes that much sense, actually"".
* (For context, we'd bickered about that earlier in the night, since we'd just read some article about it in class. I did not expect it to make a comeback at that point.)
* Another night, when we were out together and there had been a lot of Looks and closely-leaned-in laughing together, and he pulls me to one side by the hand to talk to me about something, heart racing, only to ask me if I know if one of my friends is single because he thinks she's really fucking cute and might have been looking at him all night)

Looking back, at least some of this stuff is sort of funny.  I have no idea if he knew, or knows now, that I was in love with him. I wouldn't be surprised if some of my old friends eventually told him, but of course he's never reached out about it.

But yes, I think I kinda liked the security of this person who clearly didn't like me back. Not that I was doing well with the heartache, but there's a certain kind of fucked-up comfort that comes from pining for someone who doesn't want you back. Like, the highs I'd get when I got something that felt like 'confirmation' made up for the lows of crying in my apartment stairway when I got home after a 'denial'.

Today, I mostly just feel so bad for him and ashamed of myself. Regardless of whether he knew or not, and I'm trying to cling to the fact that he seemed to at least continue wanting to be friends as some indicator that he never felt creeped out or uncomfortable, my behaviour was pretty fucking creepy. And in the end, once I did get that distance between us, the feelings went away after some six months or so. My therapist recommended not meeting this person again, for my own sake, and by early 2020 I wasn't so painfully in love anymore.

A while later I'd end up meeting a guy I clicked with just as much, who actually liked me back and showed it. We've been together for almost three years now, and are talking about starting to try for kids at some point soon. He'd like us to get married first, but is also insisting he wants to be the one to propose so I'm just walking around waiting for the day. Even if it's not a huge surprise or secret, he just wants to get that moment of going down on one knee, and who am I to deny him.

I'm slowly growing old and boring. I'm sober, I go to my boring, stable, middle career 9-5 job, I save for my retirement and travelling on the summers, I help my dad out on his farm, I crochet little animals for my newborn niece. I come home to a man who plays his silly videogames, I play my silly videogames, we go for walks and to the museum and bicker about whether to get fat on takeout or not. I have some regrets about how my early 20s ended up playing out, but by god, I wouldn't want to go back.

# TL;DR

I didn't ask him out. Instead, I had a severe mental health crisis, stopped talking to all my friends, got sober, crawled my way back, and now looking back I'm surprisingly happy with how life turned out.

I feel like she considers every mistake I make an attack to her or to our relationship - i.e., “you don’t love me anymore”, “you don’t think about me”, etc. Maybe that’s why when she’s angry, everything turns into a huge fight.

When she’s angry, my girlfriend becomes sarcastic, spiteful and I feel scared (not physically, but I guess emotionally). Are relationships like this and I’m just immature not to know how to handle her anger?

Sorry if I worded this too poorly. English is not my first language.

relationships,You should both go to therapy. Either by yourself or as a couple,SignalAssistant2965,764,Am I (27M) just immature not knowing how to handle the situation when my girlfriend (25F) of 5 years is extremely angry?,"We’ve been together for 5 years. I feel like when she gets upset, she drags the argument to the point that simple misunderstanding and mistakes becomes a huge fight. She would tell me to leave but get upset whether I stay or try to give her space. During an argument, she becomes extremely critical, spiteful, sarcastic and would ask questions to prove her point. It’s too inquisitive. I would honestly answer her questions, but when she’s angry she’s never satisfied of my answers.

I feel like she considers every mistake I make an attack to her or to our relationship - i.e., “you don’t love me anymore”, “you don’t think about me”, etc. Maybe that’s why when she’s angry, everything turns into a huge fight.

Because of her state during anger, I am scared of her when she’s angry. I constantly try my best to accommodate her to the point of being scared to tell her of things that upset me, because she would be angry and I would not know what to do. Sometimes, I feel like I’m walking on eggshells.

By nature, I’m a non confrontational person. I also would explain to her when she’s not angry that we should try to be less emotional during arguments, which she agreed. But I’m not sure if she’s even trying.

At this point, I’m not sure if I’m just an immature guy who can’t handle anger.

ShortScaryStories,Kudos on the thalidomide reference. That’s some dark stuff.,echochilde,96794,My best friend told me she was having a baby. It wasn’t good news.,"I almost couldn’t believe it. Monica was finally expecting a child. 

I should have been happy for her.

Instead, as she rattled off trendy baby names and plans for her dream nursery, I had to bite my tongue.

Monica and I had been best friends for years, ever since we met at grief counseling. My husband had left me after five fruitless years of trying for a baby. She’d lost her fiancé in a motorcycle accident, and miscarried from the stress. The doctors had warned her against trying again. We found common ground in our pain. Two would-be mothers, bonded by children who were never meant to be. 

But that was before Fertilex.

Fertilex Inc. revolutionized family planning. Their fertility clinics guaranteed delivery of a healthy baby, even for women told they could never conceive, with no risk. When news of their success spread across the country, it seemed like a dream come true. There was only one problem.

They catered to the rich.

A Fertilex treatment cost more than I earned in a year. When Monica told me over coffee that she’d made an appointment, I was sure she was joking.

“How?” I chuckled incredulously. “Did you win the lottery?” 

She just smiled and flashed her engagement ring, a gleaming rock the size of an almond.

“My new man. I don’t want to brag, but he’s *loaded*.” She sipped her latte. “And he wants this little miracle as much as I do.” 

We hugged. We laughed. She’d finally done it.  

I cried myself to sleep that night.

Things only got worse as the weeks wore on. Monica was at my apartment every day, always bubbling about her perfect life. While I was stuck working doubles, she got to quit her job. While she shopped for designer cribs, I silently wept for a child I’d never have. Things came to a head one evening as she gushed about Fertilex over a glass of wine. “Maybe one day,” she said, with a smug squeeze of my hand, “they’ll offer services for *less fortunate women*.”  I couldn’t even look at her. The one person who could understand the pain I felt now threw her joy in my face, joy she didn’t deserve.

Maybe if she’d cared about my life, she’d have asked about my new job.

I pushed a mop through the laboratory of the local Fertilex clinic. The security cameras were always turned off during the night shift. I passed bank upon bank of hissing machinery, scouring each one until I finally found it. 

Monica’s baby — gestational age 11 weeks. Vitals were stable and strong. It wriggled, asleep in its plastic womb. 

As I slotted a syringe into the nutrient reserve tank, I told myself that she asked for this. I sank the plunger, injecting Monica’s miracle with a cocktail of whisky and thalidomide. 

In a few months, Monica’s joy would turn to ash in her mouth. Maybe then she’d finally remember what brought us together in the first place. 

Grief.

ShortScaryStories,Poor little guy! He was just trying to protect himself,pavedroadtohell,525,My son got called into the principal's office. What he did made me sick to my stomach.,"When I got to the principal’s office, he gingerly placed a small sandwich bag onto his desk. Inside was half a dozen bloody teeth.



“Miss Boyd, Marcus went around at recess hunting down anybody with a loose tooth. He ripped these all out and stole them for himself.”



“I am so sorry,” I said, “he’s never done anything like this before.”



“It’d be best if Marcus went home for the day.”



“Yes, of course, I’ll take him right now.”



I got up to leave, but the principal stopped me.



“Would you mind taking the teeth with you,” he said, “if I look at them any longer I’m gonna hurl.”



“Sure,” I said,



The drive home was silent. I wanted to yell at Marcus, but at the same time I knew this was partially my fault.



Yesterday Marcus lost his final baby tooth, but I didn’t have any change for the “tooth fairy.” All I had in my purse was a twenty, so I thought, *What the hell!* It’s his final tooth, so why not give him the twenty.



The money must have gone to his head. He had taken enough teeth at school to get over a hundred dollars.



“Marcus,” I said, “you’re old enough now that I think you should know there’s no such thing as the tooth fairy.”



“Yes there is,” Marcus said, scowling.



“No, baby, Mommy’s the one who puts money under your pillow at night.”



“I saw her.”



“What?” He was fast asleep when I put the money under his pillow.



“She made me get her more teeth. She said she’d hurt me if I didn’t.”



“Marcus, this isn’t funny. The tooth fairy isn’t real, and what you did at school was cruel. Go to your room and think about what you did.”



“Fine,” Marcus cried, and ran out of the car.



I went inside and realized I still had the bag of teeth in my pocket. I threw it away in the kitchen and got on with my day.



That night I had a terrible nightmare.



I was lying down in bed when someone small opened the door. At first I thought it was Marcus, but then I saw their face. White and angular, with an impossibly large smile that went ear to ear. She wore a white dress, had white hair, and white eyes with no pupils.



I wanted to get up, but I was paralyzed. She jumped onto the bed and crawled onto my chest.



She opened my mouth, reached in, and grabbed one of my teeth, then pulled!



I woke up screaming. I put my fingers in my mouth, but thankfully my teeth were all there.



*That was fucked up*.



I went downstairs to make myself a cup of tea and shake off the nightmare.



When I threw the tea bag into the trash I heard something.



A *clinking* that could only be one thing.



I looked in the trash, and there in the sandwich bag was half a dozen bloody coins.",1115,2024-11-13 09:31:30,-0.3171875,2024-11-13

ShortScaryStories,Nice one. I loved how you tied it all together at the end.,empreur,23747,"I’ve always been the outsider of the village, ever since what happened. ","Growing up where I grew up, I was always the outsider. 

I never got on with the other children in the village. The children that have now grown up to be the policemen. The shopkeepers. The butchers. The village itself. 

We’re a - they’re a - small community in rural Scotland. Barely 400 people. 800 eyes looking at me every time I’d go to town for food. 

My mother hasn’t been able to go for some years now. Her health becoming so bad she can hardly walk.

Bless her. 

My father was the one who causes this. He was an ‘adulterer’. He was once the husband of Victoria McIntyre, son of Donald McIntyre - the ‘royals’ of our small community. He impregnated one of the village ‘whores’, my mother, and caused Victoria to kill herself. My father fled, leaving myself and my mother to become the victims of their anger. 

Scowled at. 

Spat at. 

Shouted at. 

Punched. 

Kicked. 

Tripped. 

Hospitalised. 

We couldn’t leave as no one would buy our house. Money was tight. This is all we knew. Hours away from the nearest city and miles from the nearest other town. 

The only work I could get was on the gas line that runs through the village. An old dangerous thing that could blow at any moment. It’s filthy work and it’s a one man job. That’s why I got it I suppose. 

That’s when I got the call from my mother. She felt terrible. She needed medical assistance. I’d raced to tell the village doctor, who said so dismissively:

“Here’s some sleepy pills. Tell her to take a few and she’ll be fine.”

I ran to the local fire service, I’m sure they’d know CPR. Mike McClaughlin laughed as he sipped his tea. 

“Ha! Our fire engines out of order. Not that we’d waste fuel going to your cursed little place anyway.”

I flagged down a local policeman. 

“Huh. Who was there for Victoria McIntyre when she died? That’s what I thought.”

By the time I returned home she’d passed. Her cold body, dead on the floor. 

I returned to the village only hours later. Just after I’d buried her, finishing my work on the gas line. I remember my mother always warning my teachers and classmates when I was at school. She’d come in to pick me up after I’d been beaten senseless again by the other children, and say with tears streaming down her face:

“You know, the child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth.”

I chuckled as I remember this. As I lit the fuse that would ignite the gas line. As I thought about the sleeping pill Doctor Graham had given me that I’d slipped into Fireman Mclaughlin’s tea. As the explosion rung out. As the screams of the villagers burning alive, with no one coming to their aid, soothed my ears like a breath of fresh air.

ShortScaryStories,Well done,Electrical_Bar7954,29334,"I’ve always been the outsider of the village, ever since what happened. ","Growing up where I grew up, I was always the outsider. 

I never got on with the other children in the village. The children that have now grown up to be the policemen. The shopkeepers. The butchers. The village itself. 

We’re a - they’re a - small community in rural Scotland. Barely 400 people. 800 eyes looking at me every time I’d go to town for food. 

My mother hasn’t been able to go for some years now. Her health becoming so bad she can hardly walk.

Bless her. 

My father was the one who causes this. He was an ‘adulterer’. He was once the husband of Victoria McIntyre, son of Donald McIntyre - the ‘royals’ of our small community. He impregnated one of the village ‘whores’, my mother, and caused Victoria to kill herself. My father fled, leaving myself and my mother to become the victims of their anger. 

Scowled at. 

Spat at. 

Shouted at. 

Punched. 

Kicked. 

Tripped. 

Hospitalised. 

We couldn’t leave as no one would buy our house. Money was tight. This is all we knew. Hours away from the nearest city and miles from the nearest other town. 

The only work I could get was on the gas line that runs through the village. An old dangerous thing that could blow at any moment. It’s filthy work and it’s a one man job. That’s why I got it I suppose. 

That’s when I got the call from my mother. She felt terrible. She needed medical assistance. I’d raced to tell the village doctor, who said so dismissively:

“Here’s some sleepy pills. Tell her to take a few and she’ll be fine.”

I ran to the local fire service, I’m sure they’d know CPR. Mike McClaughlin laughed as he sipped his tea. 

“Ha! Our fire engines out of order. Not that we’d waste fuel going to your cursed little place anyway.”

I flagged down a local policeman.

ProRevenge,"Well played, especially managing to keep a straight face when he asked you about turning the water off",MrTempleDene,15155,"Neighbor was stealing water from my supply, so I ruined him.","I live in Asia, and just purchased a new house. Now, the previous owners were family friends who needed cash urgently and haven't been living in my country for nearly 3 years. So I got it for a great price in the middle of the capital city.

The sale was finalized at the start of this month and I moved in right after. The house was definitely a fixer upper, as the previous owners had left mid renovation and the main door was locked with just a padlock, not even a door lock. 

The house had no gate, meaning anyone could just walk right on in. The first day I moved in, someone's bike was parked in the garage. I just parked it on the road on the same day I had a gate installed. An angry man was knocking on my gate later and I didn't bother answering, but through my window I could see him giving up and taking the bike after 15 minutes. 

So already, I wasn't digging the neighborhood. But I didn't have any incidents after that, aside from people not knowing that this was no longer an abandoned house, so my gate was blocked more often than never but a ""No Parking"" sign on my gate fixed that issue. 

Last week, I was having a shower in my bathroom and I noticed my water pressure was lower than usual. I also heard my next door neighbors water pump going. Now this neighbor, an old guy, lived in a 3 storied house, the first being the lowest and the one he lived in. The other two floors were rented out to tenants. 

This guy wasn't happy about the house being sold, and voiced many concerns to my friends the previous owners. He was super angry about it, and my friends did warn me but I'm a 6ft guy with 3 dogs. No way he was doing anything and yep, he didn't. 

So with this living situation, a water pump is needed to pump water to the tanks on the roof, since the public supply's pressure is not enough to get it up 3 stories. 

Now, I heard the water pump going and immediately was suspicious. Sure, coincidences exist, but it wouldn't hurt to check it out. I waited till his pump turned off, and then turned on different taps in the house. Sure enough, the pressure was back to normal. 

This made me even more suspicious, but if he was stealing water, it also made sense. The water bills had been going up over the years this house wasn't lived in, but the house also had some water leaks. So it was chalked up to that, even if the bills were too high to be caused just by leaks. Now it's starting to make sense. 

At some point in the last 3 years, this old miser thought he'd save the cost of paying for water, and waltzed into the property and is siphoning water from my lines. I couldn't find where exactly he was siphoning water from, but after checking my pressure multiple times, I was pretty sure.

So I sat on it for a few days, thinking if I should confront him, go the legal path or just let it be. Now, water in my country is very cheap. My total bill, even with washing 3 animals, a car every week and watering my garden only cost like $5 per month, even with the neighbor also stealing some of it. 

But it wasn't about how much I was paying or who was paying for it. It's about entitled old people who think that they're deserving of using other people's resources without paying for it, and then getting away with it. It didn't sit right with me, and I really wanted to teach him a lesson. 

What I did was really simple. I just turned off my water from the mains. I wouldn't have to break into his property, nor would I be breaking any laws. It was the best way of getting back at him without needing to even lift a muscle. 

So on Monday, just 4 days ago, I waited till the pump flicked on, and turned off the supply. Now, the way household tanks work in my country, is that there's a ball valve in the tank which detects the level of water and turns on the pump. If the level doesn't increase, the valve stays open which electronically sends a signal to the pump to stay on until the level gets to a point at which the valve closes and also shuts off the pump. 

However, the level wasn't increasing and anyone knows that starving a pump of water isn't a good idea. This way, my expectation was that I'd burn out his pump and cause issues with his tenants. 

What I didn't account for is that his pump running constantly would mess up the fuses by constantly drawing power overnight and absolutely destroy his wiring. If he decided to upgrade his household wiring to a more modern standard, this would've been prevented. This house clearly still had 90s era wiring. 

At around 3AM, I heard all residents in the house waking up and talking in hushed voices about why just their house in the neighborhood doesn't have power or water. I found out about the power part, because the tenants devolved into shouting at their landlord. 

Our tenant protection laws are very important, and power and water are classed as essential even on a state level. Cutting those services are grounds for lawsuits, unless due to weather or some other unavoidable reason. 

In this case, the landlord is responsible for keeping the house wiring up to date and in good condition, alongside the supply of water. So the tenants were not happy and one of them immediately moved out two days later when it was informed that water and power will not be returning the very same day this happened. 

Both tenants in the two floors lodged a complaint with the police, and if a person is in clear breach of laws, the police have the authority to fine or penalize the person without a court judgment. It can be challenged in court if the person thinks that they were unfairly penalized, but they still have to pay the fines and will only be refunded if and when the court finds the fines unlawful.

So now, the landlord lost both tenants and has to pay a fine of $500, which is a lot of money in our country. He also has to refund the security deposits of both tenants, and cannot rent out until both issues are fixed, which will cost him more money. 

As of right now, he's moving out on Sunday to his daughter's place since he cannot afford to live alone. The tenants were his only source of income, and he's a retired mechanic, so he has no other income. 

He did find out why the motor kept drawing power, overloaded the wiring and burned out. He came by to my gate and asked me if I turned off my water, and I said ""oh yeah, my tank had a new leak on a pipe and I turned it off till the next day until the plumber came by to fix the issue"".

Y'all, the look on his face. He kept a straight one, but I just knew he was holding back. He just said ""oh okay"" and went back inside. Not sure if he knows I know, but I don't care because he can't do anything. 

I'm getting a plumber down next week to correct my plumbing and remove any pipes that leave my property. So I got rid of my water issue and a neighbor who could potentially be a pain in the ass, by simply flicking a tap off. Two birds one stone I'd say. 

TLDR: Bought an abandoned house, neighbor was siphoning water from my supply. Turned off my water supply when the motor was running, motor burned out the wiring in the house and cut off water and power to him and his tenants. Tenants lodged police complaints and the landlord got fined, is now destitute and forced to move in with his daughter.",12445,2024-11-07 16:27:12,0.1,2024-11-07

I disclosed this to a friend and they directed me here. ThrowAway for obvious reasons, it's a long read but the setup and backstory are important.

7 years ago I was lucky enough to be able to buy my own place, I had saved for 10 years, worked my ass off, and I was so happy to be able to have a place to call my own.

Now, being a single person on the mortgage meant I had to make compromises, one such compromise was buying a property on a shared block (a lot cheaper). Where I'm from this usually means it's on a ""strata"" title. For some that's a bonus as it means there's a communal fund for repairs, typically insurance is cheaper as it's collective, and other things like maintenance being taken care of. Strata titles also come with a lot of by-laws and restrictions on what you can and can't do. I'm a pretty private and introverted person so having to deal with people and have limits on how I live was a no-no.

I took my time, found the perfect property. Shared block but freehold title. Only thing that was I needed to pay public liability insurance for the shared walkway on the property (split equally between owners). The real estate agent is local to my area, there's also about 3-degrees of separation between us, he has friends who are friends with my friends type of thing, didn't know him, but knew of him, so that sorta felt good too.

About 5 months after I move in I get a knock on the door from the owner (landlord) of the property next to me to discuss insurance. Not a problem, I ask for a copy of the policy so I have a record. It gets sent through and low and behold it's for strata insurance. I was incredibly confused and after much back and forth the property isn't a free hold title but a strata title. I called my lawyer who conveyed the title etc. He was dumbfounded but over it all did the right thing and made things as right as they could.

I arranged for a meeting with the real estate agent. I brought emails and printouts of the adds they had all saying it was free hold, emails between the real estate agent and my lawyer discussing it's freehold status, despite it being in absolute black and white he refused to accept any fault or offer anything to make things right. I don't begrudge that, he's looking out for himself, I get that. However I wouldn't forget it.

I did enter into mediation with the real estate agent and all I asked for was, when the time came for me to sell, they'd do it or cover the costs. I thought this was reasonable, but they flat out refused offered me 1k to go away, which I refused. I had the option to pursue them legally (and was advised by the mediator to do so) but ultimately I decided against it for a few reasons, the main one being my health at the time.

So I planned and plotted, and I schemed and connived as to how to get back at this son-of-a-bitch. And I settled on this.

I found his personal facebook page which wasn't set to private, saw some photos of a ""Boys on Tour"" trip he went on a few weeks prior (so about 5-6 months after I bought the property). I also found his address through a business registration search. On the anniversary of the sale, for 6 years straight, I sent them flowers with a note :-

""Dear Real Estate Agent  
Remembering you, on this, our special day.  
She has your eyes.  
Love Elle""

They varied ever so slightly over the years but always had ""on this our special day"" and some weird inference to a love child and a desire to reconnect.

I also from time to time arranged for postcards and letters to be sent from another country, the one he was ""On Tour"" in, always signed ""Love Elle"".

I learned about 3 weeks ago that this guy had recently divorced, lost his home and is not longer working as a real estate agent. His wife had found out he cheated on her. The story I was told (through said friends of friends) went along the lines of ""He would get weird gifts and flowers every year, same day, every year. She (his wife) finally put two and two together and realised what the date was and he admitted to cheating on her"".

Now, I didn't mean for this, but it turns out a year before I bought my house he had gone on holiday, came back with an STD, gave it to his wife but somehow convinced her that it wasn't him. As such ""our special day"" turned out to be right around the time he'd have been balls deep, sans condom, in someone who wasn't his wife, only one year earlier. 

He's apparently lost his house, half his retirement savings and also his business. I do feel a little bit guilty about all of it sometimes, but then I'm reminded that he's a scumbag and that Karma, like me, is a patient, spiteful and vengeful bitch.",2380,2024-08-21 07:00:34,0.1450689935064935,2024-08-21
ProRevenge,Dude that is some awesome revenge. Fuck that guy!,GuntherTheMonk,1838,Oh I played the long game,"I am by no means an expert, or pro, at revenge but I am a patient person. I disclosed this to a friend and they directed me here. ThrowAway for obvious reasons, it's a long read but the setup and backstory are important.

7 years ago I was lucky enough to be able to buy my own place, I had saved for 10 years, worked my ass off, and I was so happy to be able to have a place to call my own.

Now, being a single person on the mortgage meant I had to make compromises, one such compromise was buying a property on a shared block (a lot cheaper). Where I'm from this usually means it's on a ""strata"" title. For some that's a bonus as it means there's a communal fund for repairs, typically insurance is cheaper as it's collective, and other things like maintenance being taken care of. Strata titles also come with a lot of by-laws and restrictions on what you can and can't do. I'm a pretty private and introverted person so having to deal with people and have limits on how I live was a no-no.

NuclearRevenge,This is the updated version. The old one was no longer usable.,claycam6,49751,About r/NuclearRevenge,"Welcome to Nuclear Revenge! Here, users will share personal extreme revenge stories that exceed the mild intent of most revenge, often in a ridiculous and even nefarious manner that will surely end badly for someone.

If you are wondering about the name of this subreddit. Nuclear Revenge is simply metaphorical. Resorting to the use of nuclear weapons would be a pretty extreme form of retaliation. And we are looking for some serious retaliation stories.

**Notice:**

1. This subreddit is not for those who are easily offended. If you feel the need to be rude to another user over the content in their story, please leave.
2. Do not ask to be a mod. We will make an announcement if we are looking for a new mod.
3. Moderators may still remove a post or a comment at their own discretion even if it does not directly violate any of our listed rules. Be mindful of what you say and do in this subreddit.
4. It's understandable if you're unsure of whether or not a story is suitable for this subreddit. If so, feel free to message the mods and we will help you determine if the story is suitable or not.

**Important Information:**

* Stories of getting revenge on a school bully violate Rule 2 and do not belong here. Do not post them.
* Acronyms for names are no longer allowed (Rule 7). See this [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/NuclearRevenge/comments/jlmmai/rule_7_no_name_acronyms/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=share) for more information.

This is a reminder to remain respectful when leaving comments or sending messages to other users or our mod team.

Recently, we had to lock a few posts due to a lot of misbehavior in the comments. Eventually, we decided to unlock them after clearing up the comments. Do not make us regret this decision.

While I’m at it, I might as well provide some criteria for leaving comments in general. 

**So, what kind of comments are allowable?**

• Compliments
• Questions
• Respectful Criticism/Observations (this helps us review posts)

**Now, what kind of comments are not allowable?**

• Insults
• Rude Criticism
• Wasteful/Low Effort Comments (that don’t contribute whatsoever)

**What about miscellaneous comments that are unrelated to the post?**

• We will decide to approve or remove these kind of comments at our own discretion. But most of the time, it should be fine. 

As a side note: In most cases, bad comments are simply removed with no further action. But in some cases, users may also be banned. 

FYI: In case of ban bypassing, we do observe posts and comments made by new accounts. This is an alternative to restricting the new accounts entirely.

If you have questions regarding any of this then feel free to ask.

I have his phone number, his moms number, and his girlfriends number. I know his address, his birthday, the schools he went to, even his favorite foods and music.

After I took every single online account he had ever had away from him, I sent a nasty email to his ISP in an effort to extort yet more information from them.

The hacker dispeared immediatly after that. I have looked for him at times over the last fifteen years since and he has not resurfaced.

4. No revenge submissions - No ""How to get even"" at all, not in submissions, not in comments.

5. No threadjacking or comment qualifiers - Stay focused on OP's problem. If you disagree with someone else's advice, offer some advice of your own with a top level comment instead of debating. If you agree with someone's advice and have nothing to add, just upvote it.

6. No misogyny, misandry, racism, religious intolerance, or similar - Respect one another, even those you disagree with. We're all equal here.

","I’m almost 30 and started working early. At 15, I joined my dad's tobacconist business, but by 23, it closed, and I found myself in the restaurant and fast food industry until 27. Then, I became an office clerk in property management, where I've worked for three years. However, my salary of €1,200 a month is not enough to live independently, buy a house, or start a family. In Italy, supporting a medium-low lifestyle requires at least €2,500-€3,000 monthly. Even with extra hours, I’d only earn €1,800.

I need to make a decision since I can’t stay in this position if I want to achieve my goals. My main aim is to balance work and personal life. I’m considering entrepreneurship but worry about being available 24/7 compared to a regular job where I can disconnect after shifts.

Here are some paths I’m contemplating:

1. Stay in my current field: Become a certified condominium administrator, aiming for €50k annually with flexible hours (3 hours daily and 2 meetings weekly).

2.Change sectors: Work as a restaurant manager (I have a contact) for €35k annually (6 hours daily, 6 days a week), but with 24/7 availability except at night.

3. Open a tattoo studio: Since I'm good at drawing, I could start this venture with an initial income of €35k annually, working 4 hours daily without availability issues.

4. Other options?

TrueUnpopularOpinion,"My thoughts.

1. I appreciate the mods efforts - I know it isn't easy to run a sub like this where you're getting pressure from the users on one side and Reddit on the other.

2. Reddit's policy as listed above, is obviously racist and sexist, based on its protected vs unprotected classes.  The same racist statement that will get you censored or banned becomes just fine and will probably be upvoted once you redirect it at white people.

3. Aside from sexism and racism, it is just bad all around.  In 1901, WEB Dubois, the first black Harvard PhD, earned in sociology, wrote a book called the Philadelphia Negro, in which he talked about the challenges facing the black community.  Not just this book, but any detailed discussion of its points would be banned on Reddit.

 For a more recent example, in  2008 as a Presidential candidate, Obama gave a father's day speech supported by statistics in which he specifically told black fathers that they needed to do more to improve the outcomes of their (black) children.  I believe this speech, or any detailed discussion of it, would be banned as well.

4. Having ""protected"" and ""unprotected"" classes will absolutely be abused and in fact I know it is already been abused by trans activists.  You should be on the lookout for people posting false and even sexist and racist arguments that, if you refute it, will get you banned.

 Trans example:  Someone says that trans children should be given puberty blockers.  Well, what exactly is a trans child?  You can't have that discussion, because it will invariably involve trying to figure out who is trans and who isn't.  (Even if you're a pediatrician, or it's your own child.)

 Race example:  Someone says white people are responsible for most hate crimes against asians.    Based on Reddits policies, virtually anything you do to try to refute this point will get you banned.

5. Complaining on reddit may be easy and might feel good but in the end it doesn't do much.  Contact your state attorney general, which is likely an elected position, and ask them if it is acceptable for a company to have a set of rules that protects certain sexes and races and not others to operate in their state.  For extra points, do it publicly, and let the opposing party know what you are doing, and they can use it in their election campaigns.",IanArcad,111553,IMPORTANT: We Need To Talk About The Content Policy...,"The Reddit Admins have messaged us and have brought it to our attention that several posts in violation of the Content Policy had been either gone unnoticed or were allowed to remain.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,It’s so ironic. These comments are full of people proving OPs point. Bashing white dudes has gotten us nowhere. It helps no one. It makes things worse for women. It creates more incels. Creates more violence against women. It makes more men republicans. But it makes people feel edgy and badass so it won’t stop. People will just keep saying dumb misandrist shit and misogynists will do the same. This shit is so idiotic and childish.,g00dGr1ef,38946,"The left have actively been treating men like garbage for the last 8+ years, and no amount of gaslighting will change that.","Just about every time a new ""resistance"" style movement comes out, it seems like men are at the forefront of taking the abuse. Not only does social media allow it, but the media practically ignores it. We are blamed for nearly every bad thing that happens, and that becomes even worse if the man happens to also be white, and lord forbid ""str8"". This isn't even including if these people are those of faith or not. By nature, we are made out to be monsters, when all we want to do is live our life.

We have our own struggles that are exclusive to us, just as women do. Only difference is when our struggles are brought up in conversation, they get shut down and downplayed almost immediately. I'm all for supporting women and seeing they get all the support they need, but when it comes to getting the support and care I need as a man, we're met with ridicule. Misandry is publicly acceptable on just about every platform, because if many of these types of comments were made about women, they'd be shut down quickly.

No matter what shxt we are put through, we are told constantly that we are ""privileged"", yet when we bring up all the privilege women have, we are laughed out of the room essentially and are told that ""if you're privileged, equality feels like oppression"" or some BS. If we bring up the fact that men have zero legal right to genital integrity at birth here, we are mocked for it. We are told to support every cause for women, and even when we support their causes, our rights and causes are belittled and ignored. When women physically, sexually, verbally, and/or emotionally abuse us, it gets downplayed ""because men do it more"". That's what it always comes back to. They'll be the first ones to say that certain crime stats ""aren't valid due to overpolicing"", but when you suggest that men are overpoliced, they'll disagree and continue clutching to their pearls that we're always the problem.

While the subject has been beaten like a horse already, the majority of them refuse to admit that the Man vs Bear debate wasn't blatantly offensive. They're allowed to use anecdotal experience as reasoning for labeling an entire group of people as dangerous, but if we do the same to them, it's called ""misogyny"". If we do it to any group of people besides men, it's suddenly not okay. But men are the targets? A-OK. We have to be okay as being labeled dangerous monsters by default, and if we don't, then it's ""men telling on themselves"". It's like telling a certain darker group of people that ""if you don't break the law, then you have nothing to worry about"". That debate was nothing more than a misandrist attack on men as a whole, and it took the world by storm and got the majority of women to agree with it.

As for the women who value our rights and causes who don't mock or invalidate us, they're labeled as a ""pick-me"" by all the others, and are cast out. What's most insulting of all, is if you tell people this is what's been happening, they'll simply tell you that it's ""not true"" and that all of this behavior simply ""didn't happen"". Yet they are still completely baffled and shocked by the election results and chalk men not voting blue to nothing more than misogyny. The complete refusal of any accountability.

\---Aaaaaand just like clockwork, several come here to downplay men's issues and tell me that ""none of this is happening"". These people are literally proving my entire point.",419,2024-11-13 18:16:00,-0.020833333333333336,2024-11-13
TrueUnpopularOpinion,"I gotta say, I've seen this all over the internet. You are right about that. 

But in real life? Barely anything. I think if people are terminally online, they think this is a bigger issue than it really is. I am a white dude, the amount of times I have felt oppressed in the real world is exactly 0.

You are completely right that this type of talk has pushed young men farther right, democrats need to learn from this mistake.",OvSec2901,22032,"The left have actively been treating men like garbage for the last 8+ years, and no amount of gaslighting will change that.","Just about every time a new ""resistance"" style movement comes out, it seems like men are at the forefront of taking the abuse.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,"I said this in another thread, but:

The way that I look at it is this:

Taking politics aside, if you’re a person who starts to irritate me, I’ll pull away. Now add politics to the mix. If you irritate me, AND I vehemently disagree with your views and how you express them, you have no place in my life anymore. It’s healthier for us to part ways.",MilesToHaltHer,60115,People who cut off their family over politics are unhinged,"Any interpersonal relationship is more important than any political stance there is. This extends not only to family members, but your friends, you neighbors, the colleagues you drink with after work, your fellow church members, club members, anyone you can think of who's more than a stranger.

The people and your connection to them are real, your and their political beliefs are not real, they don't exist. Any civilized group of people should have an option of ""hey, let's not talk about politics"" and that's all. If you don't agree, then you're a barbarian.

Its not your ""high moral values"" that force you to cut off people from your life. They are just a justification you use to convince yourself that you are not just an asshole that dumps his homies over nothing. But in reality you are just an asshole.

They are toxic people who spew hatred and believe shit that is ass backwards and wrong.
