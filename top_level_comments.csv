ChangeMyView,"Cultural appropriation is unfortunately a politically charged term and a poorly defined one. 


I literally googled it just now and the first four definitions I got all disagreed with each other. 


If we define cultural appropriation as cultural exchange that is inappropriate - then by definition then it's inappropriate. 


If we define cultural appropriation as cultural exchange that is for ones own benefit - then whether it is moral or not depends on if that benefit comes at someones expense or not. As an example - if a native American tribe has a particular form of dress they are known for and they sell for profit - if a major retailer takes the design and the tribes sales fall - that can be seen as exploitative.

ChangeMyView,"This argument relies on the basic assumption that life in prison is such a horrific sentence that the state should explicitly allow and even assist with those who would rather commit suicide. That to me seems like a much much stronger argument in favor of improving the conditions of prisons. 

Additionally this policy inherents all of the potential problems with legalizing assisted suicide and a legal death penalty. 

On the death penalty side you have the potential of an innocent person ending their life after being sentenced. The problems with giving the state the power of life and death. 

On the assisted suicide side you have all of the problems with deciding who is in a right enough state of mind to make that decision, but also the victims of poor policy there are no longer sympathetic victims of terminal illness but life sentence criminals. Some of the least sympathetic persons with the least legal protections in the country. And instead of motivating factor being an untreatable terminal illness, its conditions that *we* created.

Finally, this would open the door to some very perverse incentives. On the prison end, prisons dealing with problematic inmates or state prisons looking to save on costs now have incentives to make conditions for said prisoners as terrible as possible to encourage them to… solve the problem themselves.

On the public end, allowing for prisoners to simply take their own life is a hampering force on any prison reform and accountability. “If things are so bad they always have another way out so what’s the problem”

Finally, this argument opens the door to a lot of problematic policy. The argument for this is that some things are so bad that people should be allowed to have the state assist with suicide. But that argument works in a lot of cases outside of life sentences. Why life, what about 70 years, 50 years, 20 years. Some people might find that concept so horrific they’d prefer to end it and why shouldn’t we let them. It’s not a slippery slope argument because it’s the same argument.

offmychest,You should title this post: “My parents ran my brother out of the family”,ebowski64,2569,My brother has cut off our family,"Im 23M and my brother is 26. My parents are pretty traditional chinese immigrant parents. Growing up my brother took a lot beatings until he was 15. Way more than I did. And sometimes they were BAD. 

As kids we got into a lot of fights and kinda grew apart. We didnt talk much since he turned 18. He didnt talk much at home in general. Only spoke when spoken to. He went to college for a program he didnt want to do right out of highschool because our parents wanted him to. He did 3 semesters before he told our parents he was going to take a leave from school for an indefinite amount time to pursue a different field of work to see how it goes. Obviously there was push back and after some back and forth, he says, ""Okay well im not asking for your permission, im just telling you im going to do it"" which resulted in my dad slapping him. I could see in my brothers eyes, he wanted to pummel him, but he didnt. He just left and went back to his place. 

He stopped visiting after that and for 2 years he only showed up at family gatherings. On chinese new year we had a big family dinner at my uncles house. Throughout the evening, my relatives would throw occasional, mostly light hearted, jabs at my brother about school. My parents half joked that he was going to become homeless without a real job and the rising cost of living. Our uncle then asked him if he had a girlfriend. My mom answered saying, ""Yea and shes white/a westerner"". My brother kept a straight face and acted as if nothing was said. My mom then said something along the lines of, ""are you really gonna have my grandchildren with some w**re"". At this point they were dating for almost 4 years I think. I looked at my brother, I thought that that was going to be the last straw. I thought he was about to freak out. But he got up and said he was going to the bathroom but actually just left and went home. 

After that, for the next 4 years we never saw him. The only time he and my parents talked were when they called him asking about his relationship or if he was ready to go back to school. Through every phone call, literally the only thing I heard him say in response to anything was, ""uh huh"" or ""idk"".

In september this year, while my parents and I were eating dinner, our doorbell rang. It was my brother. He handed my parents an envelope and left without saying a word. Inside was a copy of his degree certificate and a note, or atleast im assuming he got a second copy. The note read, ""Yes, I am going to have children with her but you wont be their grandparents. You will never meet my children""

They tried calling him but he changed his number and I think hes gone for good now.

My parents are pretty traditional chinese immigrant parents. Growing up my brother took a lot beatings until he was 15. Way more than I did. And sometimes they were BAD. 

As kids we got into a lot of fights and kinda grew apart. We didnt talk much since he turned 18. He didnt talk much at home in general. Only spoke when spoken to. He went to college for a program he didnt want to do right out of highschool because our parents wanted him to. He did 3 semesters before he told our parents he was going to take a leave from school for an indefinite amount time to pursue a different field of work to see how it goes. Obviously there was push back and after some back and forth, he says, ""Okay well im not asking for your permission, im just telling you im going to do it"" which resulted in my dad slapping him.

personalfinance,"For a lot of insurances, realize that the point of insurance is to cover losses that are **unaffordable** for you to replace. (Sentimental value is a value, especially with pets/jewelry, but do your research). What that number is changes person to person, but a high deductible will be cheaper month to month, as well as limit the amount of claims you make, which will keep payments low due to avoiding claims.

*most* insurance agents advise you to discuss with them prior to filing a claim, as they want to ensure a happy customer. This is probably double true for independent brokers. 

There's a ton of stories on here about people being dropped from their insurance due to making too many ""superfluous"" claims, i.e. small claims that generally people should take care of on their own.

Completely understand that it is a silly thing to pay for something that you should try to never use, but that's why it's insurance and not savings.

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Audit your insurance coverage!** How long has it been since you examined your coverage or gotten a quote from another company to look for cheaper insurance? As your life evolves, it's important to make sure you update your insurance coverage as well. This is also a good way to save some money if you can find a better deal for insurance elsewhere or if you find yourself overinsured in some specific area.

## Why insurance?

Insurance is an approach to handle the problem of *risk*. Most likely, during your life, one or more of these things will happen: you will be in a vehicle accident, you or someone close to you will experience serious illness or injury, or you will lose your job. Positive events have associated risk as well: ask anyone who has had a child, puppy, house, or marriage.

You can choose to *retain* each of those risks: decide that if the bad thing happens, you can afford to pay for it, to self-insure. For example, if you lose a laptop, you can buy another one. You can also *reduce* the risk, say, by not driving on icy streets or by having chains on your tires.  The other ways to deal with risk are to *avoid* it (don't buy a puppy) or *transfer* it (insurance!).

Most of us don’t think about risk until the bad thing happens. We are in a vehicle crash with an expensive car, someone is injured, and only then it dawns on us that we might be underinsured.

For many major risks, most people share the risk with an insurance company through various insurance products. If you own a vehicle, most likely you will be required by your state to have liability coverage (personal injuries and property damage caused by you). If you have a mortgage, your mortgage holder will require you to have homeowners insurance and some landlords will require renters insurance. Other types of insurance are optional, but may be desirable if available, for example, disability insurance.

## Audit your insurance coverage

Take a minute to think about what insurance coverage you currently have, whether you may be paying too much, and whether your coverage limits are appropriate:

* Car Insurance
* Health / Vision / Dental Insurance
* Life Insurance
* Homeowners / Renters Insurance
* Jewelry Insurance

Although insurance is an important financial tool to protect you against emergencies, it can also be a major drain on your budget. Insurance agents often use the fact that *some* insurance is important to make you feel that *the more insurance you have, the better off you are*.

It's wise to **only insure what you need to insure**. What do you need to insure? Anything that you could not easily afford to replace with your cash savings or where the loss would significantly set you back financially. In the next 30 days, review not only the types of insurance you have, but the level of coverage you have in each type. Here are some ideas for various types of insurance:

## Car Insurance

Assess all the types of coverage you have on your car. See the wiki article on [car insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/carinsurance) for more details and ways to save money. For example, if you drive less than 10,000 miles per year, call your insurance company and see if they provide a low-mileage discount.

Liability insurance is required by law if you drive and is very important: Would you be able to pay out a $300,000 lawsuit if you injure someone in a car accident? Liability insurance is not a great place to skimp.

Coverages for ""uninsured motorists"" (an uninsured or underinsured driver injures you or your passengers) and ""medical payments"" (you or your passengers are injured in an auto accident) are also worth having. They are less expensive than liability coverage and the irresponsibility of others is a major risk.

Also consider whether your ""collision"" and ""comprehensive"" deductibles coverage is appropriate or necessary, especially if you have an older car or significant savings. Eliminating or reducing these types of coverage can reduce your insurance bill, but you'll be left on the hook to replace or repair your own car if you (or mother nature) damage it.

Finally, when you see car insurance advertisements selling you ""better car replacement"" or ""one model year newer"" insurance, realize that this is a **great** deal for the insurer and not as great for their customers. Buying these policies mean that you're paying for a piece of a newer car every single month even though the odds of taking advantage of these policies are relatively low.

## Health / Vision / Dental Insurance

In the U.S., some form of catastrophic health insurance is vital for nearly everyone, as a week in an intensive care unit is enough to bankrupt all but the wealthiest. However, consider your expected use of healthcare services. If you are young and healthy, you may not need to fork over the extra dough for a *Gold* plan with lots of coverage. See the wiki article on [health insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health_insurance) for more details.

## Life Insurance

Remember the principle of insurance? ""Only insure what you couldn't afford to lose."" If you have children or a spouse that would be unable to maintain their standard of living without your income, *then you may need to insure your earning ability*. That means you take out a term life insurance policy that pays your spouse and/or dependents in the event that you die and can no longer earn money to provide for them. However, if you **don't** have dependents or if your spouse can earn enough money on their own to provide for themselves, you might not need life insurance at all.

It's also important for you to understand that there are two basic kinds of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance (like whole life or universal life). With term life insurance, you pay to cover your loved ones from the risk of your death. With whole life insurance, a portion of your cost goes to coverage, but it also has a cash value component that grows over time similar to an investment account.

While there may be some exceptions for the very wealthy, term life insurance tends to be the best choice for the vast majority of individuals.

Read our wiki article on [life insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/insurance) for a deeper discussion.

## Homeowners / Renters Insurance

Insurance on your residence is important for almost everyone who owns or rents a home. Owning a house without insurance could be disastrous if it burnt down, because you likely have a mortgage on it and probably don't have $250k cash to replace it. However, it may be worth checking how large your [deductible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductible) is. If it's only $1,500, you might be able to afford more than *that* in an emergency. If appropriate, you can increase your deductible to reduce your costs. Note that homeowners deductibles are per incident, though. See the wiki article on [homeowners insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/homeowners_insurance) for more details.

Renters insurance policies also tend to be very cheap (roughly $15 per month for $30,000 of property coverage and $100,000 of liability coverage).

Finally, make sure you have an up-to-date inventory of your property so any claims will be easier to make. An easy way to do this is taking a video on your phone as you walk through your home, naming everything as you walk through. Note the make and models of anything expensive like electronics. (Make an offsite or cloud copy of the video too!)

## Jewelry Insurance

Most single-issue insurance policies tend to be [poor deals for consumers](http://clark.com/insurance/insurance-you-can-stop-buying/). Opinions vary on jewelry insurance, but the default assumption of most people is to carry insurance on an engagement ring is more a product of the jewelry marketing machine than actual need. A few factors make jewelry insurance less necessary than other types of insurance:

* Your homeowners or renters insurance may already cover jewelry up to a certain value. Check!
* You should not even be buying jewelry that you couldn't afford to replace with cash.
* Most jewelry insurance does not cover accidental loss or misplacement. Only theft or damage. 
* Consider your (and your SO's) sentimental attachment to the piece. If your wife's engagement ring were stolen or lost, could you replace it with cash savings? Would you have a conversation about the importance of replacing it identically or go for a less expensive piece?

## Another way to save money

One thing to consider when reviewing your coverage is that sometimes companies offer discounts for having multiple accounts with them (e.g., a multi-policy discount or ""bundling""). When you call your insurance company, ask them about these discounts. For some insurers like USAA, you can even get a discount for adding non-insurance accounts like a savings account.

## A note on emergency funds

Following [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics), an emergency fund of cash equal to 3 to 6 months' worth of routine expenses is recommended. If you have no collision coverage on your car and rely on it to get to work, and/or a very high deductible on your home insurance ($10k), seriously consider the size of your emergency fund, and whether it is enough to get you through a ""double-whammy"" such as job loss and a car accident at the same time.

## Notes on other types of insurance

The bare minimum for most people is car insurance (if they drive), health insurance, term life insurance (if others depend on their income), and homeowners/renters insurance.  However, there are several additional types of insurance that some people may want to consider.  In particular:

- **Umbrella Insurance**: If your net worth exceeds the coverage limits for your car insurance liability or homeowners/renters liability (or your profession has high earning potential), you should evaluate whether umbrella insurance is appropriate for your situation.  Read more about [umbrella insurance in our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/umbrella_insurance) if this applies to you.
- **Long-Term Care Insurance**: If you're in your 50s (some financial advisors advise late 40s), you may want to start considering [whether LTC insurance makes sense for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/ltc_and_disability_insurance).
- **Disability Insurance**: Depending on your situation, [you may want to consider disability insurance as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/ltc_and_disability_insurance).

# Challenge success criteria

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done two or more of the following things:

* Reviewed the coverage limits on each of your policies and read the associated wiki page.  (Making changes is up to you and not something you should do without doing more research and reading.  This challenge is only about reviewing your insurance.)
* Read more about a type of insurance that you don't currently have.
* Created an up-to-date home inventory of your belongings.
* Requested a quote from a different insurance company or inquired about potential discounts from your current insurance company.
* Read the policy document for at least one of your insurance policies (you should know which ""perils"" the insurance company covers and which are excluded).

Buying these policies mean that you're paying for a piece of a newer car every single month even though the odds of taking advantage of these policies are relatively low.

## Health / Vision / Dental Insurance

In the U.S., some form of catastrophic health insurance is vital for nearly everyone, as a week in an intensive care unit is enough to bankrupt all but the wealthiest. However, consider your expected use of healthcare services. If you are young and healthy, you may not need to fork over the extra dough for a *Gold* plan with lots of coverage. See the wiki article on [health insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health_insurance) for more details.

## Life Insurance

Remember the principle of insurance? ""Only insure what you couldn't afford to lose."" If you have children or a spouse that would be unable to maintain their standard of living without your income, *then you may need to insure your earning ability*. That means you take out a term life insurance policy that pays your spouse and/or dependents in the event that you die and can no longer earn money to provide for them. However, if you **don't** have dependents or if your spouse can earn enough money on their own to provide for themselves, you might not need life insurance at all.

It's also important for you to understand that there are two basic kinds of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance (like whole life or universal life). With term life insurance, you pay to cover your loved ones from the risk of your death. With whole life insurance, a portion of your cost goes to coverage, but it also has a cash value component that grows over time similar to an investment account.

While there may be some exceptions for the very wealthy, term life insurance tends to be the best choice for the vast majority of individuals.

Read our wiki article on [life insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/insurance) for a deeper discussion.

## Homeowners / Renters Insurance

Insurance on your residence is important for almost everyone who owns or rents a home. Owning a house without insurance could be disastrous if it burnt down, because you likely have a mortgage on it and probably don't have $250k cash to replace it. However, it may be worth checking how large your [deductible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductible) is. If it's only $1,500, you might be able to afford more than *that* in an emergency. If appropriate, you can increase your deductible to reduce your costs. Note that homeowners deductibles are per incident, though. See the wiki article on [homeowners insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/homeowners_insurance) for more details.

Renters insurance policies also tend to be very cheap (roughly $15 per month for $30,000 of property coverage and $100,000 of liability coverage).

Finally, make sure you have an up-to-date inventory of your property so any claims will be easier to make. An easy way to do this is taking a video on your phone as you walk through your home, naming everything as you walk through. Note the make and models of anything expensive like electronics. (Make an offsite or cloud copy of the video too!)

## Jewelry Insurance

Most single-issue insurance policies tend to be [poor deals for consumers](http://clark.com/insurance/insurance-you-can-stop-buying/). Opinions vary on jewelry insurance, but the default assumption of most people is to carry insurance on an engagement ring is more a product of the jewelry marketing machine than actual need. A few factors make jewelry insurance less necessary than other types of insurance:

* Your homeowners or renters insurance may already cover jewelry up to a certain value. Check!
* You should not even be buying jewelry that you couldn't afford to replace with cash.
* Most jewelry insurance does not cover accidental loss or misplacement. Only theft or damage. 
* Consider your (and your SO's) sentimental attachment to the piece. If your wife's engagement ring were stolen or lost, could you replace it with cash savings? Would you have a conversation about the importance of replacing it identically or go for a less expensive piece?

## Another way to save money

One thing to consider when reviewing your coverage is that sometimes companies offer discounts for having multiple accounts with them (e.g., a multi-policy discount or ""bundling""). When you call your insurance company, ask them about these discounts. For some insurers like USAA, you can even get a discount for adding non-insurance accounts like a savings account.

## A note on emergency funds

Following [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics), an emergency fund of cash equal to 3 to 6 months' worth of routine expenses is recommended. If you have no collision coverage on your car and rely on it to get to work, and/or a very high deductible on your home insurance ($10k), seriously consider the size of your emergency fund, and whether it is enough to get you through a ""double-whammy"" such as job loss and a car accident at the same time.

## Notes on other types of insurance

The bare minimum for most people is car insurance (if they drive), health insurance, term life insurance (if others depend on their income), and homeowners/renters insurance.  However, there are several additional types of insurance that some people may want to consider.  In particular:

- **Umbrella Insurance**: If your net worth exceeds the coverage limits for your car insurance liability or homeowners/renters liability (or your profession has high earning potential), you should evaluate whether umbrella insurance is appropriate for your situation.  Read more about [umbrella insurance in our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/umbrella_insurance) if this applies to you.
- **Long-Term Care Insurance**: If you're in your 50s (some financial advisors advise late 40s), you may want to start considering [whether LTC insurance makes sense for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/ltc_and_disability_insurance).
- **Disability Insurance**: Depending on your situation, [you may want to consider disability insurance as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/ltc_and_disability_insurance).

personalfinance,"Recently turned 27 and finally hit 100K Net Worth!

Recently turned 27 earlier this month and just did a quick calculation and was surprised to see I finally hit it! Here are my stats: 

Physical Cash - 5.7

Checking - 1.3

RH - 47.6 (12.6 in HYSA - 35 vested)

Roth - 23.5

401K - 21.5

HSA - 1.1

Very grateful to reach this milestone. Wanted to reach it at age 25 but life had other plans 😂 Quick summary:

-Graduated college debt free due to help from parents and free tuition

-First job was making 65K a year and did not max out my 401K. Did not budget and just let my Roth IRA sit there unvested.

-At the end of year 2 I got fired. I was making 74K at the time. 

-Sold my Mustang GT for 2K profit and then proceeded to travel for a couple months. Again did not budget but roughly spent 10K traveling SE Asia for 4 months. 

-At current job I make 85K Base + 8.5K target bonus. 

-I am beyond grateful for my parents for paying for my school and plus I lived at home ever since and do not pay rent or utilities. I pay for car insurance and that’s about it. Planning to give them the entirety of my bonus this Christmas. Hoping to find a higher paying job eventually as many of my peers in the same industry are making 125-200K. My biggest weakness is definitely sticking to my budget. My goal was to spend no more than 1K a month (wants and needs included) but I’ve been tracking my spending for the past 8 months and on average I spend 1300-1700 a month.

A couple weeks ago, I went to a fancy gym for a free intro class. They required that I put a credit card on file before the class (in my experience at other nice gyms this is standard). 

I took the class and left. The sales associate started texting me offers and asking me to join. Via text, I said I was interested in joining. Via text, he briefly went over the cost and asked if he could email me a contract that I could sign electronically, and I said okay. 

At that point, I stopped responding to them. I was super busy, and I knew their expensive gym didn't really fit into my budget. I DID NOT SIGN THE CONTRACT, AND DID NOT COMMUNICATE WITH THEM FURTHER AFTER IT WAS SENT. I have not set foot in the gym since the introduction class which was over a week ago. 

Then, I checked my credit card statement, and saw that they had charged me $250! ($175 monthly dues plus $75 joining fee). 

I figured there must be a mistake, and I called and spoke with the manager/ owner. ""No mistake,"" he said, ""the written contract was just a formality; you already entered into the contract with your texts."" He emailed me screen shots of the texts; the text where I said ""okay,"" in response to them stating the monthly cost and asking if they could email me the contract, and the text where I said I was interested in joining (which was sent BEFORE they sent me the contract). 

I insisted that they reverse the charges and cancel my monthly membership, and threatened other actions (BBB, attorney generals office, small claims). He laughed and insisted that he would win any of those disputes, saying that in Missouri texts are considered legally binding. He also refused to process my cancelation at that time, saying that, per the contract (which I'd never signed), it requires 30 days notice, so I would still owe the next monthly charge scheduled for 28 days from then. Furthermore, he said in order to cancel I have to cancel through their website; when you try to cancel on the website it makes you click on a box acknowledging that you agree to their 30 day cancellation policy and agree to be charged your monthly fee one more time before the cancelation is final, and, since I've never agreed to that previously, I did not want to click and agree to it now. 

I called my credit card and disputed the charges, which they reversed. 

Now I'm receiving emails from the gym owner threatening to send my account to collections! I have great credit and I'm super worried about what this could do. I never signed the contract nor did I explicitly agree to any of the contract terms in our texts, but clearly this gym owner thinks my texts are good enough to charge me hundreds of dollars.

Continue to ignore them. If (big if) a collection appears on your report, send a debt validation letter (wiki has a guide) and it will go away because they won't be able to provide proof of the debt.  
  
It's Missouri, so maybe not, but your state's attorney general might be have a way to report this type of fraud, which might get them an angry letter from the state.

AskScience,"We see somewhat analogous (though not exactly contemporaneous) events in many of the Paratethyan basins, specifically in the Black and Caspian Seas - at least in terms of large base level drops such that surface of these lakes were likely at least several 100 meters below modern sea level, though neither are characterized by thick evaporites like what is seen in the Mediterranean (e.g., [van Baak et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825217301113), [Krijgsman et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001282521830415X)). The examples in the Black and Caspian Seas are broadly similar to the Mediterranean as all of these effectively reflect remnant ocean basins that were intermittently (or pretty regularly in the case of the Med) connected to the global ocean and experienced base level falls during periods of isolation, though the Black and Caspian Seas also experienced high-stands during periods of isolation.

In a more general sense, when considering endoheric basins, we know that they can be characterized by relatively extreme base level variations (e.g., [Bohacs et al., 2003](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/books/edited-volume/519/chapter-abstract/3801181/Lessons-from-large-lake-systems-Thresholds)).

This is a cross-section of a coil. Crosses are current flowing away from you, dots are current flowing towards you.

If you look at two dots (which are two parallel wires with current flowing in the same direction), halfway in between the two dots their magnetic fields will cancel out as you say. But if you look in the middle of the coil, everything is adding up. You're halfway in between a dot and a cross (parallel wires with opposite current), so those add. All the dots are on one side of the middle of the coil, so all those add instead of cancel.",imMAW,13758,Why don't magnetic field lines between the wires of a coil cancel out?,"Take two parallel wires with current in both wires flowing in the same direction. Eschewing a mathematical treatment, simply apply the right hand rule. The magnetic field lines between the wires will be in opposing directions and, if I understand correctly, cancel out. Push the wires together in a coil and apparently the magnetic fields constructively interfere, creating a magnet out of the coil with a north pole and south pole at the coil terminals. How do we account for this? What am I misunderstanding?",124,2024-11-14 13:41:41
AskScience,">  How fast is Train Y relative to Train Z?

Whenever asking ""how fast is something"" when dealing with relativity, you always have to add on another part to the question: ""as measured by...""

So, how fast is Train Y relative to Train Z as measured by Train X? c. Or, if they were traveling at 0.6c then 1.2c. And this is fine. Relativity says ""you will never measure an object traveling faster than 'c'"" and you don't. You measure two objects, each moving at 0.6c. Nothing is broken here. 

But, how fast is Train Y moving relative to Train Z as measured by Train Y? Well, of course it has to be less than c. But that's ok because they have different frames of reference, so no reason for them to measure the same speed. To know how fast Train Y measures Train Z moving, you have to use the [velocity addition formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula). Doing so, you'll see that Train Y measures Train Z moving at ~88% the speed of light. 

Now, that equation gives you the tool to answer the question, but doesn't really answer ""why."" But like normal, when dealing with relativity type questions, it comes down to length contraction and time dilation. Train X sees the trains approaching each other at 1.2c. Train Y sees itself as stationary, and Train Z approaching at 0.88c. That's because, as measured by Train X, Train Y's clock is ticking slower (time dilation) and Train Y's is measuring a shorter distance between it and Train Z (length contraction) both of which make the measured velocity slower (since velocity is length/time, and Train Y measures a shorter length and a longer time).",Weed_O_Whirler,369646,How does relativity work when two Trains move with near Light Speed against each other?,"I have three trains (X, Y and Z) of equal proportions on separate parallel tracks in space. Each train is equipped with measurement tools to keep track of the speed, length and direction of the other trains.  
Train X stands still while Train Y goes with 50% light speed in one direction while Train Z goes with 50% light speed in the opposite direction. **How fast is Train Y relative to Train Z?** What would happen when we add even more speed to each train? (Train X is just an anchor point)

Common sense would say 0.5c+0.5c=1.0c but then 0.6c+0.6c=1.2c and that's impossible, is it?",246,2024-11-13 15:42:30
AskScience,"Remember time dilation? That means the clocks on the trains don't run the speed of the clock on train X.  


Basically you're mixing up inertial frames because you're measuring the trains going 50% of the speed of light using your clock but they don't measure that with their clock",joepierson123,61016,How does relativity work when two Trains move with near Light Speed against each other?,"I have three trains (X, Y and Z) of equal proportions on separate parallel tracks in space.

Writing,"Hi everyone! New here. I know I want to write, I've been knowing this for a long time, I just don't know what to write about.

I also am a graphic designer and filmmaker, and I happen to have the same problem. If there's someone else giving me the topic or the briefing, I can deliver the job, and I think I'm good at it. But when it's me who has to think what to talk about, my mind goes full blank.

It's always been like this, especially during my academic years.

I think this might be related to the pressure to do something *actually* good. It's not that I can't think of any topics at all, I have some recurrent ideas, I just think they're not good or interesting enough.

I'm diagnosed with schizophrenia the story is about my experience with it 




Chapter 2 Anthony Williams
 
Anthony felt the need to talk to himself, but the conversations would sometimes get too passionate. Having these talks in front of other people makes him look crazy, and he is scared of what the outside world might do. Fear ruled him. Like taking a fish out of water, he suffocates the conversation by thinking of something to say whenever someone is around. Often trying to break the ice with a joke and other times commenting on things they might find interesting. He hones the skill of small talk with any given opportunity. 
 
At times it backfired, leaving an awkward silence in its wake and forcing him to rejoin the conversation in his head. When he's alone and uncomfortable with the subject in his head, he says random things. In an attempt to be funny and change the topic with humor. Sometimes it works, other times it's short-lived. When he was in these situations, he scrambled for a way out. Video games could be a refuge, as well as TV and reading. Though the reading gave him headaches. Even though he enjoyed it, he could only read a few pages at a time. 
 
Television and video games are the easiest to get lost in due to his headaches. Ignoring the voices is his solution, which caused them to build. Ultimately, the voices and outline would confine him to the caboose. A dark corner of the mind where he's trapped and alone. He wants to be surrounded by people, connection, and camaraderie. In this prison, such something doesn't exist.
The voices team up and speak on subjects that he has little to no frame of reference. So commenting feels irrelevant. He is a child and therefore should stay in a child's place.
 
In the morning, his mother decides to keep him from school. She takes him to breakfast at a buffet restaurant. His excitement is overwhelming, bursting in his body. Over and over, pulsing like a heartbeat, biting his tongue is the only thing that can keep him from leaping out of his skin. The day got better from there. After enjoying his breakfast, his mother took him to Blockbuster Video to buy a new game. Zelda Ocarina of Time read the box over and over, waiting to get home. Thank you, Mom; he exclaimed your welcome, sweetie.
 
A few days passed, and he is now getting ready for school. He hears his mom tell Jr. he can stay home today. They are going out to breakfast, and Anthony couldn't help but think, Why does he get to stay home? The thought quickly disappeared when he thought about his day home. His brother should have one too with that he was off to school. Arriving at school, he went to converse with friends. There were a set of twins in his class. Chris and Clint. Kids often made fun of each other's shortcomings. Clint was trying to speak, and Chris said, “Shut up, p, Clit!"" We all laughed. Anthony felt bad afterwards and said something reassuring to Clint. 
He generally felt bad after burns such as that, so he'd habitually try to encourage the target. This didn't stop him from participating in the jokes. At school is a heavy-set girl named Corina. He and his friends called her Godzilla. The bell rang, and they ventured to Mr. Ritzdorf’s class. 
After breakfast, the first assignment is to write a short story. He quickly started, and before long he was finished. The students go up one at a time and read them. So excited because he feels his story is better than everything he's heard so far. It's his turn now. With enthusiasm, he acts out the story being a short story. It didn't take long. 
Mr. Ritzdorf congratulated him on a well told story he floated back to his seat. Cody was up next. He didn't take the assignments seriously; his story was goofy. Sounds like he's making it up on the spot. Anthony paid attention but felt his story was far superior. Nonetheless he got the same congratulation. That was all it took for him to doubt Mr. Ritzdorf's judgment.",Infinite_Ear_8860,202,[Weekly Critique and Self-Promotion Thread] Post Here If You'd Like to Share Your Writing,"Your critique submission should be a top-level comment in the thread and should include:

Writing,"Instead of blindly cutting scenes you need to consider if they’re worth keeping or not. As a new author, you probably DO need to cut a lot of stuff, but you might also be a me to split it into two or three books",Cookieway,90616,"See here: An idiot who wrote 375,000 words for a novel","Yes, as the title states, I spent the past 30 months working on the first draft of what I had hope to be my debut novel, which more or less ended with 375,000 words. 

Right before I finished the draft (or manuscript, which seems to be the term being used), I started to actually research the market expectations regarding debut novels. 

I only just found out that the expectation for a debut is around 60,000 to 100,000 words for a standalone, and that 120,000 words is considered too long.

I crumpled to dust then and there, less due to the massive task of rewrites and revisions that was my immediate future— that I was ready for— but more due to the realization that I have wasted two years of my life working on scenes that are basically useless. I’ve already cried. I’ve already spent the past couple of days looking at the mirror and calling myself an idiot. I did that both in real life and in my dreams, by the way. We’re not even supposed to be able to control our dreams, but somehow I still did it while deep in slumberland, which I believe illustrates just how devastated I feel.

I do have a plan already— condense, cut, rewrite, revise. I have whole arcs that I would cut, whole storylines that’s vanishing in the void forever, and if I were to be honest I actually feel relieved they won’t see the light of day. I have a plan, which is the one thing that anchors my sanity from spiraling deep into the near-inescapable void of self-pity.

I guess I just wasn’t expecting to face the reality of the utter uselessness of my efforts this way.

Advice,"I'm so sorry that your trust has been so violated by your own father. My father was a perverted weirdo as well but to my cousins etc. They dont deserve daughters. Its gotten to the point where you have trauma and are deeply impacted by it. Its a painful and confusing situation and Im sorry you are in the thick of it. I hope you have a good support system and can heal from this. Its easy to say you should confront him but I think therapy would do wonders for you and maybe with the support of a therapist, you can eventually confrojt him and express the impact his vile behavior has had on you. Ty for sharing such a painful part of your life. I know it wasnt easy.",Sadikd5,382,I think my dad was a pervert ,"I have never told anyone about this. But I just need someone to know and give their opinion.

It started when I was ~6. My dad would help me get dressed after showers. He’d rub in moisturiser and sometimes he’d have showers with me. At this point it didn’t feel weird and I’d enjoy the showers. It used to be fun. He’d hit me a lot back then so idk it was a nice change?

It started feeling weird when I was 9 or 10. He’d insist on rubbing cream on me after showers even though I’d tell him to stop and that I was big enough to do it myself. I think I complained enough that my mum made him stop. 

I have really vague memories but I know that sometimes I’d be masturbating and he’d be there. But idk how those situations arose or what the context was. I used to masturbate a lot as a kid but it used to make me feel sick. I just couldn’t stop idk. 

When I was a teenager he’d cuddle me in the morning. It started off normal - just affectionate hugs. But then he’d start spooning me and wrapping his legs around me. I’d try to wriggle away and push him off but he’d clamp me. Back then I knew that it was weird because I could feel his private and I’d try and avoid it. It was only when I was older, spooning with my 1st bf that I realised I’d been feeling a boner. 

Around 15/16/17 he’d slap my ass a lot. If I was just walking past him, etc. I hated it and would tell him to stop. I think it weirded out my mum too because she made him stop. A few times he’s grabbed my breasts while we were play fighting. I felt really uncomfortable but idk I thought maybe it wasn’t as weird as I was making it out to be. It was never anything more so I really didn’t know what to think. 
 
There are other things that happened and all I can think is…wait that wasn’t appropriate at all. 

He wasn’t a great dad growing up. He was physical, short tempered and just a massive bully. But he’s been trying really hard to support me in my twenties. He’s funds my hobbies and education. He’s not perfect at all but I know he cares. 

I don’t want to think my dad was weird. It’s been easier to pretend it was normal and nothing major. But nowadays I can’t sleep. I’ve struggled with self harm, depression, psychosis, etc. etc. I don’t know how to come to term with things. I feel gross? I love him despite all the awful things he’s put me through. 

Idk I’m a mess, can anyone relate to what I’m going through? ",108,2024-11-14 21:56:52
Advice,First and foremost get into therapy asap. This is not normal but your response is normal for trauma. Your dad is not a good dad and I believe his love and support is for his guilt.

Advice,Narrator - Things were not great and they were not amazing together,According-Sympathy52,5260,Girlfriend says she's not in love with me anymore.,"My (36M) gf (32F) and I had been together for nearly 5 years. Things were great and we were amazing together. A couple months ago she mentioned one of her ex's messaged her and they just talked again. Well a few weeks ago I noticed she started texting him alot amd would take her phone with her everywhere. I told her I was concerned about it amd she swore to me they were just talking and told me the things they talked about. I told her i wouldn't be the controlling boyfriend that tells her to stop talking to him but it worried me. Then a few days ago i mention that I finally got her an engagement ring, to which she then says that I should take it back because she loves me but no longer loves me the way she should. I asked her if it was the ex and she swears its not. She said she had these feelings momentarily other times but always ignored it. Her main issue is that we dont go out much. (Which is true, i unfortunately am a home-body so thats on me) I still cant shake the feeling though that her texting her ex may have had something to do with this even though I've never had any reason to doubt her before this. Am i overthinkibg things or do you think she may have been emotionally involved with her ex again? Do i fight to save the relationship or just move on? 


Update: after talking some more we broke it off. I had the ring refunded so no loss there. The house we're living is in her parents name but she doesnt want it so i will be buying it from them (at the price they currently owe on it) . We agreed she and her daughter continue living here till she finds a new place as long as she keeps paying her part of the bills. It sucks, and i feel heartbroken, but i realized that its best to move on for both our sakes. Thanks for all the comments. I genuinely believe she is a good person, even if she did emotionally cheat. I know that sounds stupid, but it takes two to make a relationship work so i gotta take my own blame in this failing. Gonna spend some time working out what i want after this.

Also, does your girlfriend get cold sores? Because if you have genital herpes 1, then she could have passed it to you from oral sex while asymptomatically shedding or having an active outbreak.

She’s truly amazing and the work she does is really heartwarming.",TheGirlwThePinkHair,123918,Human Trafficking Facts and Stats,"Hi, everyone. Due to the nature of this subreddit and because it's a hot button topic on social media in general, we receive a *lot* of posts and comments about encounters being possible human trafficking.



Unfortunately, there is a massive amount of misinformation about what human trafficking is and isn't, and the vast majority of these interactions here in this subreddit and elsewhere on social media are not how trafficking typically occurs.



# **What is human trafficking, anyway?**



Human trafficking is the exploitation ([thanks to u/officialfourloko for pointing this out!](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/16t9o8w/human_trafficking_facts_and_stats/k2ub7cp/)) of people through coercion, deception, force and any combination of those three, for sex, labor, or both. Human trafficking DOES NOT usually occur by spotting some girl alone out and about, following her and kidnapping her or ""tagging"" her to kidnap later. For sex trafficking in particular, the people trafficked almost *always* know and often times love or trust the person that trafficked them. 



Human trafficking is, disgustingly, a business, and it'd be bad for business to grab some random girl that might have a rich family to look for her, and to do so in front of witnesses. While there have been a few cases of trafficking that have occurred that way (it's sensational and scary, or we wouldn't know about it), it is by far the exception and not the rule. You are more likely to be trafficked by a romantic partner than anyone else.


# **How it happens**


""The most pervasive myth about human trafficking is that it often involves kidnapping or physically forcing someone into a situation. In reality, most traffickers use psychological means such as, tricking, defrauding, manipulating or threatening victims into providing commercial sex or exploitative labor. Another myth is that traffickers target victims they don't know. Many survivors have been trafficked by romantic partners, including spouses, and by family members, including parents."" - Polaris Project



""Perpetrators of human trafficking span all racial, ethnic, and gender demographics and are as diverse as survivors. Some use their privilege, wealth, and power as a means of control while others experience the same socio-economic oppression as their victims. They include individuals, business owners, members of a gang or network, parents or family members of victims, intimate partners, owners of farms or restaurants, and powerful corporate executives and government representatives."" - Polaris Project


# **Recent Statistics**


Based on data* from the [2021 National Report](https://humantraffickinghotline.org/en/resources/2021-national-report) by The Human Trafficking Hotline:



* **72% of trafficking is for sex**, 10% is for forced labor, 4% is for both sex and labor, with the remaining 14% being for unspecified purposes.



* 62% of sex trafficking victims are adults, **28% are minors**. In some cases, demographic information is not provided to the hotline, which is why the percentage here doesn't add up to 100%.



* 84% of sex trafficking victims are female, 8% are male, with the remaining 8% having another gender identity, defined as someone who identifies as any identity other than cisgender male or female.



In the vast majority of cases (88%), the country of origin of victims was unknown. When the country of origin *was* known, the majority of victims were US citizens. 



*note: this data is all from substantiated tips received by the hotline from January 1, 2021 until December 31, 2021, most of which came from victims themselves.

Don’t follow the vultures might be one of my faves",skidrow6969,12561,What Belongs Here,"I'm getting real sick of people getting shitty over their stories being removed, so here's a list of stories that inarguably belong here. If you read this thread and you have a story, compare it to any of these. If it wouldn't fit in with this list of stories, *it does not belong on this subreddit.* Usually if you're not sure if a story belongs here, it doesn't. 


1. [They stalked all the stay at home moms](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/7bhjfl/they_stalked_all_the_stay_at_home_moms) - I don't think I need to explain why this fits. I know there is some skepticism in the comments, but as OP was interactive with them prior to deleting her account (typically creative writing pieces OP doesn't respond to many, if any, comments), I think it's okay to leave up. 

2. [This happened quite a long time ago yet it is never too far from my mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/gi7emq/this_happened_quite_a_long_time_ago_yet_it_is) - this fits because although OP made it out unharmed and nothing really happened, the insistence of ""coming up here"" and the fact the creeper left *surgical shears* where they are not needed pushes this story into ""out of the ordinary"" 

3. [No good deed goes unpunished](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1g3x4f/no_good_deed_goes_unpunished) - Here is an example of a car story that would actually remain up. It takes place almost entirely in the car, but it is not someone just following her, or road raging and she goes home physically unharmed. This would be terrifying to go through. (Side note: this is also one of my favorite stories of all time as I love it when assholes like this get their due comeuppance) 

4. [I was a victim of sex trafficking](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/p1bmel/i_was_a_victim_of_sex_trafficking) - this is a real story about actual human trafficking. If you ""think"" you escaped human trafficking, most likely you didn't. Human trafficking overwhelmingly does not happen the way most people think it does, the reality is truly insidious and horrifying. 

5. [The office in the middle of nowhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1t2uwq/the_office_in_the_middle_of_nowhere) - I don't think I really need to explain this one either, I just wanted an example for the ""found something creepy/bizarre"" category. 


As a reminder, stories posted in this subreddit should have been life threatening (stories 1 and 3), extremely unusual/uncommon (stories 2 and 4) or about a time when you stumbled upon something excessively creepy (story 5). 


# What does not belong here? 

* You *think* you were followed because somebody was acting weird but you didn't interact much, if at all and eventually they either gave up or you lost them with minimal effort on your part (so didn't have to hide/confront them) 

* You can't say for certain what someone's intentions were, you can only guess at what they were doing or planning. 

* Being harassed/stared at/catcalled. I understand how frightening and enraging this is, but if you're a woman and you live in any moderately sized city or larger, you will have experienced this. It's entirely too common to be worthy of a story here. That doesn't change the fact it's threatening, disgusting, disrespectful behavior, but this subreddit is meant to focus on, again, life-threatening encounters.
 * an additional note here: stories containing excessive detail about your personal appearance will be removed, even if they fit the standards for this sub. It's a harmful belief to perpetuate in multiple directions that only conventionally attractive people get creeped on - anyone can be harassed on the street. Oftentimes what you look like has little, if anything to do with it, it's the loser's complete lack of regard and view of you as a person and (and for women, lack of respect for us) that causes them to harass you. If our appearance mattered that much for it, 11/12 year olds that look very much like children to anyone with an ounce of brain matter would not get catcalled. 

* The encounter didn't happen to you, but happened to your mother, sister, father, friend, aunt, etc. 

I reserve the right to edit this post to add/remove stories as I see fit, as well as adjust formatting. I suppose we could use this post as well for any comments/suggestions for the sub, cuz why not.

Oftentimes what you look like has little, if anything to do with it, it's the loser's complete lack of regard and view of you as a person and (and for women, lack of respect for us) that causes them to harass you. If our appearance mattered that much for it, 11/12 year olds that look very much like children to anyone with an ounce of brain matter would not get catcalled. 

* The encounter didn't happen to you, but happened to your mother, sister, father, friend, aunt, etc. 

I reserve the right to edit this post to add/remove stories as I see fit, as well as adjust formatting. I suppose we could use this post as well for any comments/suggestions for the sub, cuz why not.

I see them asked in the comments all the time, so I'm guessing DMs are worse, and I just don't think it's right for people to scroll this sub looking to market off of people's trauma.

Now that I've said my piece, back to the reason I'm here.

I'm 22F, and work as a private investigator. Let me clarify up front that it is not that exciting of a job. It's actually fairly mundane. Due to my age and six months of limited experience, I don't tackle super complicated cases. Some cases I have guidance. I'm still very much learning things every day.

This is my first time traveling for work. I'll also stress that the case I'm working is a bluecollar fraud case. Nothing crazy. Again, pretty mundane.

When I was done doing my thing for the day, I walked across the road to go get something to eat. That took about 45 minutes from the time I sat down to the time that I paid my check.

I had an unexpected visitor while I was washing my hands in the bathroom. I won't give too many details about who that unexpected visitor was, but I needed to go buy tampons.

I went back to my motel room, showered, changed, and settled in on my iPad while the TV played in the background. Eventually I fell asleep and woke up around 7. 

When I go downstairs, I find three of my tires slashed. I have a dashcam on my car, but I take it off when I'm parked for the night to conserve the memory, which was kind of a dumb mistake.

I called the police and filed a report, but that was about it. As in that's all they really did. I had to ask the front desk clerk to see the security footage, which I was denied. I did ask the officer that responded if there was anything I could do about that, and he simply said he couldn't force them to show the security footage without a warrant. So so so silly.

Anyone who knows the goings on at most Motel 6's can probably hypothesize why they refused to show security camera footage to police. 

I called the agency that I work for and asked for assistance, but was told they were in no position to assist. Thanks. That's probably going to be something mentioned in the letter that I wrote when I quit once I get back.

That was this morning. I'm still here, having to pay for another night in this place out of pocket.

I'll have to find a way to get to Wal Mart in the morning and find out about getting three tires for my car so I can drive out of here.

Guy or gal who slashed my tires, lets not meet. You do your thing and just let me do my thing. Slashing 3/4 tires so I can't claim them in my insurance is low. And I'm honestly not letting go of the idea that they may have followed me. I've seen too much ID to know that it's not safe to assume safety. I'd rather be cautious and be wrong than to be ignorant and be wrong.

Hope everyone else's Wednesday is going good.",81,2024-11-13 21:07:04

SelfImprovement,"This is mostly solid, but why only non-fiction? Reading only non-fiction can give you a shallow and solipsistic ""LinkedIn bro"" type of knowledge base, vs. the deeper type of cultural knowledge that comes from literature/art. I'd be particularly wary of any reading plan that leans too far toward 'self-improvement' or how-to books. Deeper, well-researched books on history, culture etc are totally fine, but I'd recommend mixing in a solid contingent of literary fiction too.


Also, can't emphasize enough that the ""he didn't sleep"" part is comic-book fantasy and not good advice for real self-improvement. It's shocking how much fixing and prioritizing sleep can solve, both mentally and physically.",occurrenceOverlap,9360,Break life's back in half: Using Bane's prison routine to improve your life,"I was talking to a friend of mine, who is a massive comic book fan (I've dropped out of that field about 12 years ago), and I realized how Bane, one of Batman's greatest foes, can be used as a tool to self-improve (whilst ignoring the fact he's a drug-addicted criminal). 

This little guide will be simple and concise. Why? Because it was for Bane - the dude grew up in a hellacious prison with little resources. He had it worse than almost anyone, so there's no excuse for you. The guide, and routine, is as follows:

1. Physical exercise: surprisingly, Bane's prison routine did not include weights, just bodyweight exercises (4 exercises for 1000 repetitions is OVERKILL, but we're taking a concept here to apply to our lives, we're not literally copying what Bane did). This is actually perfect if you're overweight or weak in terms of your strength. Naturally, if you like weights more and/are already advanced past the beginner stage, do that instead. A strong body equals more confidence, more attention, more respect, and more power.

2. Reading books: Bane read 3 books a day, which is virtually impossible for anyone that isn't locked up (and even then it's absurd), but the idea of literature being knowledge is, was and always will be true. Bane read everything - from math to weapons training books, and you should as well (as long as it's non-fiction). Self improvement books, science books, skill-learning books, whatever. Knowledge will make you resourceful, a weapon.

3. Martial arts: surviving prison is a hard task to achieve without some proper combat experience, and Bane knew that. I've recently taken up boxing, which is an idea given to me by a friend. Never in a million years did I see myself doing that, but I did and now I love it. Martial arts offer great workouts, more confidence, respect from men, a valuable skill, and new friendships. 

4. Meditation: Bane didn't sleep, instead he meditated for 4 hours every day. Again, it's a comic book, so we cannot apply this literally, but the mental, spiritual and emotional benefits of meditation are demonstrably true. Whether it's for 5, 15, or 50 minutes on a daily basis, releasing all the negative energy out of your body and disconnecting from the world will undoubtedly make you happier. 

5. Positive social interactions: again, Bane's friends were horrible people that didn't really care for him, but the overarching lesson here is that most of them taught him invaluable lessons, whether directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally. Only surround yourself with those who will help you grow, and be genuinely happy for the fact you're growing.

6. Minimalism: unfortunately, in the world we live today, we're conditioned to think material possessions are somehow going to fill voids inside of us. Hinduists called materialism to worst lifestyle to have, and for good reason - you're spending a fortune on things that are worthless. You're wasting months of hard work on something that'll make you happy for a few days. Learn to appreciate the small things in life.

7. Keep moving forward: no matter what's happened, no matter what kind of horrendous pain you're going through, always march forward. Light might not be ahead of you for a while, and the tunnel might be long, but in the end you'll see the sunlight again, and confront it as a much stronger individual than you were going in.",184,2024-11-14 12:35:19

DecidingToBeBetter,"**Just a few of my thoughts on deciding to be better.** To better personal living you have to discover competence to take charge. In life we have inner coaches, counselors, etc that help us to accomplish things in life. We likewise have helpful authorities in the world who will take the time to help those who find it hard to help themselves. You've a lot of options and resources available to you.

Competency is earned. An individual with competence will take what they learn and utilize it to solve different states of affairs in their life. A competent individual always sees the new light at the end of every tunnel.

When an individual has competence, he or she feels joyous. A joyous individual will consider every incident, experience and so forth in life as something they may learn from; as well this individual won't allow bad weight him or her down. The individual will take the bad; see new light and continue learning from his or her errors.

You'll have to learn how to suspend judgments of self and other people. You're not the Man in control. Only one spiritual being has the right to call judgment down on anybody. Let this Man take the weight on His shoulders. You might need to pray often to cease judging self and other people.

It's ok to have views, but when you don't have facts to support your claims, why speak. Too many times individuals suspect, offer opinions, speculate, or jump to conclusions, which has caused major issues in the world. If you don't have facts behind you, or to support what you say, be quiet. Allow somebody else in the world to make the next error.

If you wish to live happier, you'll need to build your energy. To build energy you'll need to eat right, exercise and take great care of you. You'll need to associate with positive individuals and learn to help others as well as yourself. The more effort you put forth, the more you'll get back from your efforts.",WelbonWorkOnline,1,Join us on the r/DecidingToBeBetter Official Discord Server!,,318,2021-10-21 23:37:45

I got a lot of positive feedback and practical tips. Three weeks later, I have implemented your advice and it has been a night and day difference. I wanted to share this here too since it seems like we are all going through it and maybe it will help someone.

**The results:**

* Daily screen time: 6hrs >>> 2 hrs
* Daily phone pickups: 250 >>> 50
* I feel less “scatterbrained” (slightly lol)
* My kids are noticing

**Phone free spaces:**

* I made several places “phone free”, and communicated that to my kids
* Now they know when they are going to get my full attention
* I did the playroom and kitchen table

* I locked myself out of social media first thing in the morning, and during dinner time (and told my kids)
* For the rest of the day, I set a limit of 15 unblocks on social media
* I'm also tracking my daily screen time and how often I pick up my phone more closely

* I reach for my phone when I got stressed, tired, etc.
* When I notice this feeling coming on, I will communicate with my kids
* ex: “I need a few minutes on my phone and then I'll be back”
* Then I will try to call a friend or family to talk about it

AskHistorians,"In the time period I'm interested in, most naval engagements are the result of a fleet trying to do a thing and another fleet trying to stop it. In some cases, the fleet has already accomplished its mission when attacked; in others, the fleet is attacked to prevent a future threat; and in at least one case (the battle of the Glorious First of June) two fleets stumbled on one another about 400 miles away from the nearest land and fought a running battle that resulted in a British tactical victory. But for the most part, fleets fought in restricted waters relatively close to land, because those were the places most likely to find an enemy fleet, or conversely those places that a fleet would be carrying troops to attack. 

Of Nelson's three large fleet engagements, two involved enemy fleets in harbor -- the battle of the Nile took place after Napoleon's invasion of Egypt, when Nelson attacked the anchored French fleet in Aboukir Bay, and the battle of Copenhagen took place when Nelson attacked the Danish fleet to prevent it from falling into French hands. His victory at Trafalgar (resulting in his death) was the result of orders to destroy a combined Franco-Spanish fleet that was ordered to combine with more Spanish ships at Cartagena and cover an invasion of Britain.

I also wanna know if the rumors of an alleged assassination plot by Thomas Hickey are true?  I also wanna know, did the British and Continental armies have spies? Did any continental army soldiers infiltrate the British army to gather intelligence during the war? ",199,2024-11-14 17:19:26
AskHistorians,"Whether or not he is a good general is a really loaded question and ultimately a matter of opinion.  You can rate a general based on their Strategy, Tactics, or Logistics and come up with different conclusions about whether he was “really that good.” 

Ultimately I would argue that his ability to hold the Continental Army together without any pay for soldiers for the vast majority of the war, with virtually no supplies, when states refused to supply men, arms, supplies, or money, and when many generals had different goals, agendas, and egos is nothing short of a miracle. This alone makes him among the greatest generals in American history, at least. 

Yes Washington did lead from the front Generally speaking. Many of the records we have from people who witnessed him in battle comment on his bravery to the point of having a seeming death wish, particularly when he had to abandon New York and was trying to rally his men. But as far as I am aware he was not actually fighting as say a Benedict Arnold might, but rather observing the field, issuing orders, and rallying men, but most certainly in harms way.

Many of Washington’s major strategic successes are actually tactical losses. For example at the Battles of Long Island, Harlem Heights, White Plains, Brandywine, and Germantown, Washington lost the battle tactically (that is he lost more men and/or retreated from the field) but they were strategic victories in that he escaped with an intact army and lived to continue leading the army.

His poor tactical performance is often blamed on his tendency to over complicate plans. For example he tried to convince his generals to launch an amphibious assault of New York. The famous crossing of the Delaware was also needlessly complicated in 3 prongs almost causing it to fail.

Many of the more famous victories for example Bemis Heights aka Saratoga were won by his rival Gen. Horatio Gates (really his subordinate Benedict Arnold). Washington’s lack of famous victories (prior to Yorktown) led to the Conway Cabal, an effort by some in Congress and the Continental Army to oust Washington as head of the Army and replace him with Gates. 

The chain of command was just like the British army it was modeled after. Washington at the head, with subordinate Major Generals, Brigadier Generals, so on and so forth. The army was also divided into Departments associated with armies, the main ones being the Northern Army - primarily operating in New York after the Siege of Boston ended, the Middle Army- being the Main Army with Washington, and the Southern Army (destroyed at Charleston, and again at Camden). He also had to coordinate with the relevant state armies which his authority over was not always clear. They remained fiercely independent and loathed being controlled by a central authority hence the whole revolution thing, so it required a lot of tact and clever people skills to make it work.

No George Washington becoming King was not hypothetically possible in my opinion simply because of the person he was. Had any of the other generals been in his position, then yes absolutely it would have been possible.

Yes the British and continental armies had spies. Most famous of which would be Washington’s Culper Spy ring made famous by the book Washington’s Spies and the TV show “Turn”. They were both civilian and military elements spying on the British army in NYC. Contrasting that is Major John Andre who led the British efforts, including getting Benedict Arnold to become a traitor, but Andre was ultimately caught and hung by the Americans as a spy. Countless other civilian patriots and loyalists gave information to their respective sides, including women and slaves who had unique access to information because of how society viewed them.

I would say they are more than rumors with respect to Thomas Hickey. We do have a transcript of a trial at which he was convicted and ultimately executed for a plot to assassinate Washington while serving as a member of his Life Guard. Whether that evidence is sufficient to stand up to modern day scrutiny…I’m not so sure. It appears to be based on essentially jailhouse informants testimony.",holtn56,7904,Was George Washington really that good of a general during the revolutionary war?

I’m a cheater- always have been. I could lie. I could tell you about how my dad wasn’t around or some Freudian bullshit about how every girl I ever dated could never match up to my mother, but it wouldn’t be the truth. I didn’t have a hard life and my relationship with my mother is healthy.

I’m just an asshole. But I didn’t deserve this.

“Brian, you’re the best thing that has ever happened to me, but I need just a little more time,” Blythe whispered, her long blond hair falling over her reddening, gorgeous face.

“Yeah, sorry. It’s only been nine months,” I scoffed, “You’re just—” I bit my lip. I’ve never really handled rejection well. It isn’t that my ego is fragile or anything, pride is just hard.  “You’re worth the wait. I have work in the morning.” I brushed her hair out of her face and chastely kissed her soft lips.

I should have just gone home and went to bed, rubbed one out for good measure, but a scorned man goes where his dick and the night will carry him.

On the drive home, I pressed my thumb against my cellphone screen like a worry stone and thought of Shelly. She was a six and a half out of ten on a good day, but she never said no.

The phone rang twice on my end before she picked up. “How soon do you want me over?” Shelly purred. I liked that. No hello, no small talk, and best of all no, ‘I need more time’.

“How about you host tonight? I was in the area. I’m about 5 minutes out.” The thought of Shelly in my bed like old times was a nice one, but I didn’t want to risk anyone seeing her car there. I knew Blythe had no reason to be suspicious, no reason to follow me, but I was careful. I’d always been careful.

Shelly agreed. She always did. I was there right on time. I hesitated just for a second in her driveway. I almost pulled back out, but then I started replaying the shock in Blythe’s eyes when I asked. The way she softened her voice when she told me she wanted to take a little more time. Like she thought my feelings needed sparing. That I’d fall apart and cry or something. Her infantilizing tone was too much.

Pride has a way of really fucking things up and so do I. Less than a half hour later, I wasn’t thinking about that anymore; I was busy getting tangled in the sheets with Shelly.

In the heat of the moment, I felt something sting my back. I tried to swipe it off, not wanting to be distracted from her, but it was starting to burn. As I twisted to get a better smack at my back, I saw Blythe at the window, blond hair floating in the wind and her face pressed hard against the glass.

I scrambled to turn around and claw my way through the tangled sheets. In all my glorious efforts, I only succeeded in falling off of the bed and smacking my cheekbone on the wooden frame on my way down. Shelly squeaked at the sharp smack. Something between a stutter, beatboxing, and a juvenile attempt at profanity fell out of my mouth. I finally untangled myself enough to turn towards the now vacant window. Blythe was gone.

I ran out the front door, stark naked to an empty street. Not even taillights winked in the distance.

“Get back inside! Have you lost your mind? Someone’s going to call the cops!” Shelly’s screams rattled in between my ears. I’m sure they would if she kept it up. I glanced one more time down the empty road and turned back inside.

I didn’t mention Blythe when I tried to explain my sudden interest in streaking, but I did tell her I thought there was someone outside the window. At this point, I was starting to doubt that Blythe had been there at all. Hell, that anyone had been there at all. Maybe it was guilt. Either way, the night was ruined. I didn’t kiss her when I left. I didn’t even look back.

The gravel crunched under my Corolla as it crawled down my street. My heart thumped in time with the rolling tires imagining Blythe waiting in the driveway.  Maybe a brick through my window. Something. But there was no sign of Blythe, her car, nor any vandalism. Lost in thought, I smashed the brake with the nose of my car inches from the garage door. The spot on my back started to tingle.

I jingled my keys as I half-skipped to the entryway. I shook my head and grinned. I’d call Blythe in the morning to be sure, but I was confident at this point that I had made a mistake at Shelly’s. I kicked myself internally. But there’d be another night. There always was.

After a fast shower, I checked my back. Except for a small red dot, there was nothing to blame for the burning. Could it have been an asp? Do spider bites burn? A bee sting? My mind wandered, but I didn’t have any solid answer.

Maybe I should be ashamed to admit it, but as soon as my head hit the pillow, I was asleep. Guilt couldn’t override my exhaustion, and I wasn’t all that sure I felt guilty anyway.

My dreams told another story though. My pupils dilated with such ferocity adjusting to the dim lighting of Blythe’s living room I could feel the stretch in my eyes. Although my chest heaved with effort, I could only whisper her name. She responded with laughter- the tinkle of an amused child. My heart battered in my chest. The pain from the bug bite on my back dialed up to 11; sharp appendages caressed the edges from the inside. I choked on the scream trying to throw itself from my lips. I could feel something soft pushing from my stomach, blooming in my esophagus. I gave a forceful cough and felt a thick, squishy lump fly up from my throat and flop onto my tongue. Gagging, I pulled a clump of Shelly’s hair from my mouth. Long strands straggled up my throat as I removed the mass. All the while Blythe laughed.

I woke up a mess- bloodshot eyes and my stomach in knots. I fumbled my phone and called Blythe. The certainty I’d had from last night was fading. The damn nightmare was playing tricks with my head. Or my guilty conscience. Either way, I needed to know. The phone rang. Once, twice, three times – and she finally picked up. She sounded her usual chipper self.  My voice cracked as I lied. I told her I’d called out from work, that I cared about her too much to leave things the way we had last night. And she ate it. She ate it well. The cramp in my stomach released. We made dinner plans and hung up.

I tried to lay back down, eager to get some restful sleep, but my body wouldn’t comply. The relief I felt wasn’t enough to appease the burning on my back.

I stumbled to the bathroom. Upon further investigation, what was once a small dot had most definitely spread. The center appeared to have crusted over a bit. No matter how I twisted or contorted, it rested solidly between my shoulder blades just out of reach. The crusted head on the mound taunted and begged for the sensual scratch of my fingernails. But there was a bigger problem. My cheek was swollen where I’d smacked it on Shelly’s bed frame the night before, a light purple shadow licking the apple. Another lie I’d need to invent to cover my tracks. It was never the cheating that bothered me. It was the lying. It was the having to remember. It was an irritating inconvenience. 

I pulled out my phone to text an apology to Shelly. Given the giant pain in the ass this all had been, I doubt I’d be seeing her for a while, but I believed in keeping all my bridges intact for the crossing. As an afterthought, I asked if she’d been bitten by anything lately.

As I rotted in bed waiting for a reply, soft dreamless sleep found me.

My eyes thrust open as the lump on my back radiated pain. Both cheeks boasted that just-smacked tingle that teased of a fever. I started to think about the time I’d been playing in a brush pile as a child. A black widow had bitten me and I’d been dog shit sick for a few days. But did it burn?

I checked the time and nearly tripped over myself throwing clothes on to meet Blythe. No word still from Shelly. Maybe my odd behavior had spooked her, but no response at all? Weird. No time to think on it now. I hastily deleted the text thread and shot one to Blythe telling her I was on my way. I wouldn’t normally go to dinner sick, but I needed to see Blythe. I just couldn’t shake that something was off and I needed my mind at ease.  I popped a couple of ibuprofen and headed out the door.

For the first time in 9 months of seeing her, Blythe was late. This shit day was turning out to have plenty of firsts. It had only been five minutes at this point, no big deal. I tried to tell myself that maybe there was traffic. A flat tire. She couldn’t find her keys. Anything other than her standing me up. The next five I started to feel a twinge of rot in the bottom of my stomach. She was outside the window, saw everything, and was standing me up as punishment. My armpits leaked fever-sweat. I was angry. Just as I scooted my seat back to leave, she walked in.

“Sorry! Couldn’t decide on shoes!” She struck a pose with her heel lifted before gliding into her seat. I couldn’t help but chuckle; I was about to lose it over a woman and her shoes.

Blythe was completely herself. Smiling and beautiful. I was trying to keep things light, but I’d started to sweat all over now. The thick kind. The kind that refuses to drip. The kind that reminds you of that kid in third grade who spat on you on the bus and it globbed on your cheek. Oh, the kids sucked air and one dared you to do something, but you wore that glob like a coward’s badge and did nothing. You sat there with your head down until your stop, staring at the congealed mess on your sleeve, and you-

“You look like shit, are you alright?” Blythe’s eyebrow was hiked higher than a whore’s skirt and I cackled right there at the table. My stomach heaved. I wasn’t alright. We both knew it. But only one of us knew why.

She settled the tab and invited me over to her place to take care of me. I know I didn’t deserve it, but I needed it. Even the dim lights in the restaurant were starting to bother my eyes.

This is where things get a little fuzzy. I remember most of the drive. I remember seeing Blythe’s door, and then I remember waking up on her couch with the phone to my ear, still ringing.

I shook my pounding head and answered. “Brian Pond? This is Detective Waysome,” he sucked air but didn’t wait for confirmation, “We’re investigating the disappearance of Shelly Moore. She was reported missing by some friends five days ago. It looks like the last call on her log was to your number in the area of 4 AM that morning. Do you have some time?”

My eyes flew open fully now. “I haven’t seen her. Five days? I’m sorry I haven’t been feeling well,” my pitch rose as my vocal cords stretched and seized. “I have to go, but I’ll call you. I’ll call you.” His voice had begun to leak out of the speaker but I couldn’t listen anymore. I jammed my finger repeatedly on ‘end call’.

I had been with Shelly last night, so how had she been missing for five days? None of this made sense. There was no way I’d been asleep on this couch for days. Blythe would have taken me to the hospital, right? I needed answers, and if the sharp stabbing behind my eyes was any indication, possibly an ambulance.

The lining of my brain squeezed as I called for Blythe. The reverberation of my voice off the high ceilings followed by the somber silence lifted the hairs on the back of my neck. I tried to stand, but my legs buckled under my weight. My body sagged. On my second attempt, I managed to stumble down the hall to Blythe’s room. I slid my hand against the wall to guide me as I walked, still not trusting my legs not to crumble under the weight of the raging fever. The patterns on the floor swirled under my feet with each step. I had to be hallucinating. My heart rate hiked, and I called for Blythe again. Still only silence.

Near panicked, I pushed through Blythe’s door. Shelly was sitting on the bed undressed and unmoving, as Blythe carved the last bit of a symbol on her chest. Candles on every surface illuminated the room.  My dry, swollen throat wouldn’t allow me to scream. A skull with grey chunks of meat still attached sat in the center of an altar on the dresser. The walls were covered in symbols. My breath hiked in my chest as I noted that a few matched those carved onto Shelly.

Blythe brushed Shelly’s hair back from her face and tucked it behind her ear, her smile slowly melting into a frown. This had to be a hallucination, a fever dream, something. My brain was cracking and aching trying to comprehend the scene unfolding before me. My throat finally unlocked, and I whispered Blythe’s name. She finally turned to me standing in the doorway and her smile returned. She gently patted a spot on the bed twice beside Shelly, gesturing for me to sit. I didn’t want to, I wanted nothing more than to run, but my legs operated but my legs weren’t my own. They marched themselves to the edge of the bed and I sat. Blythe looked at me with the eyes of a mother regarding their toddler they’d caught twirling their fingers in the toilet water for the third time in a day. Disappointed, slightly disgusted, but still with love. Vomit inched from my stomach towards my throat. I was terrified.

“Let’s start being honest with each other, okay Brian?” She tilted her head while her eyes bore into me; a small smirk quivered on her lips. “I know about Shelly. I saw everything. I can’t even begin to tell you how disappointed I am,” She paused for a second as she sucked in a big breath, her face relaxed and returned her familiar beauty. “I sent a little friend home with you to see what you’d do. To see if things were worth salvaging. And boy was I sorely disappointed!” She clicked her tongue and her eyes bulged. “You slept well considering what was growing inside of you, and then texted her, right after you made plans to see me? Not cool Brian. Not cool at all.”

Blythe was pacing back and forth in front of her bed, erratically throwing her hands around as she spoke. I kept my face as emotionless as possible and listened. I was terrified to say the wrong thing to her. The longer she spoke, the more her eyes began to bulge in and out like a fucked up cuckoo clock; spit flew from her mouth with every accusation. The smell of burning hair wafted across the room. My eyes flicked to the alter where a small clump of hair singed from a nearby candle. Blythe’s grin stretched, showing all her teeth. I imagined her biting into chunks of my skin and swallowing like a crazed cannibal, making sure I’d never be able to leave her. Fear was eating the small remnants of the rational part of my brain that was left. Her bulging eyes now glittered with interest. Like she could see inside of me. Like she knew. “Right, that. I guess you’re not the only one keeping secrets Brian, but I told you I needed more time! But before we get into any of that, let me help you with your back.”

Blythe danced her way behind the bed, humming. The creaking of the springs in the mattress as she crawled towards me twisted my stomach. She slid her legs on either side of my body and twirled her finger gently in circles around the monstrosity on my back. She leaned in close, her hot breath against my back and lips brushing me in a way that bordered erotic as she whispered. My legs still wouldn’t work to run. When the whispering stopped, she ran her hot tongue across the lump. As the saliva cooled, something began to pulse under the surface of my skin, pushing and stretching its way out. “Yes! You’re doing such a good job!” Blythe squealed, “What a good girl! Come meet my friends!”

There was a flat pop as the pain in my back peaked and then subsided. My body crumbled forward as I wept from the pain. I felt flaps of skin flutter as the thing set two fuzzy feet onto either side of the wound and heaved itself out of my back. It scurried up to my shoulder and twitched as it hesitantly hovered its furry, bloody leg at the entrance to my ear. “You won’t fit in there anymore silly! You’ve gotten too big!” Blythe cooed. I shivered as it twitched once more before jumping onto Shelly. Blythe unwrapped her legs around me, clapping gleefully as she made her way back around the bed to watch.

I knew what it was the second I felt its legs on me but admitting it while it crawled out of my skin would have taken me past the point of insanity. Now that I could see it on Shelly, I couldn’t deny myself the truth anymore; it was a spider. A huge god damn spider. It clamped its legs around Shelly’s head with its abdomen pressed hard against her face. I had no knowledge of nor experience with giant spiders, but my brain screamed that it was eating her. I couldn’t help it, I puked and sobbed. 

The last bit of hope that clung to all of this being a fever dream died as a low, muffled, moan leaked from Shelly’s mouth underneath the spider’s fat body. Blythe grabbed a jar off the altar and threw it at my head, narrowly missing. The jar shattered as it smashed behind me. A combination of ammonia and rot replaced the singed hair smell. The symbol behind me smeared as the foul liquid wept down the wall. “Don’t you dare fucking cry for her Brian! She’s a whore!” Blythe sobbed as she screamed. As more of the symbols smeared behind us, I felt a pressure release from my legs. I could wiggle my toes! Blythe was wailing with her hands ripping at her hair. The spider didn’t seem bothered by the noise, still pulsing and shivering against Shelly’s moaning face.

Blythe had completely lost it. If I thought I was terrified before, I lack the words to describe what I felt at that moment. There was no doubt in my mind- Blythe was going to kill me. My eyes darted, looking for a weapon. Finally, they landed on a snow globe I’d bought Blythe a month ago on our trip to New York. Sleeping with Blythe in the hotel was where the idea of living together was born. Where I had decided I didn’t want to spend any more nights without her in my arms. Where this whole mess started. I snatched the globe from its place on the stand and slammed it against Blythe’s head as hard as I could.

Blythe dropped to the floor. The room fell silent except for Shelly’s ever-softening moans. I couldn’t be sure Blythe wasn’t faking, but I couldn’t bring myself to check. I needed to get out of there as fast as possible, for my sanity more than my safety.

I slammed the door behind me to trap the spider inside and ran to the garage. I wanted nothing more than to run, but I had to be sure the spider was dead. I couldn’t end up like Shelly. I grabbed the gas canister for the mower and with a fresh wave of nausea, headed back into the house.

I threw gas on the curtains before splattering a trail to Blythe’s bedroom door. Shelly didn’t deserve to die here, but as far as I knew, she was gone the second the spider suctioned itself to her face. I grabbed the matches by the fireplace, lit one, and threw it onto the curtain before finally running out the door and tasting the night air.

I tripped over my feet before landing on the lawn. Blood loss and shock were whispering to stay. To let this soft grass be home. I was so tired. But images of Shelly sitting naked, the life being sucked out of her broke me of giving up and adrenaline surged once more. I shakily pulled myself up and into my car.

I drove for two hours straight before my gas light dinged. I booked the closest no-contact hotel room and arrived on fumes. I was covered in sweat, puke, and blood. The plan, however poor, was to clean up, rest only for an hour, refill my car, and keep driving- put as much distance as possible between everything that had happened and myself. I wanted so badly to believe I had made all of it up. That Shelly was fine and not texting me back because I had made an ass out of myself. That I had slept through the dinner with Blythe. That I was still asleep, dreaming the most fucked up fever dream I’d ever had in my life. But the pain from the gaping hole in my back wouldn’t let me pretend.

I’m not ashamed to admit I cried in the shower until the lines in my hands were peaks and valleys. I tore up the bedsheets to make a makeshift bandage for my back. It looks disgusting, but I can’t get help. I can’t even begin to think of a story I could tell the hospital that would explain my injuries. Or if the police were looking for me for Shelly. Or the fire. Or Blythe.

Even exhaustion hasn’t blessed me with sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I picture Shelly naked with symbols carved all over her body, covered in webs. The spider on her face, pulsing and shaking in ecstasy with hundreds of babies on its back. I should have stood on the lawn and watched the whole house burn. Just to be sure.

I went out to the car and got my work laptop to search for news articles on the fire I started at Blythe’s, but the information was limited. As of the last time I searched, they hadn’t reported any bodies. It’s being referred to as an accidental fire.

My mind was still swimming, so I started to write. I need someone to know my story. I need them to know that I -never meant for this to happen. Even after almost a year of seeing Blythe- loving her, I had no idea she was into anything like this. She never once acted unstable in the entire relationship. I never meant to hurt Shelly. She didn’t deserve to be caught up in this mess, and I shouldn’t have left her.

For the last 10 minutes, I’ve heard something softly tapping at my hotel door. Fear has a way of filling in the gaps. My brain tells me the feet are soft but strong. Furry and many. I won’t get up and I won’t look. I’ve seen enough. There’s a storm coming. I can hear Blythe’s tinkering laughter riding on the winds. The giggling of a child who knows they’re about to pull a very naughty trick.",108,2024-11-14 22:00:31
nosleep,Hell hath no fury like a woman you fucked around on.,anubis_cheerleader,190715,I Think I Need To Break Up With My Girlfriend,"Before anyone feels the need to state the obvious, I know I’m not a good person.

I’m a cheater- always have been. I could lie. I could tell you about how my dad wasn’t around or some Freudian bullshit about how every girl I ever dated could never match up to my mother, but it wouldn’t be the truth. I didn’t have a hard life and my relationship with my mother is healthy.

I’m just an asshole. But I didn’t deserve this.

“Brian, you’re the best thing that has ever happened to me, but I need just a little more time,” Blythe whispered, her long blond hair falling over her reddening, gorgeous face.

“Yeah, sorry. It’s only been nine months,” I scoffed, “You’re just—” I bit my lip. I’ve never really handled rejection well. It isn’t that my ego is fragile or anything, pride is just hard.  “You’re worth the wait. I have work in the morning.” I brushed her hair out of her face and chastely kissed her soft lips.

I should have just gone home and went to bed, rubbed one out for good measure, but a scorned man goes where his dick and the night will carry him.

On the drive home, I pressed my thumb against my cellphone screen like a worry stone and thought of Shelly. She was a six and a half out of ten on a good day, but she never said no.

The phone rang twice on my end before she picked up. “How soon do you want me over?” Shelly purred. I liked that. No hello, no small talk, and best of all no, ‘I need more time’.

“How about you host tonight? I was in the area. I’m about 5 minutes out.” The thought of Shelly in my bed like old times was a nice one, but I didn’t want to risk anyone seeing her car there. I knew Blythe had no reason to be suspicious, no reason to follow me, but I was careful. I’d always been careful.

Shelly agreed. She always did. I was there right on time. I hesitated just for a second in her driveway. I almost pulled back out, but then I started replaying the shock in Blythe’s eyes when I asked. The way she softened her voice when she told me she wanted to take a little more time. Like she thought my feelings needed sparing. That I’d fall apart and cry or something. Her infantilizing tone was too much.

Pride has a way of really fucking things up and so do I. Less than a half hour later, I wasn’t thinking about that anymore; I was busy getting tangled in the sheets with Shelly.

In the heat of the moment, I felt something sting my back. I tried to swipe it off, not wanting to be distracted from her, but it was starting to burn. As I twisted to get a better smack at my back, I saw Blythe at the window, blond hair floating in the wind and her face pressed hard against the glass.

I scrambled to turn around and claw my way through the tangled sheets. In all my glorious efforts, I only succeeded in falling off of the bed and smacking my cheekbone on the wooden frame on my way down. Shelly squeaked at the sharp smack. Something between a stutter, beatboxing, and a juvenile attempt at profanity fell out of my mouth. I finally untangled myself enough to turn towards the now vacant window. Blythe was gone.

I ran out the front door, stark naked to an empty street. Not even taillights winked in the distance.

“Get back inside! Have you lost your mind? Someone’s going to call the cops!” Shelly’s screams rattled in between my ears. I’m sure they would if she kept it up. I glanced one more time down the empty road and turned back inside.

I didn’t mention Blythe when I tried to explain my sudden interest in streaking, but I did tell her I thought there was someone outside the window.

I guess you’re not the only one keeping secrets Brian, but I told you I needed more time! But before we get into any of that, let me help you with your back.”

Blythe danced her way behind the bed, humming. The creaking of the springs in the mattress as she crawled towards me twisted my stomach. She slid her legs on either side of my body and twirled her finger gently in circles around the monstrosity on my back. She leaned in close, her hot breath against my back and lips brushing me in a way that bordered erotic as she whispered. My legs still wouldn’t work to run. When the whispering stopped, she ran her hot tongue across the lump. As the saliva cooled, something began to pulse under the surface of my skin, pushing and stretching its way out. “Yes! You’re doing such a good job!” Blythe squealed, “What a good girl! Come meet my friends!”

There was a flat pop as the pain in my back peaked and then subsided. My body crumbled forward as I wept from the pain. I felt flaps of skin flutter as the thing set two fuzzy feet onto either side of the wound and heaved itself out of my back. It scurried up to my shoulder and twitched as it hesitantly hovered its furry, bloody leg at the entrance to my ear. “You won’t fit in there anymore silly! You’ve gotten too big!” Blythe cooed. I shivered as it twitched once more before jumping onto Shelly. Blythe unwrapped her legs around me, clapping gleefully as she made her way back around the bed to watch.

I knew what it was the second I felt its legs on me but admitting it while it crawled out of my skin would have taken me past the point of insanity. Now that I could see it on Shelly, I couldn’t deny myself the truth anymore; it was a spider. A huge god damn spider. It clamped its legs around Shelly’s head with its abdomen pressed hard against her face. I had no knowledge of nor experience with giant spiders, but my brain screamed that it was eating her. I couldn’t help it, I puked and sobbed. 

The last bit of hope that clung to all of this being a fever dream died as a low, muffled, moan leaked from Shelly’s mouth underneath the spider’s fat body. Blythe grabbed a jar off the altar and threw it at my head, narrowly missing. The jar shattered as it smashed behind me. A combination of ammonia and rot replaced the singed hair smell. The symbol behind me smeared as the foul liquid wept down the wall. “Don’t you dare fucking cry for her Brian! She’s a whore!” Blythe sobbed as she screamed. As more of the symbols smeared behind us, I felt a pressure release from my legs. I could wiggle my toes! Blythe was wailing with her hands ripping at her hair. The spider didn’t seem bothered by the noise, still pulsing and shivering against Shelly’s moaning face.

Blythe had completely lost it. If I thought I was terrified before, I lack the words to describe what I felt at that moment. There was no doubt in my mind- Blythe was going to kill me. My eyes darted, looking for a weapon. Finally, they landed on a snow globe I’d bought Blythe a month ago on our trip to New York. Sleeping with Blythe in the hotel was where the idea of living together was born. Where I had decided I didn’t want to spend any more nights without her in my arms. Where this whole mess started. I snatched the globe from its place on the stand and slammed it against Blythe’s head as hard as I could.

Blythe dropped to the floor. The room fell silent except for Shelly’s ever-softening moans. I couldn’t be sure Blythe wasn’t faking, but I couldn’t bring myself to check. I needed to get out of there as fast as possible, for my sanity more than my safety.

I slammed the door behind me to trap the spider inside and ran to the garage. I wanted nothing more than to run, but I had to be sure the spider was dead. I couldn’t end up like Shelly. I grabbed the gas canister for the mower and with a fresh wave of nausea, headed back into the house.

I threw gas on the curtains before splattering a trail to Blythe’s bedroom door. Shelly didn’t deserve to die here, but as far as I knew, she was gone the second the spider suctioned itself to her face. I grabbed the matches by the fireplace, lit one, and threw it onto the curtain before finally running out the door and tasting the night air.

I tripped over my feet before landing on the lawn. Blood loss and shock were whispering to stay. To let this soft grass be home. I was so tired. But images of Shelly sitting naked, the life being sucked out of her broke me of giving up and adrenaline surged once more. I shakily pulled myself up and into my car.

I drove for two hours straight before my gas light dinged. I booked the closest no-contact hotel room and arrived on fumes. I was covered in sweat, puke, and blood. The plan, however poor, was to clean up, rest only for an hour, refill my car, and keep driving- put as much distance as possible between everything that had happened and myself. I wanted so badly to believe I had made all of it up. That Shelly was fine and not texting me back because I had made an ass out of myself. That I had slept through the dinner with Blythe. That I was still asleep, dreaming the most fucked up fever dream I’d ever had in my life. But the pain from the gaping hole in my back wouldn’t let me pretend.

I’m not ashamed to admit I cried in the shower until the lines in my hands were peaks and valleys. I tore up the bedsheets to make a makeshift bandage for my back. It looks disgusting, but I can’t get help. I can’t even begin to think of a story I could tell the hospital that would explain my injuries. Or if the police were looking for me for Shelly. Or the fire. Or Blythe.

Even exhaustion hasn’t blessed me with sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I picture Shelly naked with symbols carved all over her body, covered in webs. The spider on her face, pulsing and shaking in ecstasy with hundreds of babies on its back. I should have stood on the lawn and watched the whole house burn. Just to be sure.

I went out to the car and got my work laptop to search for news articles on the fire I started at Blythe’s, but the information was limited. As of the last time I searched, they hadn’t reported any bodies. It’s being referred to as an accidental fire.

My mind was still swimming, so I started to write. I need someone to know my story. I need them to know that I -never meant for this to happen. Even after almost a year of seeing Blythe- loving her, I had no idea she was into anything like this. She never once acted unstable in the entire relationship. I never meant to hurt Shelly. She didn’t deserve to be caught up in this mess, and I shouldn’t have left her.

For the last 10 minutes, I’ve heard something softly tapping at my hotel door. Fear has a way of filling in the gaps. My brain tells me the feet are soft but strong. Furry and many. I won’t get up and I won’t look. I’ve seen enough. There’s a storm coming. I can hear Blythe’s tinkering laughter riding on the winds. The giggling of a child who knows they’re about to pull a very naughty trick.",108,2024-11-14 21:59:12
nosleep,"Man, I really hope you also took your cat with you!",WeirdGreen7,1132,My wife just admitted that she's an alcoholic. And it doesn't stop there...,"“I think I need to go to rehab.”

My heart dropped when I heard that. It came out of nowhere. The woman I was married to - and living with - had been struggling in the throes of addiction, and I was none the wiser? I had never felt so taken aback. 

“Carrie, what do you mean? I don’t understand where this is coming from,” I said, gingerly taking her hand in mine. 

“Exactly what I said. I need help, John. I’ve been drinking again. Like, a lot.” 

My mouth involuntarily fell open. Carrie had admitted to having alcohol dependency after graduating from college, but I had always been under the impression that she’d nipped it in the bud. 

“Honey… How long has this been going on? I never would have guessed if you hadn’t told me,” I replied, taking a step back. 

“I know,” she said, tears welling in her eyes. “It’s been six months. I’ve been drinking vodka to hide the smell. That nightly glass of wine… it’s actually cranberry juice and Smirnoff. I’ve been throwing the empty bottles in the dumpster behind my work so you wouldn’t catch on. I’m sorry that I kept this from you, I really am. I just couldn’t bear the thought of losing you over it.” Carrie broke down, tears streaking down her cheeks. 

“Hey, hey. I would *never* leave you over something like that. You are the love of my life. We’ll get through this together,” I reassured her, gently rubbing her back. 

“Really? That makes me so happy to hear.” She wrapped her arms around me, and she stayed there for a long time, sobbing into my shirt. “Thank you for being so accepting. I needed that,” Carrie said, finally pulling away. 

“That’s what I’m here for. I’ll support you no matter what - but there’s something that I need to know.”

“Anything for you.” 

“I need you to be honest with me. Is that all you’re hiding?” 

Her eyes widened, and I could see the wheels turning in her head. “No, this was it. There’s nothing else going on.” 

“Carrie. Don’t lie to me. We’ve been married for thirteen years. I know when you’re not telling the truth.” 

“Fine. I’ve been going to a support group. You know, for alcoholics.” 

My brows furrowed. “Okay? And why did you feel the need to keep that from me?” 

“Because it’s not working. This was a lot to get off my chest. I don’t want to talk about it anymore.” 

“Alright. But we’re going to revisit this later.” 

She nodded, before darting into our room and locking the door. I didn’t know what she was playing at, but I knew that my wife wasn’t telling the truth. Not all of it, at least. And I was determined to find out what she was hiding. 

Now, I wish I would have just left her alone. 

Carrie didn’t check herself into rehab right away. She said that she had to “make some preparations” before being admitted. No problem there. What *was* an issue was the late nights that she would spend out with people she claimed to be friends, or coworkers, or family. I knew better. 

Each time Carrie would tell me that she was coming home late, I’d check her location. She’s not the best with technology, so I’d wager a guess that she forgot that she shared it with me. And I used that to my advantage. 

Whenever my wife made up an excuse not to come home, her phone said that she was always at one spot - the abandoned church on the outskirts of town. So I did what any suspicious husband would do. I tried to catch her in the act. 

“Look man, I don’t know if this is the best idea,” my coworker, Jeremy, said as I neared the parking lot. 

“Oh yeah? Well, what would you do in this situation?” 

“I’d probably just, like, call the cops or something.” 

“Really? And tell them what? That my wife might be boinking some random dude in an empty church? They’d be more likely to write *me* a ticket for filing a false report.” 

“Whatever man, I tried to warn you. Good luck.” And with that, the line went dead. 

“Thanks, I guess,” I grumbled, slapping the car in park and pocketing my phone. 

I glanced up at the run-down building before me, steeling myself for what I was about to do. The church was even creepier in person. A fire had left it completely charred, evidenced by the imprints left around the shattered windows. Vines snaked along the exterior, lending to the place’s eerie ambience. I *really* didn’t want to have to go in there, but I knew that I didn’t have any other choice. 

After reassuring myself in the rearview mirror for what must have been at least ten minutes, I finally gathered the courage to go inside. I crept up to the entrance, my eyes darting frantically around the parking lot. I felt like I was doing something wrong. Like one misteps would have the local police force swarming me in an instant. 

I quietly pushed open the front door, breathing a sigh of relief when it didn’t creak. The church was dark, but I could see a faint light emitting from one of the rooms toward the back. My heart jackhammered in my chest. Was I really doing this? What if Carrie found out? It would break her. 

No. She wasn’t being honest with me, and I had to know why. I couldn’t afford to turn and run. Not after making it so far. 

I pressed forward, following a path that had been cleared through the debris. Aside from that, the interior looked just as I imagine it had the day of the fire. Everything had been burnt to a crisp, save for a marble statue of the Virgin Mary near what used to be a stained glass window. I shuddered when I saw it. It felt as if its eyes were following me around the room, casting judgment on me. 

After a painstakingly long time trying to remain silent, I finally made it to the source of the light. I cautiously peeked my head around the corner to what I assumed was someone’s hollowed out office. What I saw still haunts me to this day. 

Carrie, along with about four other pale figures in hooded robes were gathered around a man’s flayed corpse. His organs had been carved out, and the group was chanting in an unintelligible language. Beneath the body lay what appeared to be a pentagram. 

I ducked out of view, clutching my chest and trying to stifle my breathing. This couldn’t be happening. I began to question everything I knew about my wife. I couldn’t believe what I had just seen. 

I did the only logical thing I could do at that moment - I hightailed it out of there. I crept out of the church as quickly as I could without alerting any of those lunatics, and I raced home, going well over the speed limit. 

Once I arrived back at the house, I tried my best to steady myself. Hot tears stung my eyes as I pulled out my phone. I didn’t want to do it, but I knew that I had to. I steeled my resolve, and I called the police on my wife. 

“Hello, 9-1-1. What is your emergency?” 

“I th-think I just saw a cult ritual. There was this guy, and he was-” I nearly vomited just recanting the gruesome scene, but I managed to keep it down. “The man, he was… dead. Please, you have to send someone. It was at the old church on Fifth Avenue.” 

“Alright sir, stay calm. I’m sending a squad car. Are you in the vicinity?” 

“What? N-no, I’m safe. I-” 

My eyes grew wide, and for a moment, I thought that I might pass out. Just then, I received a text from Carrie. My breathing shallowed as I opened it. 

There was a picture. One of *my* car sitting in the church parking lot. It was followed by a close-up of me in the driver’s seat. My heart thumped wildly in my chest as a text bubble appeared. 

*We need to talk. If you tell ANYONE about this, you’ll be next.* 

“Hello? Sir, are you still on the line?” the operator asked, pulling me out of it. “What did the man look like?” 

“Uh… I’m not sure. I’m sorry, but I have to go.” I hung up before she had a chance to protest. 

I didn’t waste any time. I packed what I could in the few precious minutes that I had, and I left. I have a feeling that I just messed with some *very* powerful people. I’m going to get as far away from that town as possible, no matter the cost. I’m not sure what’s next for me.  

All I know is that I don’t want to end up like that man with his chest open for all to see, lying on the floor of an [abandoned church.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/)",390,2024-11-14 13:22:03

nosleep,"Your poor parents. Maybe you can stab the baddie with an iron poker or something. Sometimes, the best defense is a good offense.",GiantLizardsInc,15511,I Found My Little Sister's Diary. I Wish I Hadn't.,"My little sister, Emily, always loved keeping a diary. She had stacks of them, pastel covers with little locks, each one filled with messy handwriting and stickers. She used to guard them fiercely, threatening to tell on me if I so much as looked at them.

But Emily passed away three months ago.

She was only eleven. A freak accident at the lake—she fell in, hit her head on a rock, and drowned before anyone could get to her. The funeral was unbearable, and afterward, I couldn’t bring myself to touch her things. Her room remained untouched, like a shrine to the girl she used to be.

But last week, Mom asked me to start sorting through her belongings. I found her latest diary in the bottom drawer of her desk. It was unlocked.

I thought reading it might bring me some closure. I thought it would help me feel close to her again.

I was wrong

The first few entries were normal.

“Today we had pizza for dinner. I took two slices before Joey could get them all! He got mad, but I don’t care.”

That made me smile. Emily always loved teasing me. The next few pages were full of harmless ramblings—complaints about school, doodles of flowers and stars, lists of her favorite songs.

But then, about halfway through, the tone started to change.

“I saw the man again today. He was standing in the backyard, watching me through the window. I told Mom, but she said I was imagining things. He’s always there, though. I can feel him.”

The man?

I paused, flipping back through the earlier entries. No mention of him before. Maybe it was just Emily’s overactive imagination. She’d always been a little jumpy, a little too eager to believe in monsters under the bed.

I kept reading

“The man came closer last night. He tapped on my window. He didn’t say anything, just smiled at me. His teeth are so big. I wanted to scream, but I was too scared.”

I felt a chill run down my spine. Emily’s handwriting got messier with each entry, her words more frantic.

“He comes inside now. He stands at the foot of my bed while I pretend to sleep. He whispers my name. He says he’s waiting.”

Waiting for what?


I flipped to the last few pages, my heart pounding.

“Joey doesn’t see him. No one does. He told me not to tell. He said they wouldn’t believe me. He said I belong to him now.”

I stopped reading. My hands were shaking. This had to be some kind of prank, a made-up story Emily wrote to scare me. But the way she described it, the fear in her words—it felt real.

Too real.

That night, I couldn’t stop thinking about the diary. I couldn’t shake the image of Emily, lying in bed, too terrified to scream while some stranger stood over her. I barely slept.

When I finally drifted off, I dreamed about her. She was standing at the edge of the lake, staring at me with wide, unblinking eyes. Her lips moved, but no sound came out.

When I woke up, I was drenched in sweat.

And there was mud on my shoes.

I told myself it was nothing. Maybe I’d gone outside to clear my head and didn’t remember. But the next day, I found a page from Emily’s diary lying on my desk.

I hadn’t brought the diary upstairs.

The page wasn’t one I’d read before.

“He says Joey will come next. He says Joey will join me soon.”

My blood turned to ice.

That night, I locked my bedroom door. I tried to convince myself it was all in my head, that grief was playing tricks on me. But as I lay there, staring at the ceiling, I heard it.

A tap.

Tap.

Tap.

On my window.

I didn’t want to look. I couldn’t. But something made me turn my head.

He was there.

A man, tall and thin, his face pale and stretched like wax. He smiled at me, baring rows of jagged teeth, and pressed a single finger to his lips.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe.

When I woke up, it was morning.

The window was locked. No sign of anyone outside. I almost convinced myself it was a dream, until I went downstairs and found another page from Emily’s diary on the kitchen table.

“He says it’s time. He says Joey belongs to him now.”

I haven’t slept since. I haven’t left the house. I keep hearing taps at the windows, whispers in the dark. Last night, I found muddy footprints leading from the lake to my bedroom door.

I think I understand now.

Emily didn’t fall.

She didn’t hit her head.

He took her.

And now, he’s coming for me.

nosleep,Wow.  You took us with you.  Amazing storytelling!,FionaTheElf,25718,"I was digging through old archives, looking for old Civil War documents, and came across something I thought I would never find.","I am a very big Civil War buff I like trying to find old documents scouring through libraries to see if there’s anything I can learn that I can’t find online through old journals or note books and the other day I was digging through the back at the wilderness branch library in Orange County, Virginia when I came across an old notebook tucked away that looks like it hasn’t been moved in many years I decide to take it off the shelf sit down and read it and afterwards I knew I had to translate everything into my notes and post it for you all here is what I found



I never thought I’d die in the rain. I imagined an end under a hot Southern sun, maybe at the edge of a cannon’s blast or in a frenzied charge across an open field. But there I was, lying face-down in a puddle, soaked from the relentless downpour that had drenched the forest for days.

My name’s Corporal Jesse Langston, 14th Mississippi Infantry. The year was 1864, and I was in the middle of the hell they call the Battle of the Wilderness. Fires raged through the woods around us, licking up trees and the wounded alike. The smoke choked the air, thick with the coppery scent of blood. I’d seen enough horrors to last a lifetime, and that night, I reckoned it might end right there.

But then, as the smoke closed in, my vision blurred, the pain in my leg faded, and my eyelids grew heavy. I figured that was it—my last breath, my final sleep.

When I woke up, the first thing I noticed was the heat. The Southern woods were stifling, but this was different. The air was so thick with humidity, I felt like I was breathing through a wet cloth. The smell was different, too—sweet and rotten, like flowers left too long in the sun. And the sound… strange animals called out, and the underbrush rustled with life. It was like nothing I’d ever heard before.

I sat up, disoriented. The forest around me wasn’t right. The trees weren’t the familiar oaks and pines of Virginia; they were enormous, wild-looking things with strange, waxy leaves and vines that hung like curtains. I glanced down at my uniform, caked with mud, but then I looked at my hands—there was a rifle in them, all right, but it wasn’t mine. This weapon was… sleek, black, strange. No musket I’d ever seen.

I was in the wrong place, maybe even the wrong time, though I couldn’t let myself believe that just yet. I stumbled forward, feeling the weight of a pack on my back that didn’t belong to me. I’d fought long and hard in the war, seen horrors enough to make any man question his sanity, but this… this was something else.

Suddenly, a burst of sound erupted through the jungle, like a thunderclap but sharper, almost metallic. I hit the ground, instinctively gripping the strange weapon in my hands. My heart was pounding as I lay there, trying to process everything.

Then, out of the shadows, I saw them: men in olive green uniforms, faces streaked with dirt and exhaustion, weaving through the trees. But their gear was strange, their helmets rounded, their packs stuffed with things I couldn’t recognize. They were dressed as soldiers, but not in any uniform I’d ever seen.

“Hey!” I called out, barely managing a croak. My throat was bone-dry.

One of them froze, his eyes scanning the jungle. He raised his weapon, and his gaze landed on me, confusion flickering across his face. “Who the hell are you?” he shouted, a thick accent that I could barely understand.

“I… I don’t rightly know,” I stammered, looking down at my muddied, Confederate-gray trousers, my boots still caked with Virginia clay. “Where… where am I?”

“You’re in Vietnam, buddy,” he replied, keeping his weapon trained on me. “Now who the hell are you?”

“Corporal Jesse Langston, Mississippi Infantry,” I said automatically, though the words felt hollow, meaningless.

The soldier frowned, looking back at the others. “Mississippi Infantry? What kind of joke is this?”

I didn’t have any answers for him, or for myself. I felt like a ghost, wandering through some strange afterlife. The soldier lowered his rifle, his face softening with a mixture of pity and fear.

“You’re coming with us, all right?” he said. “We’ll figure out what to do with you later.”

I nodded numbly, following them through the thick foliage. I tried to make sense of my surroundings, but nothing felt real. The forest seemed alive in a way I couldn’t understand, with insects buzzing louder than gunfire and plants that looked like they could swallow a man whole.

As we walked, the soldiers whispered to each other, throwing glances back at me. I couldn’t blame them. I was a relic, a piece of a different world that didn’t belong here.

Hours passed, maybe days. The jungle around us grew denser, the air hotter. Every sound made me jump—the distant cries, the hum of something overhead that made the trees shudder. At some point, I realized we were being followed.

The soldiers moved fast, silent as shadows, and I struggled to keep up. My legs ached, and my heart raced, but then I heard it: a rustling in the bushes, a whisper of movement. Before I knew it, there was a crack of gunfire, sharper and deadlier than anything I’d heard before.

I dove into the mud as bullets tore through the air, splitting trees and sending splinters flying. The soldiers returned fire with rapid bursts, their strange weapons lighting up the darkness. I gripped my rifle, feeling the cool metal under my fingers, and instinct took over.

I fired, though I couldn’t see the enemy. The soldier beside me shouted something I didn’t understand, but his voice was drowned out by the chaos around us. It felt like the war all over again, the same violence, the same desperation.

When the shooting stopped, the jungle fell silent, save for the labored breathing of the soldiers around me. I looked down at my hands, trembling, covered in mud and blood that wasn’t mine. It felt like I’d been thrown back into the same nightmare, only now it was dressed in different colors, new sounds, new faces.

The soldier who had first spoken to me—who I now knew as “Jack”—looked at me with something like understanding. “You’re not supposed to be here, are you?”

“No,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “I don’t… I don’t know where here is.”

Jack put a hand on my shoulder, a strange look in his eyes. “You and me both, Langston. None of us belong here.”

We trudged through the jungle until dawn, the oppressive heat giving way to a dim light that crept through the trees. I kept my eyes on the horizon, hoping for some sign that this was all just a dream. But the jungle kept going, stretching endlessly in every direction.

By the time we made it to their camp, I knew one thing for certain: I was trapped in a different war, one I could barely comprehend. But it was a war all the same, and I was a soldier.

And in war, the only way out is through. After making it back to camp I decided to go back to sleep. Maybe this was some all weird dream maybe once I woke up everything would be back to normal or I could have some kind of sense and understanding about what is happening.

When I opened my eyes again, the dense jungle canopy was gone. In its place was a canvas ceiling, stained and sagging with rainwater that had pooled on top. The sounds of insects and distant gunfire were replaced by low moans, quiet sobs, and the clinking of surgical tools.

I was back in the Civil War.

My head felt thick, like I was pushing through a fog that wouldn’t clear. I sat up, groaning as pain shot through my leg, and looked around. Rows of cots stretched out around me, filled with wounded men. The tent was dim, lit only by a few oil lamps that flickered and threw shadows across the makeshift hospital.

A nurse appeared at my side, her expression weary but kind. “Easy now, soldier,” she said, gently pressing me back down. “You’ve been through quite the ordeal.”

I stared at her, still dazed. Her face was soft and familiar, a world away from the hardened, grim soldiers I’d walked alongside in that strange jungle. My mind spun, struggling to grasp what was real.

“Where… where am I?” I managed to croak.

“You’re back with the 14th, Corporal Langston,” she said, a soft Southern drawl in her voice. “You were found unconscious in the Wilderness, just outside of Spotsylvania. You’re lucky to be alive.”

The Wilderness. Spotsylvania. The words felt familiar, like pieces of a dream I’d half-forgotten. But then images of the jungle returned—the strange soldiers, the foreign weapons, the terrifying roar of the unknown battle. It had felt so real. I could still feel the weight of that sleek, black rifle in my hands.

“Vietnam,” I muttered, more to myself than to her.

The nurse’s brow furrowed. “Vietnam?” she repeated, looking at me with a mix of confusion and concern.

“It’s… nothing,” I stammered, forcing myself to focus on the tent, the familiar scents of blood and sweat and antiseptic. Everything around me felt vivid and solid, but the memories of the jungle clung to me, like they’d seeped into my very bones.

For days, I lay there, recovering in that makeshift hospital, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d left part of myself back in that other place. I could still hear the sounds of that faraway jungle in the quiet moments—rustling leaves, distant voices, the thunder of gunfire unlike anything I’d ever known.

One night, as I lay awake in my cot, staring up at the tent ceiling, a young soldier beside me stirred. He’d lost a leg in the Wilderness, but he wasn’t making any sound, just breathing heavily, his eyes wide and staring into some unseen distance.

“It was different,” he murmured. “The guns… the fire… it was different. Like nothing I’ve ever heard.”

My heart skipped a beat. I leaned over, trying to catch his gaze. “What did you see?” I whispered.

He looked at me, his face pale, his eyes haunted. “It was like… another war,” he said, voice trembling. “A place we shouldn’t be. Men with strange weapons, in a place with thick trees, thicker than any forest here.”

A chill ran down my spine. I wasn’t alone. Somehow, some way, this war had touched something else, another time, another battlefield. And we’d crossed into it, just for a moment.

The nurse came by and gently quieted the young soldier, giving him something to ease his pain. But as I lay back down, a thought took root in my mind, a deep, unsettling certainty.

We were part of something much bigger than we could ever understand. War wasn’t just tearing through our land; it was tearing through time itself, ripping men out of place, out of everything they knew, and leaving them lost.

As I drifted back to sleep, I wondered if I’d return to the jungle when I closed my eyes. Or, worse yet, if that distant war would come looking for us one day, finding us here in these tents, in this hell that seemed so endless. I wondered if I’d ever escape it, or if, somehow, I’d be fighting forever, lost in a cycle of battles that stretched beyond any time or place I could understand.

And as sleep overtook me, I swear I heard the faint sound of gunfire echoing in the distance, sharper and louder than any musket I’d ever known.

WritingPrompts,"#Life on the Farm  

WC 547 

My least favorite chore was butchering. As a farm girl,  I had a strong connection to the animals we raised and even though I knew what they were there for, I never wanted to kill, especially not such interesting animals.  

Thankfully the only place I was supposed to butcher was way out back behind the pens just before the corn fields which were used for feed. We raised hogs mostly, and many times when I would be asked to go fetch a hog for a customer, I’d pardon it instead and set it free to roam the corn fields and hopefully find a life of happiness out in the wild.  

We had other animals too, of course. Hell, our barns were crowded with chickens, turkeys, ducks, and a disgruntled old horse. I figured the turkeys should stay outside considering how messy they were, but Ma and Pa insisted we keep them all locked up.  

They kept me locked up too. I know I had a few acres to roam, but it felt like a prison with only a collection of farm animals to keep me company (five hundred and twelve if you count all the chicks). It would have been a lonely life if people didn’t constantly trespass onto our property.  

I met David when he was looking for his lost dog and stumbled onto the property. There was something about him that made me pause and take a different approach than I normally would with strangers. I walked up to him, smiled, and asked what brought him onto our land.  

“Just looking for my dog,” he said in a casual tone that matched his relaxed smile and twinkling eyes. I decided to show him around the farm and talk to him while we looked for his lost dog. He seemed at ease and his heartfelt laugh made me smile, eventually joining in to laugh alongside him.  

“Here’s the hog pens,” I said, guiding him through the maze of fences.  

I saw his nose wrinkle and thought it was because of the dreary color.  

“Lots of mud, I guess.”   

“Yeah. And the smell.” He said.  

“I don’t really notice. But a girl gets tired of the color brown. It’s all mud out here and all dried blood in the butcher shed.”  

“You do the butchering?” He seemed shocked.  

“Yeah.”  

“That’s awful. I can’t imagine having to kill these hogs.”  

“Oh,” I said, “I don’t kill many hogs. I like to set them free instead.”  

“That’s nice of you.”  

My face flushed and I turned to him with a smile. He had a lovely face, but it was crinkled again. He seemed deep in thought.  

“But… then how do y’all stay in business.”  

I shrugged. “Selling meat.”  

I swung open the shed door and let him see what I meant about the dried blood. Normally I would try to salvage the clothes of trespassers but the blood got everywhere and ruined all of the garments and shoes.  

His face paled and he stood frozen at the entryway before rapidly making his excuses and running out into the cornfield.  

I reluctantly grabbed the rifle off of its perch.  

It was a shame, I really did like him. But just like he said, the farm has to stay in business.",throwthisoneintrash,9741,[CW] Smash 'Em Up Sunday - For the Love of Fall,"#**Welcome back to Smash ‘Em Up Sunday!**

For whatever thats worth.

Write a story or poem, **no more than 800 words** in the comments using **at least two** things from the three categories below.  The more you use, the more points you get.  Because yes!

After you are done writing, please be sure to take some time to read through the stories before the next SEUS is posted, and tell me which stories you liked the best. You can give me just a number one, or a top 5, and I’ll enter them in with appropriate weighting. Feel free to DM me on Reddit or Discord (Alyxbee on Discord)!

As a note, I do find it super helpful when folks add the word count to the bottom of their story <3

WritingPrompts,"##A Hen's Duty

The sun rose behind the farm, and the rooster serenaded the lands with his cacophony. Joseph entered the chicken coop, and the birds were huddled in the corner. Joseph approached the nesting box and began to count.

""Hold it."" A large chicken stepped forward. Joseph recognized her as Bertha, a proper name for a poultry. She put her wings on her hips. ""We were listening to the radio you provided for us, and we heard a human expression.""

""What did you hear?"" Joseph knew providing the animals with entertainment would cause consequences, but the pigs were skilled negotiators.

""Never count your chickens before they hatch."" Bertha gestured to the ovoid shapes before him.

""But these aren't going to be chickens. You know that. Unless you want me to bring Gary in here."" Joseph smirked at the hens who collectively shook; a few of them began to molt.

""Heavens no, that man's calls are dreadful. But you are being deliberately obtuse. The purpose of the parable is that one shouldn't be **complacent**. Every morning, you fail to account for the potential harms that come with the storage and transport of the eggs,"" Bertha said.

""Is that so?"" Joseph raised an eyebrow.

""Certainly, we believe that more caution is needed. Don't worry. As equal partners in this endeavor, we have a proposal. We propose that we will watch over our eggs until the farmers market next Saturday, and we will deliver them to the stall as well,"" Bertha said.

""That seems like more work for you. Are you sure you want this?"" Joseph asked.

""Of course, we wouldn't propose it if we weren't willing to accept the labor.""

""Alright."" Joseph left the coop and went about his chores. The rest of his animals were more cooperative, and he went to bed early.

Every morning, he got up later as he no longer had to handle the chickens. He did check on them occasionally to ensure they were doing alright. Within a few days, the nesting box was overflowing. After a week, the chickens had limited space for themselves. Joseph considered helping, but they chose this path. The day before the farmer's market, he heard a loud crash from the coop. Joseph ran there and saw the hens covered in yolk. Bertha inched forward.

""There was an unfortunate accident,"" her voice wavered.

""Is anyone hurt?"" Joseph asked.

""No, but you won't have any eggs for the farmer's market."" Bertha looked down. ""We also have a request?""

""What's that?"" Joseph struggled to hold back his laughter.

""We would like to relinquish our duties as egg caretakers. It doesn't fit our current circumstances.""

""Bertha, there's another human expression that I think you should know.""

""Enlighten us.""

""Don't bite off more than you can chew.""

WritingPrompts,"Oshvold the Heavy had seen a lot of things, both during his time as the Guild Leader and back in his adventuring days, but he wasn’t quite sure he’d ever seen anyone like Helena. 

She had started out like most adventurers that came through his door. Eager to prove herself and frustrated with the types of jobs he’d offered at the start, but there was a method to Oshvold’s madness. Saving cats was a job that showed you if someone had followthrough, goblins would show you they could handle themselves in a fight. 

To the adventurers, especially those that came from other guilds, the jobs were tedious, but to Oshvold, it was all research. Critical information gathering that let him run an efficient and safe guild hall. 

Well, as safe as guild halls got.

No amount of information gathering had prepared him for Helena. The woman pulled a small bundle of bounties out of her bag–so she was who’d been stealing his copies–alongside the signatures marking job completion. 

Oshvold suppressed his surprise as he grabbed his reading glasses, replacing his shock with a gruff, “Guild rules say one job at a time.”

“Sorry,” she said as she took her midnight hair out of her ponytail and let it fall. “Stuff was on the way.”

“On the way? Hm.” Oshvold read over the sheets. It was impressive that she’d taken care of the bandit tribes, considering she usually worked alone, but then he flipped over the last sheet–

He was right, he’d never seen anything like her. That last writ was from the palace, the bounty for the Dragon King. How had she even gotten her– “What rank are you?”

“Gotta cash those in order,” she said, “I should get to journeyman from the cats, then vanguard from the Northern Bandits which would make me legal for the–”

“Yeah yeah,” Oshvold waved a dismissive hand. “You know that the point of the limits ain’t the logistics of it. It’s to keep kids like you safe.”

“Oh,” Helena said. “In that case the order doesn’t matter.”

Oshvold rolled his eyes. He was used to this sort of behavior from Wizards and other egg-heads who tried to game any system they got their ink splotched hands on. From what he understood, Helena couldn’t tell ass from teakettle when it came to magic. “What was your party for the Dragon King job?”

“Rowley.”  
“Rowley?” Oshvold asked, it was just the first name and that didn’t make any sense. Helena might have been confused about magic, but Rowley was confused about everything. “You brought Rowley with–”

“Oh, no. He just pointed me toward the right way at Jaggard’s Crossing when I’d lost my map so…He helped. That puts him in my party right?”

Oshvold looked down at the sheet. She was seriously saying she went alone and–Well the King of Tarvineium had only signed her name on the bounty sheet. Did everyone else possibly die? “Deceased?”

“The Dragon King,” Helena said with the stalwart tone that showed she didn’t know she was answering the wrong question. “On the Dragon King quest. If we’re talking the other quests there was a nest of hornets in one and then about 14 bandits.”

“About?”

“Twelve through fourteen might have made it. I wasn’t sticking around to check. I had places to be.”

“Where did you have–”

“The Dragon–”

“Yeah, the Dragon King,” Oshvold nodded along as he caught onto the answer to his question. “Look. Helena.”

“Yeah?”

“You did good work here.”

“Thank you\!”

“But.” Oshvold slammed the pile of papers in front of her to draw her attention and set the scale for his next words. “The rails are there to keep you safe, Helena. You can’t just go ignoring the order and embarking on high level missions alone.” 

“Oh,” she said, “I’ll bring someone next time then.” She offered a weak thumbs up. If it wasn’t for professionalism Oshvold would have sworn, instead he just massaged his temples. 

“Just one more question before payout,” he said. 

“Sure.”

“Why in the patheon did you feel like you had to do this?” he asked. 

“Oh\! That’s easy. I was speaking to Sarif, the mage, and I asked if she’d let me take her out to dinner. She didn’t seem that interested.”

Oshvold nodded. That sounded like Sarif. 

“But then I asked if I could change her mind, and she said I just needed to kill the Dragon King.”

“What?”

“So I did,” Helena shook her head to fluff her freshly released hair, her armor clattering as she did. “Now I just need to find her this evening to let her know I did it and that we can go on that date.”

Oshvold was a professional at keeping his mouth shut, it was almost half his job, dealing with egotistical adventurers. That said, he couldn’t keep the next words to himself. “Oh you poor girl.”

“What?”

“So you’re telling me,” Oshvold said to the blood soaked adventurer. “You defeated the Dragon King, wiped out the Northern Bandit Tribes, and rescued six cats from trees all because you wanted to impress Sarif?”

“Yeah.”

“Oh Helena,” he said, reaching across the table and grabbing her hands. “Sarif didn’t really want you to kill the Dragon King.”

“Then why’d she say it?” 

“She said it instead of no,” Oshvold explained. “To someone like you, killing the Dragon King is supposed to be impossible. Like the Infernum freezing over, or Illsmoth blinking every eye at once.”

Helena stared at Oshvold for a moment. “So she meant to say no?”

“Yes.”

“Then why didn’t she just say that?”

There was a lot of things Oshvold could say to that. There was the fact that most people would understand what she meant. The fact that most people would get killed trying if they didn’t understand Sarif’s meaning. The fact that Sarif, above all, was a bastard. 

Instead he said none of them and only offered a small smile. “No idea Helena. Would you like your payment in Gold or Platinum?”

“Oh\!” she seemed to forget her mild heartbreak at the mention of money. “Platinum please.”

Oshvold turned away from the bar to find a safe and chuckled to himself once he was out of earshot. He was sure that he’d never met anyone like Helena, but he was starting to wondering where he could find more of them.",Writteninsanity,156529,"[WP] “So you’re telling me,” the Guild Leader said to the blood soaked adventurer. “You defeated the Dragon King, wiped out the Northern Bandit Tribes, and rescued six cats from trees all because you wanted to impress a girl?”",,196,2024-11-14 21:25:14

ExplainLikeImFive,"(Quick clarification: ALL of this should be thought of as *relative to some chosen reference frame*. So when I talk about velocity ~~or acceleration~~, it's not absolute, but relative to some other point in space.)

Think about driving from one city to another city 100 miles directly south of it. What's the fastest way to get there? Obviously driving directly south, because every mile you drive gets you 1 mile further south, and 1 mile closer to your destination.

But now imagine if you have to turn away from south. If you turn 45 degrees right so youre driving exactly southwest, now every 1 mile you drive forward, you're ending up *less than* 1 mile further south, only around 0.7 miles actually (and 0.7 miles further west). The farther you turn right, the less of your distance travelled is going towards travelling south, until at 90 degrees (or facing directly west), 0% of your distance travelled forward is in a southward direction. You could drive for 100 miles but you'd never move any further south.

This same thing applies to space and time, because as Einstein discovered, space and time are just two dimensions of the same thing (just like north-south and east-west are two dimensions of the same thing, not something completely separate from each other).

Just like the car, you're moving through this space-time field in a certain direction, and like the car you can ""turn"" your direction of motion through the field. If you were moving directly ""time-ward"" (like how the example started moving directly southward), then 100% of your motion would be ""time-ward"", and 0% of it would be ""space-ward"". In other words, it means you're not moving! (Relative to some other reference point)

If you then ""turned"" your direction of motion through space-time, you'd start moving slightly more ""space-ward"" (like how turning right from south starts moving you a little more west and a little less south), so necessarily a little less ""time-ward"". Turn your direction more, and more of your motion goes towards travelling through space than time. Eventually if you make your entire motion travel in the space direction and none of it in the time direction, you won't experience any time pass from your point of view!

This process is exactly what happens when you start stationary to some reference point (100% time, 0% space), then start accelerating and gaining speed (some% time, some% space), and finally reach light speed (0% time, 100% space).

TL;DR: Space and time are just two ""directions"" in the same field, like south and west are two directions in space. If you move at a certain speed, then you always travel the same total distance in a given amount of time, but if you change your direction of motion you can affect how much of that distance is in one direction or the other. Increasing your velocity through space ""turns"" your direction of motion from ""time-ward"" towards ""space-ward"", and thus traveling a farther space distance means you travel less time-distance, or in other words, your time slows down.",BattleAnus,59034,"ELI5: "" The faster you move in space, the slower you move in time.The faster you move in time, the slower you move in space.""",,941,2024-11-14 16:45:35

ExplainLikeImFive,"On most automatic cars there is a device between the engine and the transmission called a torque converter. This is usually in the form of 2 turbines side by side (one attached to the engine output shaft and one attached to the transmission input shaft). Those 2 turbines are in one closed chamber of very thick oil. So when the engine turbine spins, it makes the oil spin with it, which want to make the transmission one spin. Car brakes will always be strong enough to counteract this force by the oil, but the design of the turbines, the design of the chamber and thr viscosity of the oil have been engineered to make sure power can be transferred efficiently so as soon as you start to release the brakes, there is enough force to make the transmission side turbine to spin. And since the first gear on a car is very easy to spin, requires low torque, the car starts to move.",draftstone,200864,ELI5: How is an automatic car always in gear when you let off the brake?

ExplainLikeImFive,[removed],[deleted],0,ELI5: How/Why did X-Ray medical imaging change to seem less dangerous than it used to be? ,"I remember dental assistants setting up the imaging device and running behind a lead-lined wall when a large, noisy camera took images of teeth.

I get technology evolved, but how are X-rays done now that seem to have taken the fear away from them?

<EDIT> OK the consensus seems to be digital imaging requires less exposure and X-Ray techs shouldnt be exposing themselves anyway. ",255,2024-11-14 14:56:44
ExplainLikeImFive,"I service xray machines. Unless you absolutely need to be in the room at the same time, you must definitely still run behind a lead shield to this day. That has never changed.





There's times you need to be in the room at the same time. Like if you're doing an interventional surgical case. You can't have an entire OR just walk out while the patient is bleeding out to get an image.

But in those situations you'll don a lead apron and use smaller lead shields that are hanging from the ceiling and protect yourself as much as you can. And typically those that don't need to be directly at the patient table will be behind mobile lead shields well protected.



But we've also made the technology much better. 


The image sensors are much more sensitive, meaning we can use less xray dose for better images. We also use computers to see small contrast differences that might normally be invisible to the eye, and bump up the contrast in those details which let's us see more. We've also gotten better at controlling the xray. When you stop releasing xray it actually ramps down over a fraction of a second, and during that ramp down weaker xray photons are released, and that's actually not great because the weaker they are the more likely they are to interact with your cells, causing damage. So we've made that ramp down even smaller and shorter. We've also employed filtering to help filter out weaker xray photons.


But at the end of the day, they are still dangerous and unless you need to, don't be in the room at the same time. Minimizing how often and how much time you are exposed is a big part in safety.",FabianN,59271,ELI5: How/Why did X-Ray medical imaging change to seem less dangerous than it used to be? ,"I remember dental assistants setting up the imaging device and running behind a lead-lined wall when a large, noisy camera took images of teeth.

**Reddit Moderation!**

What could more perfectly complement your fulfilling lifestyle than playing internet cop on Reddit? See a post you disagree with? You can delete it! User making valid points and hurting your feelings in modmail? Mute them! Having a bad day? Just ban a random, unsuspecting individual!

`**Disclaimer for Mod Code of Conduct purposes: you can't actually do any of this`

On to more serious matters,

We are in need of more moderators to help maintain the subreddit. No experience is needed. All we ask is that you have the time, patience and a good sense of humor. Our team will be available to train you and answer any questions you have. Communication is a *must* and really, why wouldn't you want to talk to us? You'll be placed on a probationary period to start and we fully understand that mistakes will be made and activity may fluctuate. Please note that being selected as a mod does not guarantee you will be a permanent addition. Not everyone is a good fit and that's okay.

So what does moderating actually entail?

* Clearing the queue will be your #1 task. The queue is where you'll see any content that has been reported or our automod has flagged for review. All you have to do is go through it, read the content and decide whether to remove it, approve it and sometimes report or ban a user. The queue fills up *fast* and needs a lot of attention. Seriously, some of you need to lay off the spam reports.
* Modmail is your next task. It's mostly users asking why their post is missing (automod ate it 99% of the time) and asking that you fix it. We also recieve ban appeals here. If you're lucky, you'll get a death threat every now and then. Hooray! If any modmails are uncomfortable, too personal or upsetting to you, you can delegate it to another mod.
* Sometimes a post will come up that's especially spicy or attracting a lot of attention. When this happens, one of our mods likes to comb through the comments for violations or sit on it to monitor incoming comments for violations. If it gets too much to handle, or someone isn't available, you can lock it.
* Communicating with the team is one of the most important tasks in your role as a moderator. As a team, we discuss moderation actions, rule changes, sub events and the direction of the subreddit. That all sounds very boring but rest assured, there's a lot more casual talk than anything else so feel free to chime in on Beaver's dislike of garlic bread (encouraged), Tim sharing new sanrio drops or my Call of Duty K/D ratio.
* Lastly, let's talk about the meta. Sometimes things need doing on the sub, like this recruitment post I was supposed to make months ago. While the day to day is important, we also need to keep the sub up to date with new features and tools and update it to fit the growing userbase.

If you managed to get through all that, congrats! You made it to the actual app, which is also long and annoying. Here's a tip for applying: there is a short quiz portion to the app. We don't care if you get everything right, we just want to see your line of reasoning and understanding of the rules and subreddit culture.

No, your hot takes about the election, whether celebratory or gloomy, are not what this subreddit is for.

No, you whining about how much you have to see posts about the election is not what this subreddit is for.  Also, you're playing yourself when you do that.

No, making a post titled ""WWIII"" to bypass the filter (which includes both Trump and Harris) won't convince us to leave your post up.

There are many, many places to talk about the election on and off of reddit.  This is not one of them.  We've had dozens, possibly hundreds of posts removed.  Given that nobody reads these pinned posts or the rules on the side, I expect we'll have dozens to hundreds more!

TrueOffMyChest,"Cool, it’s great when these type of crazy situations go right",Lucasbasques,61828,My wife is insane and it made us 185k,"So I posted earlier about how much I love my wife and I truly cannot emphasize that enough.  My wife is such an amazing person and she has had to overcome so much crazy shit in her life.  The most heartbreaking thing anyone has ever said to me was when she once told me ""you are the only man in my life I've ever felt safe with.""

Anyway, when my wife and I first met we fell in love so fast it was scary, but only 3 months after meeting she came to me with an insane proposal.  We had been discussing moving in together and rather than renting a place, she asked me to buy a house with her.  I was 23, just starting my career, I wasn't even thinking about buying a house, but she was so passionate about it.  She had apparently been looking constantly at the market and she found this foreclosed starter home, but couldn't quite afford it on her own.  

We had literally been together 3 months and in most contexts this just would have been a terrible and insane thing to do, but I was so in love with her and she explained what a good investment it was so convincingly that I agreed.  I put down 8k, she put down 12k and we bought this place for 200k together.  We got married 9 months after buying it, had our first kid 12 months after that.  

Not only was this place our first home (we had many happy memories there), but we used it as a rental after getting a slightly bigger home and it pretty much was what enabled us to afford childcare comfortably.  We just sold it for 385k, 185k more than what we paid for it.  It is entirely because of my wife that we did this.  She is just so fucking awesome it's wild.  ",9006,2024-11-14 16:34:07

He tried to blame it on being drunk but he later admitted that he didn't drink as much as he pretended too and wasn't really drunk at either the bachelor party or the reception. The best man had apparently kept the groom away from any shenanigans with the strippers. The best man did not drink anything since he was the designated driver.

I thought we were mutually each other's best friends: turns out I didn't even make it into her top three. This is a person who I see regularly, who I have traveled with extensively outside the country, I've celebrated a lot of life events with, and who officiated my wedding last year (I didn't have a bridal party, so she was the only person that had a special role). 

Before I knew who her wedding party was, I had offered to do a reading, thinking I could return the favor for officiating our wedding. A couple weeks later, she asked me if I would do the reading and she said that would be great because she and her husband were deciding to keep the wedding party small. I was a couple drinks in, and it took me a second to realize that this was her way of saying I wasn't in the wedding party. I put on a good face, and thought, ""Hell, at least I'm involved, and I'm sure she'll make keep me involved in other ways."" I'm not a particularly traditional person, so maybe she figured I wouldn't care as much? Over the next year of planning, she didn't really include me, despite the fact that I offered help and expressed interest. I was feeling okay about the whole thing, but during the wedding, I found out that I wasn't invited to the rehearsal dinner, despite the fact that I would be doing something during the wedding. I had also asked that we also get a professional photo together so I could put it with one I had from my wedding. That didn't happen either.   
  
Needless to say, I'm baffled and saddened by the whole thing.  I'd like to pretend like I'm not hurt, but it's forced me to reevaluate a relationship that I considered on par with family. I went from thinking that this person was my ride-or-die, to feeling that she didn't want me around. Other people who know both of us are also confused and think it's weird. To be fair, their perception of our friendship could be biased by how I talk about it. My husband thinks I'm making a mountain out of a molehill, but he also doesn't have any close friendships that are anywhere as intimate as this. 

Should I bring this up to my friend, or should I just stay quiet and distance myself a bit? I can't imagine that much good will come of bringing it up this late, but I truly feel like I've been grieving a deep friendship that I'm realizing now may have been a bit one-sided.

relationships,Sad to say but you need to put your foot down with him because children can pick up on stuff like that. You have to just tell him that he needs to stay on his meds and start therapy (maybe even couple's therapy which I honestly would recommend since that can help with communication on both ends).  It does sound that he's partially sexually frustrated but to essentially take it out on you the way he has been also shows he has other issues as well. If he's not going to do those 2 things for you then it might be best to temporarily stay at a friend or family member's place until he agrees to at least put himself on the path to getting more control of his emotions.,Emergency-Mud7022,3038,Advice for stopping arguments?,"I (27F) have been married to my husband (26M) for 2 years now but we have been off and on since grade school. We have both dated other people, had our share of that, and came back together later when we were ready to settle down. We have always been super lovey in the way we communicate and treat each other. We had a son a few years ago and of course with a new baby brings new stress in a relationship. We tend to get along together fine on a day to day basis with no real bickering or issues, but when we do fight, it is so bad. 

My husband is usually very kind and caring, but over the last few years as our sex life has not been as active as usual (with the toddler, hormone issues, etc) he has started to lash out randomly and become very aggressive and extreme. We have had many arguments over our sex life as he does not feel like we have sex enough. At the worst of it, we may only have sex once a week or so which I feel like is not awful compared to some, but he sees it as me not wanting him. This is not the case at all and I try to reassure him each time he expresses these feelings, but I do understand how badly it can feel to feel unwanted. What I don’t understand is how he treats me sometimes. 

Randomly, he will have outbursts that seemingly come from nowhere. For example - tonight we have a good night together, a great day together, we were even texting earlier in the day about how much we loved and appreciated each other and how lucky we are for our family. We said our goodnights and I love yous and went to sleep. Around midnight, our toddler woke up crying. My husband jumped out of bed and grabbed his things and stormed out of the bedroom (this is unusual for him, as I work tomorrow and he stays home so typically he would help take care of our child). I came out to the living room to ask him if he was okay and he responded “I am so sweaty” I told him to turn the heat down and this is when he went off. He starting yelling at me, mocking me, and talking to me in a way that was not okay. He ended up slamming our bedroom door as well. This came from nowhere and the way he spoke to me and mocked me made me feel like it was borderline verbally abusive. Again this is just tonight’s example but this happens ever month or so. Sometimes he will curse at me, call me b****, or say fu** you. I have asked him to go to therapy or talk to a doctor about his anger issues. He started on a depression medication awhile ago and then randomly stopped taking it because he was “better” and refused to start it again. 

I know I’m probably rambling on but I’m just not sure what to do at this point. Everytime this happens I tell him that I can’t keep being treated this way and that I want to support him and get him help but if he won’t do it himself then there is nothing I can do. It makes me miserable but it doesn’t happen every day or even every week so I don’t know if this is normal and I am just being sensitive or what. I love my husband and I don’t want to split our family but I just feel like I deserve more than this and I wish he felt that way and would get help. 

How can I help support him to figure this out? Any advice on healthy ways to communicate this? ",5,2024-11-15 00:53:19
relationships,"He needs to get help and address his issues or you need to leave him. You should not raise your child in a household where one parent is being verbally and emotionally abusive. If you cannot leave for yourself, you need to be willing to do it to protect your child. Don't do the toxic ""staying for the kids"" thing that produces really traumatized children, who become adults who accept shitty relationships.

And don't respond ""he's a great dad""; it doesn't matter if he's a great caretaker or whatever, if he's screaming and having meltdowns that will traumatize your child. 

You need to be less gentle with this. He NEEDS to get help. And not like try for a little bit and then stop, saying he's ""better"". Honestly, I doubt he will be willing to do this, based on what you've said.",echosiah,109987,Advice for stopping arguments?,"I (27F) have been married to my husband (26M) for 2 years now but we have been off and on since grade school. We have both dated other people, had our share of that, and came back together later when we were ready to settle down. We have always been super lovey in the way we communicate and treat each other. We had a son a few years ago and of course with a new baby brings new stress in a relationship. We tend to get along together fine on a day to day basis with no real bickering or issues, but when we do fight, it is so bad. 

My husband is usually very kind and caring, but over the last few years as our sex life has not been as active as usual (with the toddler, hormone issues, etc) he has started to lash out randomly and become very aggressive and extreme. We have had many arguments over our sex life as he does not feel like we have sex enough. At the worst of it, we may only have sex once a week or so which I feel like is not awful compared to some, but he sees it as me not wanting him. This is not the case at all and I try to reassure him each time he expresses these feelings, but I do understand how badly it can feel to feel unwanted. What I don’t understand is how he treats me sometimes. 

Randomly, he will have outbursts that seemingly come from nowhere. For example - tonight we have a good night together, a great day together, we were even texting earlier in the day about how much we loved and appreciated each other and how lucky we are for our family. We said our goodnights and I love yous and went to sleep. Around midnight, our toddler woke up crying. My husband jumped out of bed and grabbed his things and stormed out of the bedroom (this is unusual for him, as I work tomorrow and he stays home so typically he would help take care of our child). I came out to the living room to ask him if he was okay and he responded “I am so sweaty” I told him to turn the heat down and this is when he went off. He starting yelling at me, mocking me, and talking to me in a way that was not okay. He ended up slamming our bedroom door as well. This came from nowhere and the way he spoke to me and mocked me made me feel like it was borderline verbally abusive. Again this is just tonight’s example but this happens ever month or so. Sometimes he will curse at me, call me b****, or say fu** you. I have asked him to go to therapy or talk to a doctor about his anger issues. He started on a depression medication awhile ago and then randomly stopped taking it because he was “better” and refused to start it again. 

I know I’m probably rambling on but I’m just not sure what to do at this point. Everytime this happens I tell him that I can’t keep being treated this way and that I want to support him and get him help but if he won’t do it himself then there is nothing I can do. It makes me miserable but it doesn’t happen every day or even every week so I don’t know if this is normal and I am just being sensitive or what. I love my husband and I don’t want to split our family but I just feel like I deserve more than this and I wish he felt that way and would get help. 

How can I help support him to figure this out? Any advice on healthy ways to communicate this? ",5,2024-11-15 02:25:50

Confession,We appreciate your service 🫡. Fuck the scammers and I’m sorry you lost your job,Travelgirlworldwide,234,"I Worked for a Major Food Delivery Service, and It Was Full of Scams. I Fought Back, and Here’s How That Went Down. ","Back in the day, I got hired as a customer service rep for a huge food delivery service. You know the kind—one of those apps everyone’s got on their phone. I wasn’t working directly for them; my company was contracted to handle all their customer service. At first, I was genuinely excited about the job. I actually felt proud to be part of something that, at least on the surface, seemed like it made people’s lives easier.

But pretty soon, I saw things that didn’t sit right. And by “didn’t sit right,” I mean I saw open scams happening every single day. It wasn’t just the occasional mistake or lazy customer service; it was full-on fraud being green-lit and ignored because everyone at the top was profiting.

Here’s how it went down: Some restaurants on the app were legit—others, not so much. These sketchy places knew exactly how to exploit the app's refund policies, almost like they had our internal guidebook memorized. They’d “accept” orders but not even bother making the food. Instead, they’d keep the line busy or let it ring. They’d wait long enough that when the delivery window passed, they could claim, “Oh, the food was made and delivered.”

And you know what’s worse? Some of these businesses were nearly untraceable for us CSRs. They’d found every loophole, and we basically had to take their word for it. People were paying with debit cards, so getting refunds was already a hassle unless you met certain criteria, criteria these scam restaurants knew to avoid like the plague.

At first, I tried to let it slide, thinking maybe I was wrong. But I wasn’t wrong. I saw so many customers being scammed, so I decided to step in and do something about it.

I started small, so no one would notice. I’d cancel orders I knew were scams, especially with places I’d flagged as frequent offenders. The “restaurants” would call in, furious, yelling at us for “system errors” they thought were cheating them out of their scam payday. I’d apologize with the most professional “Sorry, our system’s down for maintenance,” or another bullshit excuse they cannot pursue us for, and secretly enjoy the fact that they weren’t getting a single cent that day.

When I got away with that, I went a little further. I started shutting down scam restaurants for entire shifts. Sometimes I’d take them off the app completely while I was on duty. And guess what? Customers were actually happier—because the businesses that were left actually delivered real food. Everyone benefitted, except the scumbags at the top and the businesses taking advantage of people. And I felt like I was actually doing the job they’d hired me for, just with a little more backbone than they’d bargained for.

But my luck ran out eventually and upper management noticed something was off. They didn’t have hard evidence, but they could tell that someone was making changes and it was always during my shift. They didn’t even question me—they just fired me on the spot. I didn’t get a chance to explain, and honestly? I don’t think they would’ve listened and would have probably made things worse for me. It was easier for them to fire the “problem” than address the massive issue of fraud happening on their app.

Would I do it again? Honestly… yeah, but I’d probably be a little smarter about it. Do I regret it? Kind of, but also, no. What I did wasn’t “right” by the book, but sometimes you have to go off-script. I just wish the thousands of people still getting scammed every day had someone on their side willing to stand up against these crooks.

But my luck ran out eventually and upper management noticed something was off. They didn’t have hard evidence, but they could tell that someone was making changes and it was always during my shift. They didn’t even question me—they just fired me on the spot. I didn’t get a chance to explain, and honestly? I don’t think they would’ve listened and would have probably made things worse for me. It was easier for them to fire the “problem” than address the massive issue of fraud happening on their app.

Would I do it again? Honestly… yeah, but I’d probably be a little smarter about it. Do I regret it? Kind of, but also, no. What I did wasn’t “right” by the book, but sometimes you have to go off-script. I just wish the thousands of people still getting scammed every day had someone on their side willing to stand up against these crooks.

I didn’t walk away with a clear conscience, but I walked away knowing I did something. And maybe that’s enough.",99,2024-11-14 21:59:17

We ask that authors focus on creating stories within horror and thriller stories. You may borrow from other genres, but the main focus of the story **MUST** be to horrify, scare, or unsettle. Stories with jokey punchline will be removed. We shouldn't be laughing at the end of the story. Stories dealing with depression, suicide, mental illness, medical ailments, and other assorted topics belong over on /r/ShortSadStories. However, this doesn't mean you cannot use these topics in your stories. There's a delicate balance between something horrifying and sad. If we can interpret the story as being scary, we will do so. 

Please note that badly written stories, don't necessarily fall under this category. The story can be terrible, but still be focused on horror.

ShortScaryStories,"A while ago, I wrote a [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/12rqtsp/focus_on_the_turbulence/) about a passenger trapped inside of a plane, alongside a not-so-friendly air hostess. I really enjoyed writing that story, and so challenged myself to write a story in the same vein, albeit with a different approach.

On another note, I had a few more ideas for this story which didn't quite make the cut (how does 500 words get used up so fast?), and so I am considering maybe turning this story into a short series.

And as always, if you like reading stories that are spawned from an even mix of procrastination and sleepless nights, you can check out the rest at r/ineedabettersub.",ineedabettertitle,8573,"In 2014, I boarded a train. It's been 10 years and I still haven't reached my destination. ","An embarrassing amount of time passed before I realized something was wrong.

I had made this train journey almost daily for over two decades and could tell by muscle memory now when the brakes would screech and the doors would open. And yet it hadn’t happened yet.

I checked my watch. It displayed 4:15. *That’s odd. We definitely should have stopped somewhere by now.* 

I looked out the window to try and discern where we were. I only studied the passing landscape for a few seconds before my brain began to scream at me, signalling that there was something *wrong* with what I was looking at. I couldn’t make out any particular shapes outside. It seemed as if the landscape had been reformed into a singular blob of mass and color.

Nothing that I was looking at resembled *anything* that I had seen before. 

I stood up and made my way to the end door of the carriage, trying to see if the other carriages were experiencing the same problem. It was locked.

What’s more, after peering through the carriage window, I saw nothing but the swirling colors around us. It was as if our train was connected to nothing. 

It was as if we were alone. 

I heard the sound of yelling and glass breaking from behind me. I spun around and saw a couple passengers crowding around a man standing on one of the chairs, looking towards the now-open window.

“You’re seeing this too, right?” He called out, his voice queasy. “This shit ain’t *real.*”

No one replied. 

“I can’t do this man. I don’t know what’s going on!” I could see fire burning in his eyes, his hair whipping around due to the draft.

As he looked outside the open window, I saw a strange calmness settle over him. He had resigned himself to this fate, whatever it was. He took a deep breath. And jumped. 

His jump seemed to have very little momentum.

Instead, as soon as his entire body left the train carriage he froze into place. He was still for a blissful second, before he *separated* before our eyes. Every piece of him disjoined from each other, and he was left frozen in place as billions of molecules vaguely resembling a person.

And yet he was still *alive*. 

Or at least I gathered from the screams that emanated from him. Panicking, I fell to the ground, cupping my ears with my palms, trying to escape the raw, guttural sounds that pierced my head. 

It was the sound of death from someone who could not die. 

I’m not sure how long it’s been since I made the mistake of boarding this train. None of us passengers have aged, or eaten, or done anything that is usually recognized as being required for survival. Sometimes we pass the passenger outside, still frozen in time, like a lighthouse of solidity in a sea of shapelessness.

And the worst part?

We always hear him before we see him. ",309,2024-11-14 20:37:28

It’s a habit she’s had since I first started kindergarten. 
Back then, it would be my favourite cartoon characters colourfully drawn in scene, cute quotes and words of encouragement. 

As I entered my teens, the colours tapered off a bit and the drawings seemed to reflect my teenage moody self, a lot of deep purples, blacks and whites were used to create scenes of stormy weather, ocean waves and rollercoaster rides.

Honestly id mostly forgotten about the lunch bags. 
I’m not a teen, certainly not a child anymore. 
I hadn’t had a packed lunch in years. Hadn’t thought about the drawings.

But recently, my luck changed. I was fired from work, my fiance left me the same week.
Suddenly I found myself back at my mother’s home, sleeping in my small childhood bed, surrounded by posters and stale memories.

Weeks passed, and on my first day at my new job, mum presented me with a packed lunch. 

When I got my break at lunchtime, seeing my mother’s drawing of a man dressed in a suit, briefcase in hand, a large grin on his face. “Have a happy day, son!” Mum had written in bright green marker.

It’s been a couple months now. I like my new job. I enjoy living with mum. But things have gotten.. strange.

I started noticing the drawings on my lunch bag were becoming.. odd.

Last Tuesday, for instance. I took out the paper bag, ready to enjoy my salami salad roll, to be greeted by carnage. 

Black and red scribbles, the writing mostly intelligible, apart from one sentence I could make out “help me”

I went home sick, even though I wasn’t technically unwell, I was sick with worry. But when I got home mum was fine, sitting on the porch staring off Into the woodlands, and when I asked her about it she just gave me a small smile and shrugged it off.

The rest of the week the drawings got more vulgar, more graphic. I have tried to talk to mum about it. She’s been locked in her room most of the week, only leaving to pack me a lunch every day, it seemed. She will not come out when I knock. 

I tried to brush it off. Tried to find explanations.

By the next Friday, the drawing was simple. There were no unreadable words, no messy scribbles.
A detailed sketch of a Single gravestone under a willow tree. My name, in delicate cursive, carved into the tombstone.

I left work immediately, and got home to an empty house. It took a while, but after pleading with mum to be let in, only to be met with silence, I took matters into my own hands and busted down the door to her bedroom
I’m not sure how long she has been dead for but her mummified state tells me it’s been a while.

ShortScaryStories,Ohh... too bad your deal didn't include Kayla's health.,MizMeowMeow,760,The Upstairs Couple's Kids Keep Dying,"Clarence and Jamie Wilson. Unit 206. 

6 children in the last 9 years. Most of them have lasted for less than 5 months. 

It has always looked suspicious. Rumors of poisoning, shaken baby syndrome, or outright neglect have circled around them for years. But none of them have ever been proven true. 

No doctor has ever been able to find a cause for so many deaths. Each baby presents differently. One with multi-organ failure, another with fatal pneumonia, most recently a neonatal stroke. There has never been shred of evidence to suggest neglect, nothing to indicate they have ever inflicted any harm onto their children. 

Some consider it immoral to bring a child into this world knowing they will likely suffer the same fate. Jamie believes it is her only choice.

Jamie lays little Jeffrey down in his crib. He is only 3 months old. A small tear streams down her face as she watches him break out into a coughing fit, quickly turning blue. Respiratory failure. She knows he stands no chance. Jamie lets out one deep sob and leaves him there. 

She walks down the hall into Kayla’s room. Kayla lays in her usual position, the oxygen mask glued to her face. Based on the severity of her cystic fibrosis, the doctors predicted that she wouldn’t live past 6. Yesterday, they celebrated her 12th birthday. 

Jamie knows she is only buying time. 

How many souls are worth the life of one child? It is not for me to decide. As long as she keeps her end of the bargain, I will continue to oblige.

Some consider it immoral to bring a child into this world knowing they will likely suffer the same fate. Jamie believes it is her only choice.

Jamie lays little Jeffrey down in his crib. He is only 3 months old. A small tear streams down her face as she watches him break out into a coughing fit, quickly turning blue. Respiratory failure. She knows he stands no chance. Jamie lets out one deep sob and leaves him there. 

She walks down the hall into Kayla’s room. Kayla lays in her usual position, the oxygen mask glued to her face. Based on the severity of her cystic fibrosis, the doctors predicted that she wouldn’t live past 6. Yesterday, they celebrated her 12th birthday. 

Jamie knows she is only buying time. 

How many souls are worth the life of one child? It is not for me to decide. As long as she keeps her end of the bargain, I will continue to oblige. 

I watch Jeffery take his last breath, and grant Kayla another year of life.",1075,2024-11-14 13:20:37
ProRevenge,"Well played, especially managing to keep a straight face when he asked you about turning the water off",MrTempleDene,15161,"Neighbor was stealing water from my supply, so I ruined him.","I live in Asia, and just purchased a new house. Now, the previous owners were family friends who needed cash urgently and haven't been living in my country for nearly 3 years. So I got it for a great price in the middle of the capital city.

The sale was finalized at the start of this month and I moved in right after. The house was definitely a fixer upper, as the previous owners had left mid renovation and the main door was locked with just a padlock, not even a door lock. 

The house had no gate, meaning anyone could just walk right on in. The first day I moved in, someone's bike was parked in the garage. I just parked it on the road on the same day I had a gate installed. An angry man was knocking on my gate later and I didn't bother answering, but through my window I could see him giving up and taking the bike after 15 minutes. 

So already, I wasn't digging the neighborhood. But I didn't have any incidents after that, aside from people not knowing that this was no longer an abandoned house, so my gate was blocked more often than never but a ""No Parking"" sign on my gate fixed that issue. 

Last week, I was having a shower in my bathroom and I noticed my water pressure was lower than usual. I also heard my next door neighbors water pump going. Now this neighbor, an old guy, lived in a 3 storied house, the first being the lowest and the one he lived in. The other two floors were rented out to tenants. 

This guy wasn't happy about the house being sold, and voiced many concerns to my friends the previous owners. He was super angry about it, and my friends did warn me but I'm a 6ft guy with 3 dogs. No way he was doing anything and yep, he didn't. 

So with this living situation, a water pump is needed to pump water to the tanks on the roof, since the public supply's pressure is not enough to get it up 3 stories. 

Now, I heard the water pump going and immediately was suspicious. Sure, coincidences exist, but it wouldn't hurt to check it out. I waited till his pump turned off, and then turned on different taps in the house. Sure enough, the pressure was back to normal. 

This made me even more suspicious, but if he was stealing water, it also made sense. The water bills had been going up over the years this house wasn't lived in, but the house also had some water leaks. So it was chalked up to that, even if the bills were too high to be caused just by leaks. Now it's starting to make sense. 

At some point in the last 3 years, this old miser thought he'd save the cost of paying for water, and waltzed into the property and is siphoning water from my lines. I couldn't find where exactly he was siphoning water from, but after checking my pressure multiple times, I was pretty sure.

So I sat on it for a few days, thinking if I should confront him, go the legal path or just let it be. Now, water in my country is very cheap. My total bill, even with washing 3 animals, a car every week and watering my garden only cost like $5 per month, even with the neighbor also stealing some of it. 

But it wasn't about how much I was paying or who was paying for it. It's about entitled old people who think that they're deserving of using other people's resources without paying for it, and then getting away with it. It didn't sit right with me, and I really wanted to teach him a lesson. 

What I did was really simple. I just turned off my water from the mains. I wouldn't have to break into his property, nor would I be breaking any laws. It was the best way of getting back at him without needing to even lift a muscle. 

So on Monday, just 4 days ago, I waited till the pump flicked on, and turned off the supply. Now, the way household tanks work in my country, is that there's a ball valve in the tank which detects the level of water and turns on the pump. If the level doesn't increase, the valve stays open which electronically sends a signal to the pump to stay on until the level gets to a point at which the valve closes and also shuts off the pump. 

However, the level wasn't increasing and anyone knows that starving a pump of water isn't a good idea. This way, my expectation was that I'd burn out his pump and cause issues with his tenants. 

What I didn't account for is that his pump running constantly would mess up the fuses by constantly drawing power overnight and absolutely destroy his wiring. If he decided to upgrade his household wiring to a more modern standard, this would've been prevented. This house clearly still had 90s era wiring. 

At around 3AM, I heard all residents in the house waking up and talking in hushed voices about why just their house in the neighborhood doesn't have power or water. I found out about the power part, because the tenants devolved into shouting at their landlord. 

Our tenant protection laws are very important, and power and water are classed as essential even on a state level. Cutting those services are grounds for lawsuits, unless due to weather or some other unavoidable reason. 

In this case, the landlord is responsible for keeping the house wiring up to date and in good condition, alongside the supply of water. So the tenants were not happy and one of them immediately moved out two days later when it was informed that water and power will not be returning the very same day this happened. 

Both tenants in the two floors lodged a complaint with the police, and if a person is in clear breach of laws, the police have the authority to fine or penalize the person without a court judgment. It can be challenged in court if the person thinks that they were unfairly penalized, but they still have to pay the fines and will only be refunded if and when the court finds the fines unlawful.

So now, the landlord lost both tenants and has to pay a fine of $500, which is a lot of money in our country. He also has to refund the security deposits of both tenants, and cannot rent out until both issues are fixed, which will cost him more money. 

As of right now, he's moving out on Sunday to his daughter's place since he cannot afford to live alone. The tenants were his only source of income, and he's a retired mechanic, so he has no other income. 

He did find out why the motor kept drawing power, overloaded the wiring and burned out. He came by to my gate and asked me if I turned off my water, and I said ""oh yeah, my tank had a new leak on a pipe and I turned it off till the next day until the plumber came by to fix the issue"".

Y'all, the look on his face. He kept a straight one, but I just knew he was holding back. He just said ""oh okay"" and went back inside. Not sure if he knows I know, but I don't care because he can't do anything. 

I'm getting a plumber down next week to correct my plumbing and remove any pipes that leave my property. So I got rid of my water issue and a neighbor who could potentially be a pain in the ass, by simply flicking a tap off. Two birds one stone I'd say. 

TLDR: Bought an abandoned house, neighbor was siphoning water from my supply. Turned off my water supply when the motor was running, motor burned out the wiring in the house and cut off water and power to him and his tenants. Tenants lodged police complaints and the landlord got fined, is now destitute and forced to move in with his daughter.",12583,2024-11-07 16:27:12

I disclosed this to a friend and they directed me here. ThrowAway for obvious reasons, it's a long read but the setup and backstory are important.

7 years ago I was lucky enough to be able to buy my own place, I had saved for 10 years, worked my ass off, and I was so happy to be able to have a place to call my own.

Now, being a single person on the mortgage meant I had to make compromises, one such compromise was buying a property on a shared block (a lot cheaper). Where I'm from this usually means it's on a ""strata"" title. For some that's a bonus as it means there's a communal fund for repairs, typically insurance is cheaper as it's collective, and other things like maintenance being taken care of. Strata titles also come with a lot of by-laws and restrictions on what you can and can't do. I'm a pretty private and introverted person so having to deal with people and have limits on how I live was a no-no.

I took my time, found the perfect property. Shared block but freehold title. Only thing that was I needed to pay public liability insurance for the shared walkway on the property (split equally between owners). The real estate agent is local to my area, there's also about 3-degrees of separation between us, he has friends who are friends with my friends type of thing, didn't know him, but knew of him, so that sorta felt good too.

About 5 months after I move in I get a knock on the door from the owner (landlord) of the property next to me to discuss insurance. Not a problem, I ask for a copy of the policy so I have a record. It gets sent through and low and behold it's for strata insurance. I was incredibly confused and after much back and forth the property isn't a free hold title but a strata title. I called my lawyer who conveyed the title etc. He was dumbfounded but over it all did the right thing and made things as right as they could.

I arranged for a meeting with the real estate agent. I brought emails and printouts of the adds they had all saying it was free hold, emails between the real estate agent and my lawyer discussing it's freehold status, despite it being in absolute black and white he refused to accept any fault or offer anything to make things right. I don't begrudge that, he's looking out for himself, I get that. However I wouldn't forget it.

I did enter into mediation with the real estate agent and all I asked for was, when the time came for me to sell, they'd do it or cover the costs. I thought this was reasonable, but they flat out refused offered me 1k to go away, which I refused. I had the option to pursue them legally (and was advised by the mediator to do so) but ultimately I decided against it for a few reasons, the main one being my health at the time.

So I planned and plotted, and I schemed and connived as to how to get back at this son-of-a-bitch. And I settled on this.

I found his personal facebook page which wasn't set to private, saw some photos of a ""Boys on Tour"" trip he went on a few weeks prior (so about 5-6 months after I bought the property). I also found his address through a business registration search. On the anniversary of the sale, for 6 years straight, I sent them flowers with a note :-

""Dear Real Estate Agent  
Remembering you, on this, our special day.  
She has your eyes.  
Love Elle""

They varied ever so slightly over the years but always had ""on this our special day"" and some weird inference to a love child and a desire to reconnect.

I also from time to time arranged for postcards and letters to be sent from another country, the one he was ""On Tour"" in, always signed ""Love Elle"".

I learned about 3 weeks ago that this guy had recently divorced, lost his home and is not longer working as a real estate agent. His wife had found out he cheated on her. The story I was told (through said friends of friends) went along the lines of ""He would get weird gifts and flowers every year, same day, every year. She (his wife) finally put two and two together and realised what the date was and he admitted to cheating on her"".

ProRevenge,Dude that is some awesome revenge. Fuck that guy!,GuntherTheMonk,1850,Oh I played the long game ,"I am by no means an expert, or pro, at revenge but I am a patient person. I disclosed this to a friend and they directed me here. ThrowAway for obvious reasons, it's a long read but the setup and backstory are important.

7 years ago I was lucky enough to be able to buy my own place, I had saved for 10 years, worked my ass off, and I was so happy to be able to have a place to call my own.

Now, being a single person on the mortgage meant I had to make compromises, one such compromise was buying a property on a shared block (a lot cheaper). Where I'm from this usually means it's on a ""strata"" title. For some that's a bonus as it means there's a communal fund for repairs, typically insurance is cheaper as it's collective, and other things like maintenance being taken care of. Strata titles also come with a lot of by-laws and restrictions on what you can and can't do. I'm a pretty private and introverted person so having to deal with people and have limits on how I live was a no-no.

I took my time, found the perfect property. Shared block but freehold title. Only thing that was I needed to pay public liability insurance for the shared walkway on the property (split equally between owners). The real estate agent is local to my area, there's also about 3-degrees of separation between us, he has friends who are friends with my friends type of thing, didn't know him, but knew of him, so that sorta felt good too.

About 5 months after I move in I get a knock on the door from the owner (landlord) of the property next to me to discuss insurance. Not a problem, I ask for a copy of the policy so I have a record. It gets sent through and low and behold it's for strata insurance. I was incredibly confused and after much back and forth the property isn't a free hold title but a strata title. I called my lawyer who conveyed the title etc. He was dumbfounded but over it all did the right thing and made things as right as they could.

I arranged for a meeting with the real estate agent. I brought emails and printouts of the adds they had all saying it was free hold, emails between the real estate agent and my lawyer discussing it's freehold status, despite it being in absolute black and white he refused to accept any fault or offer anything to make things right. I don't begrudge that, he's looking out for himself, I get that. However I wouldn't forget it.

I did enter into mediation with the real estate agent and all I asked for was, when the time came for me to sell, they'd do it or cover the costs. I thought this was reasonable, but they flat out refused offered me 1k to go away, which I refused. I had the option to pursue them legally (and was advised by the mediator to do so) but ultimately I decided against it for a few reasons, the main one being my health at the time.

So I planned and plotted, and I schemed and connived as to how to get back at this son-of-a-bitch. And I settled on this.

I found his personal facebook page which wasn't set to private, saw some photos of a ""Boys on Tour"" trip he went on a few weeks prior (so about 5-6 months after I bought the property). I also found his address through a business registration search. On the anniversary of the sale, for 6 years straight, I sent them flowers with a note :-

""Dear Real Estate Agent  
Remembering you, on this, our special day.  
She has your eyes.  
Love Elle""

They varied ever so slightly over the years but always had ""on this our special day"" and some weird inference to a love child and a desire to reconnect.

I also from time to time arranged for postcards and letters to be sent from another country, the one he was ""On Tour"" in, always signed ""Love Elle"".

I learned about 3 weeks ago that this guy had recently divorced, lost his home and is not longer working as a real estate agent. His wife had found out he cheated on her. The story I was told (through said friends of friends) went along the lines of ""He would get weird gifts and flowers every year, same day, every year. She (his wife) finally put two and two together and realised what the date was and he admitted to cheating on her"".

Now, I didn't mean for this, but it turns out a year before I bought my house he had gone on holiday, came back with an STD, gave it to his wife but somehow convinced her that it wasn't him. As such ""our special day"" turned out to be right around the time he'd have been balls deep, sans condom, in someone who wasn't his wife, only one year earlier.

NuclearRevenge,This is the updated version. The old one was no longer usable.,claycam6,49751,About r/NuclearRevenge,"Welcome to Nuclear Revenge! Here, users will share personal extreme revenge stories that exceed the mild intent of most revenge, often in a ridiculous and even nefarious manner that will surely end badly for someone.

If you are wondering about the name of this subreddit. Nuclear Revenge is simply metaphorical. Resorting to the use of nuclear weapons would be a pretty extreme form of retaliation. And we are looking for some serious retaliation stories.

**Notice:**

1. This subreddit is not for those who are easily offended. If you feel the need to be rude to another user over the content in their story, please leave.
2. Do not ask to be a mod. We will make an announcement if we are looking for a new mod.
3. Moderators may still remove a post or a comment at their own discretion even if it does not directly violate any of our listed rules. Be mindful of what you say and do in this subreddit.
4. It's understandable if you're unsure of whether or not a story is suitable for this subreddit. If so, feel free to message the mods and we will help you determine if the story is suitable or not.

**Important Information:**

* Stories of getting revenge on a school bully violate Rule 2 and do not belong here. Do not post them.

I find that there is indeed a hacker in our server. He was using an app to anonymously control his bot network, among other things.

I looked at the app he was using, and discovered that it was an opensource project. I then downloaded the code for this backdoor, modified it to log everything to a file, and replaced his app with my honeypot version.

Over the next six months I collected every scrap of information I could on this guy. I then used that information to take over many of his online accounts, including his main email account. That was the account where he had registered all of his services to, so I was able to issue password reset requests for everything he owned. I gained control of six other email accounts, two dozen IRC accounts, his facebook page, his dating profile, numerous websites, and the backup site he used for his cell phone. I have his phone number, his moms number, and his girlfriends number. I know his address, his birthday, the schools he went to, even his favorite foods and music.

After I took every single online account he had ever had away from him, I sent a nasty email to his ISP in an effort to extort yet more information from them. In that email I said some very unkind things about the monarch of Indonesia and how I might smear the monarch publicly if I didn't get the information.

The hacker dispeared immediatly after that. I have looked for him at times over the last fifteen years since and he has not resurfaced. The Indonesian lèse-majesté laws regarding insults to the monarchy are not to be trifled with. The prison term for such an offense is 15 years.",1912,2024-09-30 19:00:06

It’s hair was matted, had mange, ridden with fleas, one eye swollen and sealed shut with mucus, nails so long it was walking on the back of its paws, malnourished, and quivering. I was shocked. 

I called my wife to bring me a blanket and come pick us up. While I was waiting, the door of the house in front of us opened, and out came a disheveled looking older man. He started calling for the dog to come inside. I absolutely lost it. I screamed at him asking if it was his dog and he replied it was. I asked him why it was in such bad shape and he said “she’s sick and won’t eat”. I yelled at him there was no fucking way in the world I was letting him take her back inside. The shouting match lasted long enough for a few neighbors to come outside. (Who later told me he had another dog in the house). Eventually my wife pulls up and I wrap the doggo in the blanket and go home. 

I looked up the name of our local no kill shelter but they were closed until the following day. My wife and I decided to call her Sally. I gave Sally a bath and went and bought some wet food since she wouldn’t eat dry kibble. She devoured it. I set her up a nice sleeping area in the garage for her to spend the night. 

1st thing in the morning I took Sally to the shelter and called animal control and told them what happened. They went to check her out, took a statement from me, and ended up at his house confiscating his other dog. Unfortunately Sally was put down due to the horrible shape it was in (she was also very old). 

Here’s where the revenge begins. 

This old assholes house was on the route I took to walk my dog twice a day. My dog liked to take a dump about two houses before we reached his. Perfect! Now I didn’t need to carry bags of shit all the way back to my house! I started tossing them on his roof twice a day. At first he would climb a ladder around once a week to get them down, but eventually I broke his will to do that. This went on for about a year before I moved. His roof was covered in shit bags. 

I also printed out flyers with his address and pictures of how I found Sally and put them in all the neighbors mailbox’s. 

I live across town now, but every couple months I ride by and toss a bag of dogshit on his roof to let him know I’m still thinking about Sally. ",1403,2024-09-22 18:24:32

My apartment had all utilities included in the monthly rent. But you did have to set up WiFi through a specific provider and give them the exact address so it could be billed properly, and call to cancel upon moving out. It was a quick, easy, cancellation, but figured it was a fluke since they’re familiar with the complex. 

I had to call and cancel WiFi services about 2 years ago, since I moved to my current house. This time, so much haggling. I finally just lied and said I was moving out of state and gave them a zip code I know they don’t provide to since I was so annoyed. It was only then that he relented and cancelled my service. 

So fast forward to now, me and my housemates  are switching WiFi services since we can get ridiculously better speeds for the same price as our old provider. When I called to cancel, I plainly said “I’m moving to a housing complex that requires us to use a specific service provider that isn’t you.”

And boom. No haggling. No “well would you like to stay with us for X service?” NOTHING. The call was only 5-ish minutes long and everything is in process. So, I highly recommend doing this. 

Some tips:
- You don’t have to provide them with any address, zip code, etc. Providers are not privy to that information unless you are just moving service. But it can speed up the process. 
- Search up the company’s coverage ahead of time. Pick a place that is in the middle of nowhere if you have to. Having the info at the ready is always good.
- Claim ALL residents are moving out. (Or that it’s just you.) They may ask if a different person wants to continue coverage and to transfer the billing. 
- You don’t have to give them a lease/moving date or anything of the sort. Just say you’re comfortable with whatever the shutoff date will be. This will stop any further monthly bills.
- If it’s a large utility (gas, water, electric) say you’re moving to a different state. Some large companies cover multiple states, but again, a quick google search can give you specific states if you want them.
- Many companies now link accounts through phone number. So if you’re canceling to attempt to get a “new customer” deal, make sure to use a roommate’s number that has never been associated with it.
- if they ask “are you sure”, say you’ve signed the lease and they are firm on a different company. Nothing more. 
- Make sure to pay the final bill if there is one. Otherwise they’ll be calling you or even blacklist you if you ever try to use them again.",520,2024-11-14 19:50:43

Looking for some advice on how to let my parents know that me, my  family and kids are looking to relocate back to my OH town, we have been in our town for 11 years now.

She came to study and ended up staying because of me. Fast forward and we now have 3 kids.

Every Friday her family travel down to look after the kids for us and ultimately they have an amazing relationship with them.

We have reached a point where our mortgage is due for renewal in June 2026 so still a good way off but that would be when we are looking to go.

I'm excited about the prospect of starting fresh, new job, new house, kids would be excited too.

Where we currently live we have my family close by but can still go 6 weeks without seeing them, and that's why I think it would be a great move as my OH family are so hands on. Retired etc so they have the time I guess.

My issue is how do I tell my mum and dad 

I have 2 brothers we speak daily so they'll be okay, I'll still travel down every few months so no difference really with how often I see them.

But it is giving me anxiety knowing I'll be sitting down to tell my mum and dad (divorced, mum remarried)

How would I best approach this? 

Anyone with any past experience.


Really been on my mind.

But I'm 100% that I want to relocate. I'm applying for jobs already etc to remotely work if possible too.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,"My thoughts.

1. I appreciate the mods efforts - I know it isn't easy to run a sub like this where you're getting pressure from the users on one side and Reddit on the other.

2. Reddit's policy as listed above, is obviously racist and sexist, based on its protected vs unprotected classes.  The same racist statement that will get you censored or banned becomes just fine and will probably be upvoted once you redirect it at white people.

3. Aside from sexism and racism, it is just bad all around.  In 1901, WEB Dubois, the first black Harvard PhD, earned in sociology, wrote a book called the Philadelphia Negro, in which he talked about the challenges facing the black community.  Not just this book, but any detailed discussion of its points would be banned on Reddit.

 For a more recent example, in  2008 as a Presidential candidate, Obama gave a father's day speech supported by statistics in which he specifically told black fathers that they needed to do more to improve the outcomes of their (black) children.  I believe this speech, or any detailed discussion of it, would be banned as well.

4. Having ""protected"" and ""unprotected"" classes will absolutely be abused and in fact I know it is already been abused by trans activists.  You should be on the lookout for people posting false and even sexist and racist arguments that, if you refute it, will get you banned.

 Trans example:  Someone says that trans children should be given puberty blockers.  Well, what exactly is a trans child?  You can't have that discussion, because it will invariably involve trying to figure out who is trans and who isn't.  (Even if you're a pediatrician, or it's your own child.)

 Race example:  Someone says white people are responsible for most hate crimes against asians.    Based on Reddits policies, virtually anything you do to try to refute this point will get you banned.

5. Complaining on reddit may be easy and might feel good but in the end it doesn't do much.  Contact your state attorney general, which is likely an elected position, and ask them if it is acceptable for a company to have a set of rules that protects certain sexes and races and not others to operate in their state.  For extra points, do it publicly, and let the opposing party know what you are doing, and they can use it in their election campaigns.",IanArcad,111553,IMPORTANT: We Need To Talk About The Content Policy...,"The Reddit Admins have messaged us and have brought it to our attention that several posts in violation of the Content Policy had been either gone unnoticed or were allowed to remain.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,"As with tons of political posts on these Unpopular Opinion subreddits, extremely unpopular on Reddit, extremely common opinion in the real world",FrozenFrac,73927,Most of Reddit Suffers from a Severe Case of Trump Derangement Syndrome ,"It’s honestly kind of wild how any mention of Trump—even a casual, unrelated comment—seems to set off a mental rage among a huge chunk of Redditors. It feels like every single thread on Reddit eventually spirals into bashing Trump, no matter the original topic. Sports? ""At least it's not as bad as Trump."" A cute animal video? ""Look at this doggo, unlike that orange idiot."" Cooking? ""Bet Trump can't even cook toast."" You get the idea.

It’s exhausting. I’m not even here to defend the guy—just pointing out that an entire platform can’t seem to break free from turning every discussion into a referendum on one person. And that’s not healthy. Let’s be real: whether you love or hate him, the obsession is on a level that’s not normal. It's like a weird Pavlovian reflex.

I get it, he is polarizing, but this reaction feels beyond politics and more like some weird collective fixation",527,2024-11-14 14:41:07
TrueUnpopularOpinion,It’s actually pretty amusing. Especially now that Trump blew the Democrats out of the water in both the EC and the popular vote as well as taking the Senate and the House like an OG gangster. ,FusorMan,15612,Most of Reddit Suffers from a Severe Case of Trump Derangement Syndrome ,"It’s honestly kind of wild how any mention of Trump—even a casual, unrelated comment—seems to set off a mental rage among a huge chunk of Redditors.
