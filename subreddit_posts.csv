ChangeMyView,Meta: r/changemyview is recruiting new moderators,"It's that time of the year folks. We're looking to expand our team of volunteers that help keep this place running. If you're passionate about changing views through thoughtful discourse, what better way can there be to contribute to that than help to keep a community like this as a smoothly oiled machine? We're not looking for a fixed number of new moderators, generally we like to take things by eye and accept as many new mods as we have good applications. Ideal candidates will have...

* A strong history of good-faith participation on CMV (delta count irrelevent).

* Understanding of our rules and why they're setup the way they are.

Please do note though:

Moderating this subreddit is a significant time commitment (minimum 2-3 hours per week). It's rewarding and in my opinion very worthy work, but please only apply if you are actually ready to participate.

ChangeMyView,CMV: The people who entered the capital on jan6th are terrorists and should be treated like terrorists. ,"I need help... I'm feeling anxious about the future. With Joey’s son now off the hook, I believe the Trump team will use this as an opportunity to push for the release of the January 6 rioters currently in jail. I think this sets a terrible precedent for future Americans.

The view I want you to change is this: I believe that the people who broke into the Capitol should be treated as terrorists. In my opinion, the punishments they’ve received so far are far too light (though at least there have been some consequences). The fact that the Republican Party downplays the event as merely “guided tours” suggests they’ll likely support letting these individuals off with just a slap on the wrist.

To change my mind, you’ll need to address what is shown in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DfLbrUa5Ng&t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DfLbrUa5Ng&t=2s) It provides evidence of premeditation, shows rioters breaking into the building, engaging in violence, and acting in coordination. Yes, I am grouping everyone who entered the building into one group. If you follow ISIS into a building to disrupt a government anywhere in the world, the newspaper headline would read, “ISIS attacks government building.”

(Please don’t bring up any whataboutism—I don’t care if other groups attacked something else at some point, whether it’s BLM or anything else. I am focused solely on the events of January 6th. Also, yes, I believe Trump is a terrorist for leading this, but he’s essentially immune to consequences because of his status as a former president and POTUS. So, there’s no need to discuss him further.)",290,0.63,596,Imthewienerdog,2024-12-02 20:10:54,1h5cmbq
ChangeMyView,CMV: communal living should be more mainstream to combat unaffordable housing ,"For most of human history, we always lived with a tribe or village. It only changed in the last 300 or so years. And I don't think it's working. All over the globe, it's getting harder and harder to be able to get a mortgage for a house. 

The nuclear family unit is not working as well. It takes a village to raise a child. Asking just mom and dad to raise children with not much from the local community is putting to much on their shoulders. 

I have been thinking rather then buying a house for a nuclear family, and take on stress paying the mortgage. What if small communities get together, everyone pitch in towards the mortgage. The healthy look after the children and elderly. Just like our ancestors did.

The only drawback is loss of privacy and some level of freedom. But if it means having closer relationships with other humans, and having more people to help you raise your kids, it might be worth it imo.

Thoughts?

ChangeMyView,CMV: Forced conscription is inherently wrong,"This is a topic that recently came up again in the context of the Ukraine war so here's my take: Forcing people into frontline service is inherently and always immoral. I have a few reasons for believing this 

1. Sending someone into war with 2 weeks of training is very likely to get that person killed. So knowingly doing so is essentially equivalent to manslaughter

2. It's a violation of bodily autonomy

3. The state should serve the people and not the other way around. The reason why a state exists is to enable large numbers of people to live together in relative peace and prosperity.

self,I did it. I (45M) left her (52f). ,"I'm not sure why I'm feeling compelled to get this out into the world, but here it is. 

I started dating my best friend about 3 months ago. Before getting romantic, this person was my #1 go-to confidante for over 10 years. She was who I called when things were at their worst...she really was my 'ride or die' as they say.

When I decided to rent my house out and spend a year as a digital nomad, she indicated her interest in me and we decided to see what would happen if we tried dating. 

Initially it was pretty great. Especially the first month...it was pretty blissful. But, I knew the luster would wane eventually. I just didn't think it would happen like this. 

We started arguing a few weeks ago. Within seconds, a peaceful evening alone together would erupt into a bitter, no-holds-barred insult fest, and I knew this couldn't be sustainable. 

Then, one night about a week ago, after one such argument, she physically prevented me from leaving the house by blocking my car in with hers and refusing to move it. 

I've never been so terrified of my partner. My lover. My best friend. 

I knew in that moment that I had to engineer a way out of this, or it would only get worse. 

And so, after we returned from our Thanksgiving trip together, in the wake of yet another argument over something minor, I grabbed my keys, packed my things, and left. 

This happened yesterday, and I'm steadily driving farther and farther west, into the desert, where I am going to be alone for a few weeks while I reorient myself and figure out what I'm going to do next. 

It just sucks because not only have I lost a romantic relationship, but now my best friend is an enemy, and that hurts much more. 

The open road calls...so with a heavy heart, I push forward. 

I hear Arizona is beautiful this time of year.

There was lots of loud music and dancing and I met some cool people. Because of the loud music you had to get really close and kind of talk into people's ears to be heard. I chatted with one guy (32m) a lot and he seemed nice, then we parted ways to go to different floors. Later that night we bumped into each other again, danced some more and then he put my arm around his waist and told me he finds me very attractive. I told him that I am in a relationship, and stepped back. He said what a shame, apologized, smiled and we went our seperate ways again. It was such a mature interaction, just the way such things should be handled, I'm still thinking about it just because it was so wholesome.

This means OPs cannot hint at or ask for money, and community members cannot offer money or food. There are local services that can verify and address a person's situation better than any of us can (and many services will not turn people away if they are asking for it). A kind community member offered a scammer a job and that is okay.

This community is read by millions of people, and scammers around the world know this. We have cultivated an empathic community so we know it can be hard to resist offering material help. It takes only one person to make it worth it because it costs nothing to post. That is why the rules are strictly enforced.

There are many signs of a scammer. They will present a financially desperate situation often with a highly emotional component. They are likely to mention payment services. They may have payment services in their Reddit profile and ask people to look at their profile. They will ask people to privately message them. All of these behaviors may be obfuscated with weird spacing and other ways to evade detection. If they evade detection it's up to the community to report it. Do not call out OPs, report only.

offmychest,My boyfriend spoiled the Christmas present he got for me and it made me cry,"We were sending reels to each other on Instagram before falling asleep last night. Out of the blue he(28M) told me he has always been terrible at hiding surprises and wanted to tell me (27F) what he got me. This is our first christmas together and he already knows what I'm doing for him so I figured why not, and I don't mind surprises.
He gave me the opportunity to guess, and gave me the hint that it was something that could not be wrapped. Ideally I'd like for him to be here since we are long distance for now but I was pretty stumped aside from that as a possibility.
He then sent me a screenshot for a private horseback trail ride for 2. I was overcome with emotions because for the first time in my life I found someone that quietly listens. I never explicitly said this was something I wanted but he saw my interests. He saw the things I got excited about and found something we could experience together and is *excited* to do these things with me.

offmychest,My brother has rejected me on/off all my life and this year he didn't invite me to the family Thanksgiving until hours beforehand.,"I grew up the youngest of 3 siblings. They were both 8+ years older than me so they were used to bossing me around. 

Growing up, my brother shut himself off from the family. He would on rare occasions, invite me to play video-games with him or take me to a movie with his girlfriend but usually he was just yelling out for me to come close his door or shut off his light when he was too lazy to get up. Me, wanting to be a people-pleaser, did it. 

As we aged, he became the ""funny guy"" and now he has lots of friends in his circle who all love him and think he's the greatest guy on the planet. I'm still a shy quiet reserved guy. He has no problem using me as the target of his jokes, or just plain ignoring me at family get-togethers. 

After years of this, I realized I was never gonna have his acceptance as a peer, and I just stopped caring about having any kind of relationship with him. 

A cruel trick of the universe is that he ended up having a child (my niece) who I love. Of my nieces/nephews (counting my sister's kids too) she's possibly the one I get along with the best. I'm married and don't live super-far away but still too far to see my nieces/nephew frequently, so I started scheduling days every couple months where I could take my niece/nephew (my sister's son) to an arcade or movie or other activity. My sister was okay communicating with me and communicating when my nephew was too busy. When my niece was busy, my brother was either rude about turning me down, saying something like ""she's going out of town"" and ignoring my follow-up questions, or just plain out ignoring me. (The last time I tried to schedule a day, I received no response back. My sister-in-law immediately spouted ""I didn't reply to you!"" the next time I saw her so they hadn't missed it.....I hadn't realized my niece has expensive ballet lessons that day and ignoring me was less of a hassle than letting me know she's unavailable)

For my niece's birthday in August 2024, we ended up going to a restaurant with some of my brother/sister-in-law's friends. My brother didn't want to pay for everyone so he told us all to pay separately. I offered and paid for my mom, dad, sister, and nephew. (practically half the party) We went to the circus afterwards and my brother rudely told me to move because we had to make room for some of his friends in the section and he ignored me when I asked him to repeat himself. 

For Thanksgiving 2024, I had spoken with my mom who made it clear my brother was planning dinner. She had asked him if I'd been invited and my brother had just shrugged and said his wife is inviting people. I told my Mom I hadn't received an invitation. The day before Thanksgiving, I spoke with my mom and she said Thanksgiving was on. I repeated that I hadn't been invited. My mom had brought it up to my brother and sister-in-law, who said that they had invited me a long time ago. My brother told her to invite me again. 

The day of Thanksgiving, my brother sent me an invitation in the morning saying the dinner plans. I told him I was aware my mom had asked them more than once to invite me but I had never received any word. I already had other plans. My brother said ""*His wife* sent it to the wrong person! See you for Christmas!"" I did not reply. 

Thanksgiving night, my sister tried calling me twice and my brother tried calling me once, probably because my mom suggested for them to call me as a group to wish me a happy holiday. I ignored the calls. My brother just sent me a text saying ""call your mother."" I ignored it. 

A few months ago, my sister-in-law had invited me and my wife to go watch my niece in a ballet recital. It's scheduled for this Saturday. I would love to go and see it, especially as my niece had even called me to talk about how excited she is for the role, but I feel like I'd just be rewarding my brother after I was snubbed from the family Thanksgiving and didn't even get an apology. I'm leaning towards not going, and I feel like I'd look silly even showing up for Christmas at this point.",336,0.98,44,TheCrazyMonk,2024-12-02 13:36:09,1h53krz

personalfinance,"30-Day Challenge #12: Get involved with charity! (December, 2024)","# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Get involved with charity!** As the end of the year approaches, there are many opportunities to extend oneself to be generous. The best advice is to ""secure your own oxygen mask first"" before helping others. The foundation of your generosity should be a [solid financial footing for yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics). Until you have achieved this, you should be circumspect about monetary giving.

# Monetary donations

If you have the means, consider monetary donations as these are the most efficient use of your charitable resources. Don't spend money to buy material goods that you intend to donate unless they are specifically requested by the charity itself. Cash donations allow for flexibility for the charity to get exactly what is needed at the right time in the right quantity at the right place to serve their mission.

Make sure you are contributing to charities that are good stewards of your hard-earned dollars by checking [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/), [Give Well](https://www.givewell.org/), or another trusted source. If you do decide to donate cash, see if your employer matches contributions to extend the benefit. You may also consider donating to a charity that has assisted you or your loved ones in the past.

# Material donations

December is a great month in which to declutter your home, especially if you are participating in one of the many gift-giving holidays. Review your living space to determine what you can part with and how you can enjoy the reclaimed space. You can donate material goods to [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.habitat.org/), [Goodwill industries](https://www.goodwill.org/), [AmVets](http://amvets.org/), and local options near you such as food pantries.

# Time donations

Of course with all the donations coming in at this time of year, many organizations will need volunteers to help with the influx. If you are unable to donate money or material goods, you can consider donating your time. You can use [Volunteer Match](https://www.volunteermatch.org/) or [Catch a Fire](https://www.catchafire.org/) to get you started. There may also be local soup kitchens, churches, schools, or other organizations that need assistance.

# Alternative donations

There are other ways to be charitable if you don't have spare money, goods, or time. Here are some ideas:

* When making Amazon purchases, use the [Amazon smile program](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/chpf/about/ref=smi_se_dshb_aas_saas) to donate a portion of your purchase to a designated charity at no additional cost to you.
* Check with your local markets and grocers to see if they have programs such as [Kroger’s Community Rewards](https://www.kroger.com/topic/kroger-community-rewards-3) to direct donations to local charities.
* Keep an eye out for local restaurants and cafés that will donate a percentage of proceeds to charitable organizations, and patronize them during an eligible time period (schools are frequent beneficiaries of such programs).
* The [Make-a-wish foundation](http://wish.org/ways-to-help/giving/airline-miles), the [Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org/donations/ways-to-donate/donate-airline-miles), and [Miles for Migrants](https://www.miles4migrants.org/) all accept donations of airline miles.
* You may be able to donate hotel or resort points. Contact the relevant hospitality group for details.
* You can elect to donate credit card rewards to charity.
* If your health and personal philosophy allow, consider becoming a blood/plasma donor or [registering for bone marrow donation](https://bethematch.org/). You can also consider registering as an organ donor and revising your will to donate your body to research after you pass.

# Taxes

Qualified charitable contributions remain [tax-deductible under the new tax law in the US](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/charitable-contributions/charitable-contributions/L6ZyAXJ4Y), but realizing a reduction in taxes is more difficult because of the increase in the standard deduction. If this is a significant factor for you, you may want to consider more advanced tax reduction strategies such as [donor advised funds](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/996iam/an_analysis_of_charitable_giving_using_donor/), [giving appreciated stock](https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Donors-Often-Overlook-Benefits/152705), or [bunching your donations](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/itemize-bunching-tax-deductions.html) to meet the itemization threshold.

# Receiving charity

If you are in need this year, please consider being the good-faith recipient of a charity's assistance. 

# Challenge success criteria

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done one of the following things:

* Donated money, goods, or time to a charity or organization.
* Made an alternative donation or plans to donate.
* Received charitable assistance if in need.",6,0.8,1,IndexBot,2024-12-01 07:00:07,1h42rbg

personalfinance,What’s the deal with the “10% yearly growth accounts” people are all apparently putting their money in?,"To start, I am stupid when it comes to finances. The only thing I'm good at is not spending my money recklessly. I'm 26M with just over 30k put away and it is currently sitting in a money market account through fidelity.

I keep seeing different social media finance people (I know not a great source) saying people put their money in accounts that grow 10% per year etc etc, I am just wondering is that a legit thing? Sounds a little too good to be true.

I'm already saving for retirement and have been since 18, so just curious on what the best way to grow my savings would be. ",238,0.82,149,PlsFixItsUrgent,2024-12-02 16:53:55,1h58d8j
personalfinance,Should we sell our house that we just purchased?,"Throwaway account.

My wife and I just bought a house (our first) four months ago. We were renting the house for about 5 years and the owner made us a deal to purchase the house for their remaining mortgage amount. We bought the house for $168,000 and it appraised for $245,000. I believe, with some touching up, it could sell for closer to $260,000 based on similar houses that sold on the same street/neighborhood. The house is approximately 15 years old.

I am the sole income provider and made ~$52k last year... we are struggling to make the payments. In fact, we aren't making the payments really. We had $10k in savings and are now down to $6k. My monthly payment is $1500 and that includes insurance and property tax. Our intrest rate is 5.8% and this is our only debt.

I should be getting another raise in the next few weeks (annual review) but I know better than to count on that. I'm also hoping the intrest rates improve but know I can't count on that either. My wife will likely return work next year part time but that wont be until our youngest child starts school.

Our budget shows on paper that we could tighten our belts and potentially be in the black $100 a month. I feel like that is cutting it too close. My gut is telling me that I should list the house for sale January (6 months into our mortgage) and find an older/cheaper home. Realistically we could find another home for $140,000-$160,000, use the money from the sale to make the downpayment and have a significant chunk of change leftover. I'm hesitant for a few reasons: we both really like the area we are in now, I've never done anything like this before (usually pay cash for my vehicles), and I'm not sure how taxes/capital gains would work. Someone, not a reliable source, said we wouldn't pay a capital gains tax because of our income. We are in Mississippi.

We should have $2000-$4000 back on our tax return and I have an older extra vehicle I could sell for $3,000 if I had to. I'm trying not to rely on either of those as capital but in my mind those are extra house payments I could use in an emergency. Another point, potentially, is after selling this house and getting into another one I could use the leftover cash to jump start my retirement. I'm currently 34 and have nothing except my savings listed above.

I hope that is enough information and that it all makes sense. I kind of layed awake last night in a panic after we went over our budget. This post was made entirely with stress as its main motivation.

Thank you for any advice.


Edit - I definitely appreciate all of the responses even if I didn't respond directly I'd like to thank all of you. We do have two small children, this is the oldest first year in school and the youngest starts next year. It was cheaper for my wife to stay home than to pay childcare for two young children. Than plan was always for her to return to work when the youngest started school and we are going to try and accelerate that.

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/198hzvn/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxv/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

AskScience,How does sound travel so consistently through the air when air is constantly moving?,"So, sound is pressure waves moving through the air. But the air is moving anyway, especially outdoors.

AskScience,Can any two-dimensional maze be solved with water pressure?,"A two-dimensional maze is laid on the floor. This maze is like one you might find in a kids coloring book. It has an entrance and exit, and a single path can be drawn to the exit. Instead of paths, this maze is composed of water pipes.

Suppose the maze is entirely filled with water and the entrance is attached to a pressurized water hose. In a small maze, the water would flow to and out the exit and complete the path. The water pressure ""solved"" the maze.

Is there a size of maze where the water pressure is not enough to solve? Can the maze be infinitely spread across the floor? Can it scale up as long as there is enough water pressure? Is there a point where no amount of water pressure would be enough?",80,0.78,108,Bobula_Rossa,2024-12-02 11:26:13,1h50cg6

Writing,"Young writers, please pay attention!","Young writers, please pay attention!

When posting here, especially if you're a minor, do not say it. Don't give your age, don't indicate how young you might be. The internet is a dangerous place and there are people everywhere who will act in bad faith and use that knowledge to their advantage. If you're new to writing, then that's all you need to really mention, leave any age indicators out of it.

The amount of posts I've seen recently with young kids just freely giving their ages out is insane to me. I've seen an 11 year old in this sub asking for assistance before. I grew up in an age where it was drilled repeatedly into our heads just how dangerous the internet is and to not give away information. This needs to be brought back.

I'm not saying all this to bust your balls boys and girls. Even when I was younger and didn't share my age, I still had people try and pull shit with me because they somehow figured out I was a minor at the time. You guys need to be careful and protect yourself as best as you can in this increasingly super connected digital age. Please stop sharing your ages and be safe!

Advice,My partner said I love you to someone else,"I 28(M), just had my partner 29(F) of 6 years tell me that she told another man “I love you”, let’s call him Tim. 

Tim and my partner met at their workplace, they’ve grown very close over the last year. He’s professed his love for her in the past, but she has not said confessed anything to him in the past. Tim once again this weekend confessed his love and how this has affected him. After, they cried together, talked and held hands. She assures me nothing more has happened, and I fully believe her, we are very open with everything in our relationship.

I can see they have a great friendship and connection, and generally Tim is a nice and respectful guy. 

This came as a full surprise to me, and truly rocked me when she told me what had happened and been said. I was not expecting for my partner to confess her love for him. 

In my mind, it seems possible to love more than one person, and I too am attracted to other people, however I never act on it, nor allow for those feelings to develop. 

I don’t know what to do now, even though nothing physical has happened between them, I still feel like I’ve been emotionally cheated on. My partner still deeply loves me, and assures me that she still wishes to be with me. 

I don’t know what to do now. I feel like I have two options, either to break up with her, or to continue in the relationship, it just feels different now that she has also confessed her love for someone else.

Any advice?",228,0.76,636,Grouchy-Medicine-348,2024-12-02 14:02:44,1h548bq
Advice,Girl I lost my virginity to (used a condom) reached out to me 10 years later and wants me to take a DNA test to see if her son is mine. ,"I was shook when she asked me. I knew she had a kid but I thought she knew who the father was?? Stop communicating shortly after we hooked up and never heard from her again. I have a family and 2 year old son already. I feel like it’s not fair to wait this long to say/do anything about it. How do I react to this


Edit: First of all thank you for the advice, and support. It is definitely overwhelming to be blindsided by this.

For added context this woman slept around with numerous men (we were young) and I mean numerous. Things kind of just happened and my buddy talked me into hooking up with her since I was still a virgin. Long story short she is married now. And her husband “is and always will be the father of 10yo” but the kid has questions about who his real dad is and the mom feels like it’s her responsibility to find out who the dad is for the kids sake. Apparently she never cared to find out who the father is until just recently. She took it upon herself that she was going to be a single mom and raise this kid by herself with her parents help and didn’t want to reach out and try to find the dad. (IMO she honestly doesn’t haven’t a clue who the dad could be and was probably embarrassed) but has already asked a large amount of people to take a DNA test.

Advice,How can I be a good parent if All I know is trauma?,"
I am a 25yo f I will give birth to my first child next month but the problem is that I went through a lot of trauma and horrible experiences as a child. 

My mom treated me so horribly (let her bf Molest me, she would beat me up for it) my dad was absent. I went from home to home(horrible caregivers) until I turned 18 and moved on my own. 

I have made a list of things that I think would be make a good parent to a child. I would like to know your thoughts. Did I miss something or if you want to add anything to this list?do you disagree with some of these?




1. Be there always.
2. Never yell or hit my child.
3. Hug and kiss my child often.
4. Tell my child I love him often.
5. Never fight/argue with his dad in front/near him.
6. Be kind and empathetic to my child.
7. Protect my child from certain people and/or certain behaviors from people.
8. Allow my child to express themselves (ideas,thoughts) without interrupting or correcting them.
9. Play and actively participate in activities with my child.
10. Never be sarcastic, rude, or aggressive towards my child.
11. Never confront my child for their bad behavior in front of others to avoid embarrassing them and talk to them calmly and kindly explain why the behavior is bad.
12. Allow my child to express their emotions  and tell them it’s okay to feel their feelings but shouldn’t express them in certain ways (hitting/yelling objects,people,animals) and explain why.
13. If my child makes a mistake or accidentally breaks something give him a smile and make them feel safe. Calmly and respectfully request they be more careful next time.
14. Smile at my child always.
15. Be respectful towards my child.
16. Explain to my child that no matter what I will always love him unconditionally.
17. It’s okay to cry and that I cry sometimes too that everyone cries when they are sad. 
18. Teach my child how to properly express their feelings. Angry? Sad? Anxious?happy? Breathing, talking to someone, journaling, working out, meditation..
19. Never dismiss my child’s concerns.
20. If my child has a question/s and I don’t know the answer calmly say I’m not sure but I will find out and get back to them. (Maybe even have a journal specifically to write down all the questions he may have)
21. Teach my child boundaries and teach him that he is not expected to hug anyone regardless if they are family or not (“where’s my hug”) 
22. Explain to my child what it means to be respectful vs submissive. (Essentially I want my child to not feel obligated to obey a stranger/family member/ friend to do something that doesn’t make him feel safe or he doesn’t feel comfortable doing. Yet he can still be respectful:(“no thank you”) also there’s a difference between being polite and doing something that feels wrong.
23. Manners (please, thank you)
24. Never allow anyone to insult, physically or mentally harm, belittle, or speak rudely to my child. And teach them exactly how to defend themselves verbally and physically.
25. Let my child know he must tell me if anyone makes them feel bad/unsafe/weird feeling or if anyone touched them in their private parts or touched them inappropriately. Teach them what to look out for. Explain that if someone says “do not tell mommy” he absolutely needs to tell me even if they say something like “if you tell mommy I’m going to harm you, mommy or daddy) tell them they are lying and he must tell me regardless of what they say.
26. Reassure my child that I will always protect him, love him, and be there for him no matter his age, situation, the mood I am in, the time, etc…
27. Always listen to my child without interrupting or giving unwanted advice. I may ask if he wants to know my opinion/advice. If not, then I will let him solve his problems on his own without resentment and explain that if he does want advice in the future I will always be there for him.
28. Teach him to be grateful for everything they have.
29. Teach him to treat women with respect.",119,0.94,127,Tasty-Candidate-8640,2024-12-02 14:46:34,1h55arp

LetsNotMeet,Human Trafficking Facts and Stats,"Hi, everyone. Due to the nature of this subreddit and because it's a hot button topic on social media in general, we receive a *lot* of posts and comments about encounters being possible human trafficking.



Unfortunately, there is a massive amount of misinformation about what human trafficking is and isn't, and the vast majority of these interactions here in this subreddit and elsewhere on social media are not how trafficking typically occurs.



# **What is human trafficking, anyway?**



Human trafficking is the exploitation ([thanks to u/officialfourloko for pointing this out!](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/16t9o8w/human_trafficking_facts_and_stats/k2ub7cp/)) of people through coercion, deception, force and any combination of those three, for sex, labor, or both. Human trafficking DOES NOT usually occur by spotting some girl alone out and about, following her and kidnapping her or ""tagging"" her to kidnap later. For sex trafficking in particular, the people trafficked almost *always* know and often times love or trust the person that trafficked them. 



Human trafficking is, disgustingly, a business, and it'd be bad for business to grab some random girl that might have a rich family to look for her, and to do so in front of witnesses. While there have been a few cases of trafficking that have occurred that way (it's sensational and scary, or we wouldn't know about it), it is by far the exception and not the rule. You are more likely to be trafficked by a romantic partner than anyone else.


# **How it happens**


""The most pervasive myth about human trafficking is that it often involves kidnapping or physically forcing someone into a situation. In reality, most traffickers use psychological means such as, tricking, defrauding, manipulating or threatening victims into providing commercial sex or exploitative labor. Another myth is that traffickers target victims they don't know. Many survivors have been trafficked by romantic partners, including spouses, and by family members, including parents."" - Polaris Project



""Perpetrators of human trafficking span all racial, ethnic, and gender demographics and are as diverse as survivors. Some use their privilege, wealth, and power as a means of control while others experience the same socio-economic oppression as their victims. They include individuals, business owners, members of a gang or network, parents or family members of victims, intimate partners, owners of farms or restaurants, and powerful corporate executives and government representatives."" - Polaris Project


# **Recent Statistics**


Based on data* from the [2021 National Report](https://humantraffickinghotline.org/en/resources/2021-national-report) by The Human Trafficking Hotline:



* **72% of trafficking is for sex**, 10% is for forced labor, 4% is for both sex and labor, with the remaining 14% being for unspecified purposes.



* 62% of sex trafficking victims are adults, **28% are minors**. In some cases, demographic information is not provided to the hotline, which is why the percentage here doesn't add up to 100%.



* 84% of sex trafficking victims are female, 8% are male, with the remaining 8% having another gender identity, defined as someone who identifies as any identity other than cisgender male or female.



In the vast majority of cases (88%), the country of origin of victims was unknown. When the country of origin *was* known, the majority of victims were US citizens. 



*note: this data is all from substantiated tips received by the hotline from January 1, 2021 until December 31, 2021, most of which came from victims themselves. 


#  **Additional Info & Sources**

LetsNotMeet,What Belongs Here,"I'm getting real sick of people getting shitty over their stories being removed, so here's a list of stories that inarguably belong here. If you read this thread and you have a story, compare it to any of these. If it wouldn't fit in with this list of stories, *it does not belong on this subreddit.* Usually if you're not sure if a story belongs here, it doesn't. 


1. [They stalked all the stay at home moms](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/7bhjfl/they_stalked_all_the_stay_at_home_moms) - I don't think I need to explain why this fits. I know there is some skepticism in the comments, but as OP was interactive with them prior to deleting her account (typically creative writing pieces OP doesn't respond to many, if any, comments), I think it's okay to leave up. 

2. [This happened quite a long time ago yet it is never too far from my mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/gi7emq/this_happened_quite_a_long_time_ago_yet_it_is) - this fits because although OP made it out unharmed and nothing really happened, the insistence of ""coming up here"" and the fact the creeper left *surgical shears* where they are not needed pushes this story into ""out of the ordinary"" 

3. [No good deed goes unpunished](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1g3x4f/no_good_deed_goes_unpunished) - Here is an example of a car story that would actually remain up. It takes place almost entirely in the car, but it is not someone just following her, or road raging and she goes home physically unharmed. This would be terrifying to go through. (Side note: this is also one of my favorite stories of all time as I love it when assholes like this get their due comeuppance) 

4. [I was a victim of sex trafficking](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/p1bmel/i_was_a_victim_of_sex_trafficking) - this is a real story about actual human trafficking. If you ""think"" you escaped human trafficking, most likely you didn't. Human trafficking overwhelmingly does not happen the way most people think it does, the reality is truly insidious and horrifying. 

5. [The office in the middle of nowhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1t2uwq/the_office_in_the_middle_of_nowhere) - I don't think I really need to explain this one either, I just wanted an example for the ""found something creepy/bizarre"" category. 


As a reminder, stories posted in this subreddit should have been life threatening (stories 1 and 3), extremely unusual/uncommon (stories 2 and 4) or about a time when you stumbled upon something excessively creepy (story 5). 


# What does not belong here? 

* You *think* you were followed because somebody was acting weird but you didn't interact much, if at all and eventually they either gave up or you lost them with minimal effort on your part (so didn't have to hide/confront them) 

* You can't say for certain what someone's intentions were, you can only guess at what they were doing or planning. 

* Being harassed/stared at/catcalled. I understand how frightening and enraging this is, but if you're a woman and you live in any moderately sized city or larger, you will have experienced this. It's entirely too common to be worthy of a story here. That doesn't change the fact it's threatening, disgusting, disrespectful behavior, but this subreddit is meant to focus on, again, life-threatening encounters.
 * an additional note here: stories containing excessive detail about your personal appearance will be removed, even if they fit the standards for this sub. It's a harmful belief to perpetuate in multiple directions that only conventionally attractive people get creeped on - anyone can be harassed on the street. Oftentimes what you look like has little, if anything to do with it, it's the loser's complete lack of regard and view of you as a person and (and for women, lack of respect for us) that causes them to harass you. If our appearance mattered that much for it, 11/12 year olds that look very much like children to anyone with an ounce of brain matter would not get catcalled. 

* The encounter didn't happen to you, but happened to your mother, sister, father, friend, aunt, etc. 

I reserve the right to edit this post to add/remove stories as I see fit, as well as adjust formatting. I suppose we could use this post as well for any comments/suggestions for the sub, cuz why not.

Edit: if you're just gonna bitch that this sub is tOo StRiCt you're wasting your time. Nothing in that regard will be changing.",204,0.99,31,fortunesoulx,2024-02-20 08:29:14,1aviy1c
LetsNotMeet,"He Lived in My House...
","Hi, this is the first time I’m sharing something here, so I hope my story will be easy to understand (by the way, this isn’t my account).

For privacy reasons, I won’t give my name or age.

For a bit of context, this happened about two years ago, a few weeks after my little brother was born. Ever since we moved into this house, there’s been this small room in the basement that’s always locked. To show you how little anyone uses it, I don’t even know what’s in there, but I’ve always assumed it’s just utility stuff like meters or something. The room is really tiny, barely big enough to lie down in.

Now, let’s get into it. My parents went away for a weekend together, leaving me, my older sister, and my baby brother (who was just a few weeks old at the time) at home. My parents trusted us to take care of ourselves since they’d done this before. Anyway, that night my sister went out with friends and wasn’t planning to come back until 4 or 5 in the morning. I watched a good movie and, since it was already getting late, I decided to put my little brother to bed in his room upstairs. I did that and came back down to watch another movie, but I ended up falling asleep.

About two or three hours later, around midnight, I woke up to these strange noises coming from upstairs. At first, I thought it was just the neighbors since they can be pretty loud and the walls are thin. But then I looked at the time and realized it was too late for them to still be awake, let alone making that kind of noise. So, I got closer to the stairs to investigate, and just as I was about to go up the first step, I heard the sound of something metal falling on the ground. Guess what? It was the key to the small room in the basement.

I immediately grabbed my phone, and instead of calling the police, I texted my friends to tell them what was happening. One of my friends had the brilliant idea of calling the police for me. Suddenly, I heard the bathroom door slam shut. I knew it was that door because it makes a very specific creaking noise when it closes. I remembered my brother was sleeping upstairs, so I carefully went up to check if he was okay. Thankfully, he was fine.

Still not fully grasping how much danger I was in, I went to the bathroom door. Since it opens inward, I decided to violently push it open—and I heard a man scream. I immediately shut the door and held it closed to keep him from getting out. He broke the window, and outside the bathroom, there’s this sort of balcony—not a proper one, but you get the idea—that connects to the balconies of the neighboring houses, which are all really close together. He used that to escape.

I grabbed my brother in my arms, ran to the kitchen, and noticed that one of the knives was missing from the knife block. I picked up another knife and crouched in a corner of the living room, crying like never before. The police arrived, and I opened the door for them.

When they searched the house, they confirmed that the bathroom window was broken, and I had hit the guy so hard that there was blood on the floor. But the most shocking and traumatizing part was what they found in that small basement room. There were blankets and cans of food. They concluded that he had been living there for several days...

LetsNotMeet,Man hiding in my porch,"About 2 nights ago I went to see the new Wicked movie with my family who was in town for Thanksgiving. I arrived back to my house around midnight. 

I live alone in a shared but divided house, with 2 other tenants living inside. One is upstairs and one splits the downstairs with me so there’s 3 apartments total. My place is in the back of the house and has a back porch you can enter through  after walking up the whole driveway.

When I got home, I sat in my bedroom and did about 20-30 minutes of work on my computer. During this time, the house was very quiet and I kept hearing a man’s voice continuously talking. Now, keep in mind, the tenant above me is a man and I know his bedroom is right above mine because I previously lived up there. It sounded like he was talking on the phone, just because of how long and continuous the talking went on. I tried to listen and figure out where the voice was coming from and I couldn’t exactly pinpoint it, but it was either coming from through the ceiling or on other side of my room. Now, it must be noted that my bedroom connects to the porch with a door that I have blocked with my dresser. There’s a main door inside the porch that you use to get into the house but there’s also this strange door connecting to my room.

I couldn’t make out the words, but because of how firm and continuous the voice was going on, I figured it just had to be coming from my housemate upstairs. It’s the only thing that made logical sense. I just kept on thinking though, I had never heard a single voice come through that ceiling before. It’s not that thin. Whatever, I’m worrying about nothing. 

After about 20-30 minutes of computer work, I got up to go to brush my teeth, feed my fish, get ready for bed, etc. I come back into my room , turn off the lights and get in bed. Keep in mind it’s been about 45-60 minutes since I first heard the voice and I could still hear it. Damn, I thought. My housemate is chatting up a storm on the phone up there. Oh, how wrong I was! 

After about 3 minutes of laying in bed, I all of the sudden heard my porch door creaking along with the talking mans voice. It has a very distinct sound that I knew immediately was my porch door. I crept across my room and put my ear to the dresser/the door that connects to the porch. Sure enough, the talking was coming from inside my porch and I could hear the door moving and shuffling inside my porch along with it. My heart absolutely dropped. 

All the lights were off in my house at this point, so I had a sort of sneaky advantage to creep around my house and get a view of what was going on. I crept down my hallway and peered into the kitchen, which the porch leads into. Across the kitchen, through the door and in a streak of moonlight, I just see a man with long , scraggly hair sitting curled up in the center of my porch turned around with his back to me, muttering out loud to himself and rocking back and forth. My fight or flight kicked in and I immediately ripped open the door and started screaming at him to get out and try intimidating him. Looking back, I probably shouldn’t have made myself so vulnerable without a weapon handy, but like I said I was just in fight or flight I can’t explain my actions in this moment other than reacting out of fear and determination to scare him out. 

Anyways, this dude didn’t even react to me whipping open the door and screaming at him. Not even a flinch. He simply turned his head to the side very slowly and said “my name is Evan.” This freaked me out so much for some reason, especially because he STILL hadn’t turned around or shown his face. I said I don’t care and kept cursing at him to leave and he slowly rose up with his hands up and said “I know, I know. I’m hiding.” He wasnt saying it in a pleading way though. He said it with this almost childlike, playful tone that freaked me the absolute fuck out. I hated this. 

The fact that he kept trying to reason with me and act so mysterious while still not even turning around to show his face just pissed me off honestly. Who do you think you are bro? I ran him out of the porch and was just threatening him. Now I assume it was just a homeless man who was under the influence of something, as I do live in an inner city area and it’s common to see homeless people near my street, but idk man. the sight of seeing him in my porch and knowing he was in there for at least an hour beforehand while I was sitting right there just freaked me the fuck out. I was in full blown defense mode by the time I opened that door and I wasn’t willing to waste any time to do a character dive on the guy. No imaginable situation would permit anyone to be in my porch like that at that hour. 

Needless to say, I’ll be double checking my porch lock every night from now on lol. It’s funny because having my room connected to the porch, I always had this horrific intrusive thought that I’d hear someone in there one night. Looks like it came true! 

So, please, Evan, let’s not ever meet again you creepy bastard!! ",120,0.97,6,cormegaflow,2024-11-30 00:48:41,1h36tg5
SelfImprovement,Improving your life is not that hard,"Yes, it really isn't. This post will take you probably 5 minutes tops to read. Let's not waste time:

1. Appearance: put in a little bit more effort with skin-care, diet and training routine. Find a ""signature"" clothing item you'll rock most of the time (mine is a turtleneck). Decide which 2 colors are your favorites, and see if they fit together. Done.

2. Career: three variants - there's jobs you are good at, jobs you find joy in, and jobs that pay well. Pursue something that has 2/3, 3/3 is ideal but rare. Work your butt off and strive to be the best at what you do. Plumber or scientist, you can excel. Done.

3. Hobbies: find like 4-5 sort of/very productive things you enjoy that you spend an hour or two on daily. Arts, playing board or video games, cooking, gardening, whatever it is. Rotate them during the week so you don't get burned out. Done.

4. Social: treat your daily life as if it was a video game - strangers are NPC's. They can give you quests, they can be your future lovers, they can be reformed mob bosses, whatever. Go out there and talk to folks - bar, street, bus, whatever. Find 3-5 quality friends and do fun stuff with them, mixed with productivity. Done.

5. Goals: have a monthly, yearly, and long-term goal planners. Have 3-5 smaller goals a month, 3-5 bigger goals a year, and 3-5 major goals over a several year period. If you mess up, dust yourself off and embrace failure, don't let it define you. Little by little, you'll grow. Done.

Done. Now go do it.",632,0.75,191,One-Party2973,2024-12-02 15:00:06,1h55mr1
SelfImprovement,I got called out by someone I dated about myself,"She is 26, I am 26. At first I was angry, but now, I get it. Nobody has really called me out before to this extent and I’m thankful for this person doing so. We were talking for only a month and she figured me out and told me we weren’t compatible because of certain reasons. I ended up getting blocked by her and that put me in a depressive mood for a couple of days.

Anyway, she told me that I am a negative person, she told me I don’t respect boundaries, that I am emotionally manipulative and that I don’t take accountability. Like these are so many toxic traits I don’t know where or how to even start, but I do know that I want to start. No wonder why nobody likes me platonically and romantically. I’m pretty sure most of these things derived from my mother’s behavior towards me. 

I’m aware that negativity can be detonated with positive affirmations everyday. Are there any other ways? Can anyone give me some advice on any of these toxic traits or all if you are willing to then it would be appreciated. ",171,0.92,71,greaselab,2024-12-02 04:53:10,1h4scme

DecidingToBeBetter,Revamped Flair System: Guide on Using the New Post Flairs,"Hello everyone! 

After months of observing how the flair system was being used, I noticed that many people were confused about which flair to use, and this often led to posts being flaired incorrectly. To make things easier for everyone and reduce confusion, I have revamped the flair system.

I have added new flairs and removed older ones to keep the posts more organized on the subreddit. These changes are designed to make it easier for everyone to find relevant posts and contribute in a more structured manner. 

Whether you are a long term member or new to this subreddit, please take a moment to check out this guide and familiarize yourself with the updated flairs! 

# 1- [Seeking Advice]

**Use this flair when you are looking for advice, guidance, or support** **in an area you are trying to get better at.**

If you're dealing with a specific challenge and need input, this is the flair to use.

**Examples**:

* “How do I overcome procrastination?”
* “I’m struggling to control my emotions, any advice?”

# 2- [Sharing Helpful Tips]

**Use this flair to offer tips, strategies, or advice that has worked for you.**

If you have found something that helped you on your journey to be better and think it could benefit others, use this flair.

**Examples**:

* “Things I did that improved my mental health.”
* “Tips on setting boundaries with family and friends.”

# 3- [Discussion]

**Use this flair for open-ended discussions or seeking general feedback from the community on a particular topic.**

If your post encourages others to share their thoughts, engage in conversation, or debate different perspectives, this is the flair to use. Asking for book/podcast/tools recommendations also falls under this flair.

**Examples:**

* “How do you stay motivated during difficult times?”
* “Does anyone else feel overwhelmed by the pressure to constantly improve themselves?”
* “What are some books or podcasts that helped you on your self-improvement journey?”

# 4- [Progress Update]

**Use this flair when you want to share a specific update or milestone about a goal you are currently working on.**

Whether it's a small win or recent improvement, this flair highlights the progress you have made on your self-improvement journey.

**Examples:**

* “I worked out 3 times this week and I’m proud of myself!”
* “I managed to cut down my screen time from 8 hours a day to 5 hours a day.”

# 5- [Journey]

**Use this flair to share a broader reflection on your self-improvement journey as a whole.**

This is less about a specific goal or milestone and more about your long-term experiences, insights, challenges, and growth over time.

**Examples:**

* “Over the past year, I’ve been meditating every day. Here’s how it’s changed my life.”
* “How learning to say ‘no’ as a chronic people pleaser has changed my life.""

# 6- [Success Story]

**Use this flair when you have reached a significant milestone or successfully completed a goal.**

This is about celebrating your achievements with the community so we can celebrate with you.

**Examples:**

* “After 6 months of hard work, I finally managed to quit smoking.”
* “I’ve been working on overcoming my self-criticism and low self-esteem for years. Today, I looked in the mirror and didn’t berate myself. Instead, I told myself I was beautiful.”

# 7- [Spreading Positivity]

**Use this flair for motivational posts, words of encouragement, or anything that aims to uplift the community.**

This is the flair to use when you want to share positive energy with the community and let them know they are supported.

**Examples**:

* “Healing is not linear. Progress takes time, and you are doing a great job.”
* “Read this if you are having a bad day.”

**This marks the end of the guide. I will continue to update this post if there are any changes.**

If you have any feedback or ideas on how we can improve the flair system even further, please feel free to share them in the comments below. Your input is important and helps make the community better for everyone!",5,0.86,1,whereverthelightis,2024-11-16 16:42:38,1gsz1s8

DecidingToBeBetter,"Your Guard Is Up, and It’s Keeping You Lonely","Have you ever wanted to connect with someone but felt like your mind was working against you?

I know that feeling all too well.

For years, I struggled with hypervigilance in my relationships.

My desire to connect was so strong, but my over-alert mind kept sabotaging my efforts.

In the past, I approached relationships with my guard fully up.

I’d analyze every word someone said, searching for hidden motives or signs of rejection.

I thought if I could catch the slightest hint of trouble, I could protect myself from getting hurt.

But instead of keeping me safe, this habit kept me lonely.

Here’s the thing: I genuinely wanted to build connections.

I craved meaningful friendships and relationships.

But my hypervigilance made me come across as distant, overly cautious, or even distrustful.

I’d unintentionally push people away before they had a chance to get close.

Looking back, I realized that my hypervigilance wasn’t protecting me—it was isolating me.

It took time, but I learned how to let my guard down, step by step.

And now, I want to help you do the same.

Here are some steps to overcome hypervigilance in relationships.

**Recognize the Pattern**

* Hypervigilance often stems from past pain.
* It’s your brain trying to keep you safe. By acknowledging this, you can stop blaming yourself and start moving forward.

**Test Your Assumptions**

* When you feel suspicious of someone, ask yourself:
* “Do I have evidence to support this thought?”
* “Is this fear based on the present or my past?” Challenging your thoughts can help you respond more rationally.

**Start Small with Trust**

* Building trust doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing leap.
* Share a small part of yourself and see how the other person responds.
* Trust grows in layers.

**Focus on the Present Moment**

* Hypervigilance often pulls you into ""what if"" scenarios.
* Ground yourself by noticing what’s happening now.
* “What do I see, hear, or feel right now?”
* “How is this person actually showing up for me?”

**Prioritize Safe and Healthy Connections**

* Not everyone deserves your trust, and that’s okay. Seek out relationships with people who are patient, consistent, and understanding.

If you’re struggling with hypervigilance, remember this: your desire to connect is not the problem.

It’s the fear of being hurt that’s holding you back.

By addressing that fear, you can open yourself to the genuine, fulfilling relationships you deserve.",52,0.95,3,BrilliantNResilient,2024-12-02 09:31:57,1h4xli1

**Please Be Aware**: We expect everyone to read the rules and guidelines of this thread. Mods *will* remove questions which we deem to be too involved for the theme in place here. We *will* remove answers which don't include a source. These removals will be without notice. Please follow the rules.

Some questions people have just don't require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.

Here are the ground rules:

* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right.
* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.
* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.
* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don't realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.
* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.
* Academic secondary sources are preferred. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the 'Oxford Companion' series, or a reference work from an academic press).
* The *only* rule being relaxed here is with regard to depth, insofar as the anticipated questions are ones which do not require it. All other rules of the subreddit are in force.",9,1.0,58,AutoModerator,2024-11-27 11:00:33,1h192cj

That makes enough sense for the United States, but it doesn't explain why it would be banned in the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, South America etc. where often the drug had been well established and there American racial politics wasn't relevant.

So why did the whole world from China, to Norway to Namibia choose to ban Marijuana and why has it been so persistent when other drugs legality (like opiates) have varied in their enforcement significantly. ",617,0.93,28,DonQuigleone,2024-12-02 09:07:51,1h4x1kh

We will ***not*** have any transphobia or TERFs in this sub.

For example, telling someone who brings up in posts about women that they’re not talking about trans women, or that bringing up trans women is derailing, is basically the same thing as saying trans women aren’t included in being women. 

Also keep in mind micro aggression and casual bigotry. You may not intend to exclude trans peoples or to cause dysphoria, but it can and does happen.

Annihilation - great cosmic horror film

Rosemary's Baby - Don't watch this if you're pregnant

The Stepford Wives - if you're frustrated with you relationship this slow horror will probably say what you are thinking. Go for the 1975 version, the 2004 remake is just stupid and doesn't feel like it had women in the writers room

Hereditary - for the mother-wound girlies

Midsommar - frankly this could have been 40 minutes shorter but if you've ever had a really passive douchebag boyfriend it hits right

Parks & Rec - comfort show for feel-good nostalgia

30 Rock - def problematic, has a lot that hasn't aged well but we support women's rights and wormen's wrongs

The Unbreakable Kimmy Smidt - same as the above but the intro objectively slaps

CasualConversation,I think a major reason people are having trouble dating that we don't have spaces or events dedicated to putting a bunch of singles together anymore.,"I was just thinking about how in the past, there used to be community events like dances where, if someone was attending the event, they were basically signaling that they were open to being approached romantically (unless they were attending it with a partner). In the decades since that's gone away, we've basically been making do with places like bars or hobby clubs or workplaces, but that causes some tension and frustration because the person asking people out (usually a man) is basically guessing whether the person they're asking out is open to being approached romantically, or if they're just there to enjoy a drink/talk about their hobby/get paid. At this point, a lot of people have received the message that people don't want to be hit on when they're just trying to enjoy another activity, but there's just not a space where people can be sure others are open to being asked out.

So basically everyone's forced into dating apps, which is a bad experience for pretty much everyone (if you're not a photogenic woman, it's basically crickets, and if you are a photogenic woman it's overwhelming and sometimes scary).

I'm happily married, so I don't have a horse in this race, but I'm sympathetic to the frustration I'm seeing from a lot of people and trying to think of ways to get people together.",231,0.95,90,Timely-Tea3099,2024-12-02 14:46:58,1h55b3z

A chat GPT generated definition of an internal dialogue:

Internal dialogue refers to the conversations or thoughts a person has within their own mind. It often involves reflecting, questioning, planning, analyzing, or imagining scenarios. This dialogue can take on various forms, such as:

Self-talk: Motivational or critical statements like “I can do this” or “Why did I mess up?”

Problem-solving: Thinking through solutions to challenges.

Reflection: Evaluating past experiences or planning for the future.

Internal dialogue is often verbal in nature, where your thoughts are expressed in words, almost like a conversation with yourself",13,0.85,20,Juuless_Joe_Jackson,2024-12-02 20:31:47,1h5d17r

Officers arrived to find a bloodbath. A teenage girl was unresponsive and halfway under the bed. She suffered multiple injuries: Her fingers had been broken, her ankle snapped and folded up under calf, and she had ten puncture wounds approximately 0.5in in diameter across her abdomen. According to one deputy, a large bee crawled out of one of these punctures and took flight.



As first responders stabilized the girl, one EMT caught a glimpse of eyes glinting under the bed.



Upon investigation, the EMT saw nothing except massive claw marks scoring the floor, as well as several deep punctures piercing the floor — punctures that matched the devastating injuries on the girl’s abdomen.



Two months later, a second child called EMS to report that her imaginary friend was “poking out my brother’s eyes.” Upon arrival, responders found a teenager boy with a freshly missing eye, broken fingers, and several large, deep puncture wounds throughout the body. 



Three weeks after that, a young adult called for an ambulance, claiming that his sister’s “insane friend” was trying to kill him. When responders arrived, no victim was onsite. A very hysterical minor in the home claimed that “he pulled my brother under the bed!” The whereabouts of the youth in question remain unknown.



Overall, eight such calls calls would be placed between February 2001 and January 2002.



During the last of these calls, a police officer discharged his weapon at what he claimed was the perpetrator: 



A small, deformed youth with massive claws, bulging eyes, and a mouth that fell so wide he could see straight down into its gullet. 



The suspect was never located, but he left behind a pool of blood on the spot where the officer claimed he fell once shot. 



When tested, the blood’s results were of unknown origin. Not human, not animal, not anything recognizable. The results maintained no matter how many times the sample was tested.



This is how this inmate came to Agency attention, and what eventually led to his capture.



It is important to note that this entity has been utterly uncooperative since capture. Every piece of information that the Agency has learned was done so without the inmate’s cooperation.



Research suggests that this entity has been active for approximately 60 years. Its modus operandi includes targeting a maladjusted child and gaining access to other children via the friendship. The entity is invisible to everyone except its original target until the moment of attack. During the attack, he attempts to drag his target under the closest bed. 



The entity takes the form of a young boy of approximately 8-10 years of age. He has large eyes, an angular face, and exceptionally large hands with long, finger-like appendages that appear somewhat similar to claws. Note that these appendages are powerful and capable of punching through most organic matter with ease.



The inmate wears a loose-fitting white blouse with large buttons, as well as a close-fitting hat with a round brim. His mode of dress is what prompted personnel to assign him the name “Pierrot.”



Research suggest this entity takes another form, but to date no Agency personnel have observed any form but the one described above.



It is important to note that this subject induced severe hysteria in T-Class Agent Rachele B. Her hysteria was temporarily brought under control by the supportive presence of T-Class Agent Christophe W., but by the end of the interview her distress returned and rendered her incapable of proceeding.



Due to the information obtained over the course of this interview, she is scheduled for an urgent debrief with Dr. Wingaryde and Commander Rafael W. once she is sufficiently recovered from her episode.

I liked bees because they scared the people who scared me.



The people who scared me were the people pretending to be my parents. I lived with them. I don’t remember why. I don’t even remember my real parents. I just remember living with the people who were pretending.



My pretend-father was afraid of bees. He was allergic to their venom. He always poisoned the bees and all the other bugs, too. My pretend-mother was happy about that because she hated all bugs, not just bees.



I was afraid of bees, too. The people who scared me were scared of them, so I believed that they were very, very scary. But I also liked them. I wanted to be scary like the bees. I wanted to scare the people who scared me.



But nothing about me was scary.



I was very small and very skinny and I always cried when I got scared. I was scared all the time because of my pretend-parents.



I didn’t have a name. Well, that isn’t true. I had a name, but they never used it so I forgot. My pretend-brother had a name. He had his own bedroom and toys and blankets. I don’t remember his name anymore. It’s been so long since I used it that I forgot.



My pretend parents had lots of rules. I wasn’t allowed to eat unless they fed me, and I wasn’t allowed to cry if they forgot. If I cried, then I wouldn’t get fed for three days. They always made me eat off the floor. Sometimes I was so hungry I licked the floor after.



I wasn’t allowed to leave the house. If I left the house, they would never let me back in and I would starve to death outside in the cold while they stayed in the warm house with food to eat. That’s what they told me, and I believed them.



I wasn’t allowed to have a bed or even a blanket. That made me sad. My pretend-brother had so many blankets, but I wasn’t even allowed to have one. Not even the ones he threw away.



I wasn’t allowed to talk to strangers or even look at them. If I broke that rule, my pretend-parents said they would break my fingers and pull my teeth out. 



But the most important rule, the number one rule, was I always had to do what I was told.



I never broke that rule.



My pretend-parents called me their little puppet because I always did what I was told, even if it was bad. Even if it hurt. And sometimes, doing what I was told hurt. Sometimes they hurt me even if I did what I was told. But they *always* hurt me when I didn’t do what I was told. 



That’s why I always did what I was told, even when it hurt. Even when it made me bleed.



I also hoped that doing what I was told would make me a good boy. My pretend-parents said my pretend-brother got his own room with a bed because he was a good boy. I tried to be a good boy too. I thought that’s how I would get my own room, by doing what I was told. I thought that’s how my pretend-parents would become my real parents.



But no matter how many times I did what I was told, no matter how many times I was the best puppet, I didn’t get my own room.



When I wasn’t doing what I was told, I was locked up in the top of the house. It was very hot there, and very dusty. I sweated so much that the dust and sweat made mud on my skin. It was grey, so sometimes I pretended I was a grey mouse eating cheese in the attic. I had never eaten cheese, only seen it. I used to dream about cheese. Sometimes I woke up crying when I had those dreams.



There were mice in the attic with me. Most of them were scared of me, but one crawled into my hand. Just like you, Wendy. You crawled right into my hand and held it. Why did you run away?



When my pretend-parents found out I was friends with the mouse, they put poison up in the attic and put me down in the basement where it was dark and cold. Every time a mouse died from the poison, they brought it down to make me look at it. I always cried no matter which mouse it was, but I cried hardest when they made me look at the mouse that crawled into my hand. I cried so hard that I wasn’t even making noise, just wheezes. They left her in the basement with me so I had to look at her until she turned into a skeleton. 



One time, after my mouse turned into a skeleton, my pretend-parents made me bleed even though I did what I was told. Then they put me back in the basement.



I wanted to be far away from the basement door, so I crawled over by the wall. My handprints left smears. That gave me an idea. I put my finger in the blood, and then I put it on the wall. It left a mark.



So I started to draw.



Drawing on the wall is bad. Drawing with blood is hard. But I drew on the wall with blood because it made me forget I was bleeding, and it made me forget about my mouse.



The blood dried up pretty soon, so I had to stop drawing.



But that didn’t mean I was done drawing for good.



I stopped being so sad whenever my pretend-parents made me bleed because it meant I would be able to draw later. The more I bled, the more drawing I could do. Sometimes I wanted to draw so much that I *didn’t* do what I was told, just so they would make me bleed more.



I drew a very big picture all over the wall. It was a drawing of a magic city full of giant bees. I drew their stingers really big, as big as swords so they could stab my enemies. Even though I was afraid of bees, I pretended I lived in the bee city because it was a place my pretend-parents would never come to.



But then my pretend-parents saw the drawing, and they made me hurt. They made me hurt when I did what I was told, so I stopped doing what I was told. They hurt me so bad I started doing what I was told again. They kept hurting me anyway.



When they were done I was so angry and so scared that I smeared all my blood all over the drawing to erase it. I didn’t need a city. I needed a door. A way out.



So in the corner of the wall, in the only place where I didn’t draw the city, I drew a door. A little one, a door that was almost too small even for me so my pretend-parents wouldn’t be able to fit through it. 



Then I drew a blood-bed with blood blankets on the floor by the door, and went to sleep.



A creaking sound made me wake up. I thought it was my pretend-parents coming to make me do what I was told, so I opened my eyes.



I saw that the blood door had turned into a real door.



And it was open.



I couldn’t see the room inside it, but I saw light. Golden lights and colorful lights, like afternoons in summer and the Christmas tree I wasn’t allowed to touch at the same time. It was so beautiful.



Then something huge came crawling by, blocking the light.



For a second I thought it was a bug, but it was way too big. Much bigger than a bug, or me, or my pretend-father even.



Then it stopped and looked at me.



I screamed, and then got panicked. I didn’t know what I was more afraid of — the big thing crawling behind the blood door, or my pretend-parents hearing my scream and coming to tell me what to do.



Then the big thing crawled forward, squeezing himself into the doorway until his face was close to mine. It was a weird face. Big and square, with black paint on his lips and white skin and eyes as blue as the sky.



He propped his chin on his hand and said, “What are you doing, little boy? Opening my front door without even knocking? Tsk, tsk.”



I was so scared I cried.



The big man pouched out his lip and crossed his ankles. I saw the shadow it made, like a stretched-out X, on my blood blanket. “Oh, don’t cry, little boy. Please don’t cry! I was only joking!”



But I couldn’t help it. I was so afraid, and he was so scary. Besides, I didn’t know what he meant. I didn’t know what joking was. I had never heard that word. “What’s joking?”



The man’s mouth fell open. His painted black lips scared me, but they looked funny too. Like he was a clown or a doll.



Or a puppet.



Just like me. 



“You poor child. You poor, poor boy.” He reached out with a hand bigger than my head and patted my arm. I flinched. I knew *that* word, because my pretend-parents often punished me for flinching.



But the scary man didn’t punish me for flinching. He didn’t even yell at me.



He only cried.



His eyes filled with tears. They shone in his eyes like melted silver. They didn’t look real. But I didn’t know that, because even though I cried a lot, I never saw anyone else cry so I didn’t know what tears looked like.



“What’s wrong?” I asked



He wiped his eyes. The silvery tears hung onto his fingers and slid down slowly, like they were dancing. They looked pretend, but when he flicked them off and they landed on me, they felt real. Just like my own tears when they fell on my skin. 



“I’m sorry for crying. It’s just that a little boy who doesn’t know what a joke is is *very* sad business.” His voice sounded thick and sad but so funny. So funny it made me laugh even though I was afraid.



Then the scary man reached down and pulled up the edge of my blanket off my bed, and he blew his nose.



*That* wasn’t funny at all. 



At first I thought it wasn’t funny because it was gross and it was *my* blanket. Snot is gross. I know about snot.



But then I remembered it wasn’t funny because the blanket wasn’t real. It was just a blood blanket on a blood bed that I drew on the hard floor.



Only it wasn’t a blood blanket anymore. It was real. The bed too. Real just like the blood door.



Before I could stop myself, I wondered if my bee city was real, too.  But I was too scared to ask that. Instead I just asked again, “What’s joking?”



He blew his nose again. “A joke is something funny. Something that makes you laugh.”



“I get in trouble if I laugh.”



He crooked his hand and put his chin in it again. He was so big and he didn’t really look like people. He looked like something pretending to be people. It was very scary.



But my pretend-parents were scary, and they were people who were not pretending to be people. They really were just people.



So I thought maybe something pretending to be people would be safer.



“In my City Bright,” said the big man, “we tell jokes every day. More jokes than anyone could tell in a lifetime.”



“Are there bees there? In your city?”



He held his hands out. “Many bees. Bees everywhere you look. As many bees as there are jokes. And nobody, nowhere in the entire city, who will ever stop you from laughing. Least of all me.” He pulled a funny face. Even though it was funny, it gave me goosebumps. But I laughed. “See? I can make you laugh. It will be my life’s work to make sure you laugh every day!”



He scooted backward, shuffling out to clear the doorway. “Come in,” he said. “Come into my city and I will teach you about jokes.”



But I was afraid. I was so afraid I started to cry, because I thought my pretend-parents would find out about this and come down to tell me what to do.



Then I thought that maybe the big scary man was a trick. That my pretend-parents were using him to trick me into talking to strangers. That I’d crawl through the door and they would be waiting for me and make me bleed everywhere for talking to strangers and trying to leave.



I started to cry again because I was so scared.



He started to cry again too, which scared me even more.



I was just *sure* that my pretend-parents were waiting for me. I was too afraid to move. All I could do was sit there and cry and wait for them to come out and tell me what to do.



The big scary man crawled away so I couldn’t see him anymore. I thought he was getting my pretend-parents. Telling them how bad I was. How I talked to strangers. How I tried to leave.



I was so scared that even though I was crying, I wasn’t making any sounds. It was hard to breathe. I was wheezing, like when they showed me my mouse who crawled into my hands. Have you ever been too scared to scream? I have, lots of times. But that was the time I was more scared than ever. 



Suddenly the scary man crawled back, wriggling like a worm on his elbows because his hands were folded. They were folded in a circle, like this. I used to fold my hands this way when I was holding my mouse.



The scary man gave me a smile, then opened his hands.



I flinched.



Bees flew out.



They were shiny like his tears, and big. Big like my thumb.



And when I saw them, I knew the scary man wasn’t my pretend-parents. My pretend-parents would never be friends with anyone who touches bees. 



So I wasn’t afraid anymore.



“I have other business to attend to,” the big scary man said. “But I don’t want to leave you alone, so take these bees and have a very good night, my son.”



He scrunched backward through the door and closed it.



I held the bees in my hand like the scary man did until I started falling asleep. I let them go and they crawled away. I saw their shiny silver bodies wriggle and burrow into the walls, just like the big scary man wriggled backward through the blood door.



I smiled and went to sleep.



When I woke up, the door was just a blood door again, and my bed was just a blood bed, but my blanket was still real.



My pretend-parents came downstairs to tell me what to do. When they saw the blanket, they thought I stole it from my pretend-brother and hurt me so bad I couldn’t even use my blood to draw anymore.



I stayed on the floor all day. It was so cold I shivered. Shivering hurt, but I couldn’t stop.



After it got dark, I saw lights in the wall. Golden skinny lights, like when light comes through cracks under doors. It was the blood door. It was real again. 



It opened. The scary man was behind it. He smiled and waved, but I just tried to crawl away. “Go away,” I said. “You got me in big trouble.



He didn’t go away. He reached out and grabbed my arm.



I flinched.



“Who did this to you?” the scary man asked.



I told him everything.



At the end, he clicked his tongue. The shiny bees came crawling out of the burrows in the wall and walked onto me. 



They stung me.



It didn’t hurt, though. Not at all. The stings just made me feel better.



They stung and stung until all the blood was gone and I didn’t hurt anymore at all.



Then the big scary man invited me through the blood door. He held out his hand.



I took it.



He pulled me through. It was like being on a water slide. I didn’t know what that was then, but I do now because there are waterslides behind the blood doors. I used to play on them all the time before you caught me.



Behind the blood door was the most beautiful and most horrible place I have ever seen. I loved it but I hated it. I wanted to go inside it but I wanted to run away and never see it again, even if that meant going back to my pretend-parents and doing what I was told.



It was just too much, and it made me cry.



The big scary man slapped his forehead. “Stupid, stupid! I took you to the *grownup* city. You need to go to the playground!”



“What’s a playground?”



That made the big man cry big silvery tears again.



When he was done crying, he took me to the playground.



It was wonderful and wondrous. That’s how he described it, and he was right. He’s always right. It never got dark. It never got cold. It was full of golden light and waterfalls and treehouses and playhouses and tunnels and burrows and secret hideaways.



Best of all, there were bees everywhere.



But I did not see any other children.



“Are there other kids?” I asked.



He slapped his head again and made a big surprised face with his blue eyes and black lips. “Of course! A boy needs friends! How could I forget? Sometimes you forget things when you’re old. I forget a lot of things, so I must be getting very old!” He shook his head and sighed. “That’s what we dads are, you know — old!”



“Are you a dad?”



“Of course! I’m *your* dad!”



That made me so happy that I laughed.



I laughed for a long time. That’s when I started to understand about jokes, when I was so happy I couldn’t stop laughing. That was such a good joke.



The big scary man was a good dad. He showed me around the playground and then he took me to a school because that’s where friends are.



Only I never saw a school before. I had never met any kids except my pretend-brother, so I didn’t know what to do. There were so many of them and it was so loud. I got scared and sat down in the middle of the sidewalk and had to try very hard not to cry.



When he saw how scared I was, my new dad apologized. No one ever apologized to me before. It made me so happy I cried, then hugged him and told him it was okay and he didn’t need to apologize. He said, “Of course I have to! Apologies are the right thing to do when you’re wrong., always” 



He was right. My new dad is always right. 



Then he took me away from the school and we went somewhere I did recognize: A bedroom. A nice one like my pretend-brother had.



There was a little girl in the bed.



We woke her up and took her under the bed to the playground. 



She was scared when she saw my new dad. She was scared when she saw me. She was scared when we brought her to the playground in Bee City. She was scared when I told her to stop being scared.



But she wasn’t scared after the bees stung her.



We played for a long time. I don’t know how many days, because the sun never goes down there.



But when I was finally done playing, my friend looked sick. You could see all her bones and her eyes looked like stars and her mouth was so, so big and it wouldn’t stay shut. There were holes in her, too. So many holes from all the bee stings.



Since my friend couldn’t play anymore, I gave her to the bees. They crawled into all the holes from all the stings and buzzed. The humming sounded like singing. Quiet singing. I didn’t know the word yet, but it sounded like a lullaby. I know that word now, and that’s definitely what it sounded like:



A lullaby.



The bees made honey, too. Golden shiny honey, just like the light. It dripped out and made the grass sticky.



When the bees got done making honey, my friend crawled into secret tunnel under the playhouse and started to sing. The way she sang made me laugh. A joke. My dad told me there were lots of jokes in Bee City, and he was right. He’s always right.



My new dad helped me find lots of friends after that. 



It was fun.



I always laughed when they were scared, and I laughed when the bees stung them to make them stopped being scared. I laughed at the funny ways they played. It was so many jokes, just like my new dad said, and my new dad is always right. 



But slowly, it stopped being funny and I stopped laughing at the jokes.



I didn’t like how my friends were all scared at first. It reminded me of how I got scared whenever I got told what to do by my pretend-parents. It made me think that maybe, I wasn’t making friends.



Maybe I was just telling them what to do.



I don’t want to tell anybody what to do. I just want friends. Real friends. You were my real friend, Wendy. So why did you run away?



When the bees started making honey inside my fifth friend, I told my new dad I didn’t want to do this to my friends anymore.



“Who will you play with, if not friends?”



I thought I was going to say *nobody*, but I was wrong.



Instead of saying *nobody*, I smiled a little. “My brother.”



My new dad gave me a very weird look. He leaned in with one eye big — I don’t know how else to say it, he just leaned down and got close until his big eye was almost touching mine.



Then he smiled big. Big as a wolf.



“Let’s get the boy his brother!”



He took me to my pretend-brother’s bedroom. I always wanted his bedroom, remember? I was so jealous that he was a good boy and that I was a bad boy even though I always did what I was told. I did what I was told because I thought that’s how you get your own room. I thought that’s how pretend-parents turn into real parents.



It isn’t.



That’s what my new dad told me, and he was right. My new dad is always right. 



My pretend-brother was very scared when he saw us and even more scared when he took him under the bed to get to the playground, but just like all the others he stopped being scared when the bees stung him. I laughed when he stopped being scared. It was funny. It was a good joke, just like my new dad said. He was right. He’s always right.



I played with my pretend-brother for a long, long, long time.



Finally he fell down, and I gave him to the bees.



I made sure he was full of bees. Fuller than any of my other friends. I turned him into a beehive. I turned him into a honeycomb. My new dad said he was colonized. 



I let him sing afterward, but I didn’t let him crawl into the playhouse under the tunnel because I had a different idea.



But I wasn’t sure it was a good idea, so I asked my new dad for advice. 



When I told him, he hugged me and said it was the best idea he’s ever heard. And my new dad is always right.



Then my new dad drew me a blood door right back into my old basement.



I put my pretend-brother on the basement floor. Honey leaked from all the honeycomb holes and from his eyes. 



Then I hid in the corner and waited for my pretend-parents to come downstairs to tell me what to do. 



When my pretend-father came downstairs and saw my pretend-brother, he screamed and screamed and screamed.



And that was *before* he saw the bees.



They weren’t big bees, but they all had big, long stingers, just like my blood drawings.



When the bees were done with him, he didn’t look like my pretend-father.



He didn’t even look *pretend* anymore. He looked like something else. Something too scary to be a monster but also too silly to be scary. Lumpy and so many different bruise colors. His lip swelled so big it was almost as big as my hand, and one of his eyelids looked like a big lumpy ball. All of him was like that. All of him was so swollen and so lumpy. So scary.



But so silly, too.



When he stopped moving, the bees crawled back into my pretend-brother and kept making more honey. They made so much it dripped out of the holes and made a big puddle that spread all the way across the floor and touched my feet.



I dipped my finger in it and ate it until my pretend-mother came. 



Her screams were even worse. They made me laugh so much. I think her screams were the best joke I ever heard. 



Wendy, I told you about that joke, remember? After you told me I didn’t live in Bee City, I lived in Neverland. I told you about all the jokes. You didn’t laugh, though. Is that why you ran away, Wendy? Because no one told you what jokes are?



Wendy, why did you run away?



You won’t run away again. My new dad promised.



And my new dad is always right.



\* \* \*



This is all kinds of fucked up and I don’t know where to start. It almost makes me wish I could interview myself just to get my thoughts straight, but I can’t.



I grew up in and out of foster care. My third foster home was bad. Not the worst, but still bad. The kind where the kids aren’t allowed any autonomy at all. You couldn’t eat, sleep, bathe, get dressed, or even pee except at scheduled times. I had never felt so out of control in my life. 



To cope, I brought back the imaginary friend I’d had when I super, super small. Not because I really believed in him — I was seven years old by that point, and had known what was real and what wasn’t for much longer — but because it was literally the only way to have something that my foster family could not control.  



As a kid, my favorite movie was Peter Pan. I definitely see the appeal that the whole “escaping into a magical realm run by kids where the only villains are grown ups” held for a kid in my situation, but I didn’t think too deeply about it. I only bring it up because I named my imaginary friend after him. When I brought him back in that foster home, I kept the name.



Anyway.



At first Peter was just a carbon copy of the cartoon. He was invisible to everyone but me. No one could hear him except me. I never had to talk out loud to him, because he could read my thoughts. This made it so we could play games all day every day, and no one could stop me.



It was innocent at first, but it got really weird really fast.



Almost immediately he insisted he came from a place called Bee City. I found that supremely irritating because he was Peter Pan, and everyone knows Peter Pan comes from Never Never Land. I told him so. I also lied about my name, and told him my name was Wendy and that anybody calling me different was lying.



He stopped looking like cartoon Peter too. He was still a little boy in a hat, but he was a real-looking little boy with like…a round hat and big wings. Not feathery wings, but wings like a bug. He had sad eyes, so sad that after a while I didn’t like looking at him even though he was pretend.





After all this happened, I didn’t think about it that much. I assumed that his steadily darker character was simply a reflection of how I was feeling at the time. I felt out of control, so he got more out of control. I was scared, so he got scary. Common sense, right? Literally a projection of what was going on inside me.



One day, Peter hurt one of my foster siblings for calling me by my real name instead of Wendy. I stopped him. But because he was invisible, everyone thought it was me and I got in massive trouble. While they figured out what to do with me, they put me out in the yard and forced me to hang wet bedding out to dry in the cold. That’s a form of torture. Especially for a second-grader who can’t even reach the clothesline without jumping. Don’t believe me? Give it a shot, then come back to talk to me.



While I was hanging laundry, Peter came back. I told him I didn’t want to see him, so he said, “Let’s do jokes instead” and started hiding behind the sheets. It was so fucking creepy.



So creepy I basically forgot he wasn’t real.



I was mad at him for not leaving, so I started chasing him. Pulling the sheets off the lines so he wouldn’t have anywhere to hide. But he was always faster than me, flitting back and forth. Every time I saw his shadow, I tore a sheet down only to see that shadow behind another sheet. 



That’s when I remembered something about Peter Pan. About how his shadow isn’t always attached to him. How it can peel away and do its own thing.



And somehow I knew he was behind me. Had been this whole entire time. I just knew.



I dropped the freezing sheet in my hands and turned around.



Peter stood there, half-hidden by the last billowing sheet, smiling. But he didn’t look like Peter. He looked like a monster. Worse than a monster. An insectile, corrupted, not even human, with a wraparound smile dripping honey.



I screamed and ran, tripping over the sheet. It tangled around my ankles and I fell face first in the cold mud, but I got up and kept running.



That was the worst trouble I’ve ever gotten in.



Ever.



Hurting a fake sibling? Bad.



Not doing chores? Worse.



Tearing all the clean bedding off the clotheslines and dropping them in the mud? Worst.



The trouble I got into was so bad — and the terror that came with being in trouble so acute — that it actually kind of drove Peter out of my head. I was hysterical, so scared I felt I was within an inch of my life from this monster hunting me in the backyard.



But he still wasn’t as scary as my foster parents. So scared that when I started flashing back during that interview, that’s what I was afraid of. Isn’t that insane?





Anyway, during and especially after the interview, I was a wreck. Like this dredged up memories I didn’t even realize I still had. I wanted out. I tried to get out. You know who tried to let me out?



Christophe.



You know who shoved me right back in?



Charlie.



You know who shoved Charlie out of the way and came in and sat with me until the interview was done?



Yeah, I was surprised too.



He actually kept me pretty calm. Calm enough until Peter — Pierrot — called me Wendy.



And then I just *lost* it.



I don’t even remember all that much, except for Christophe bellowing and Charlie placating and Commander Wingaryde — where did he even come from? — yelling about the Harlequin and how had no one ever made the connection?



At some point after that I just sort of came into awareness again, almost like I’d been under twilight anesthesia.



I was in a chair in the dining area, painfully aware of a dozen staff members looking on as I sobbed my heart out. Christophe was kneeling beside, holding and rubbing my hands the way my mom used to when I was sick. The way I knew his own mother had once held his hands after she’d scared him to death.



Unbidden, I remembered the cryptic warning I’d received just yesterday: *Christophe is the only one who gives a shit about any of the inmates, including you.*



I almost pulled away anyway, but I was so desperate for any comfort that I squeezed back.



When he noticed, he said, “What happened? You know that thing? That boy?”



I shrugged. “I…he was my imaginary friend when I was little.”



The searching look he gave me was so un-Christophelike that for a second I wondered if it was something pretending to be him. “Did you know he was here?”



“I didn’t even know he was *real*.”



That look again. “Why did he call you Wendy?”



For the first time since I walked into the interview room, my instinct kicked in. The one that tells me what to say and how to say it in order to get something beneficial to me.



And without even thinking, I threw one of Christophe’s myriad creeptastic retorts back in his face:



“We can talk later, but only if you’re brave enough to come to me all alone.”



He looked as if I’d slapped him.



Then the shock cracked apart and he started laughing. 



So did I.



By this point everyone — and by “everyone,” I mean about about a dozen other personnel trying to eat their lunch in peace — was watching us, so I got up to leave.



Christophe followed.



“I’m okay,” I said immediately.



“You’re lying. Even if I am wrong, the commander is going to come for you and he won’t care that you’re not okay. Do you want to talk to him now?”



“Um…no…?”



“Then I will keep him away until you feel better.”



“Why are you doing this?” I asked.



“Making sure all of you feel safe is part of my work. It is the only part I like.” He tapped his jaw. “The only part that doesn’t need teeth.”



He sounded so earnest that I didn’t even have the heart to tell him he is the only thing in the Pantheon that always makes me feel unsafe. 



He walked me to my room, patted me awkwardly on the shoulder, and headed back to the front of the hallway, ostensibly to head off Commander Wingaryde.



It’s been a few hours, and to his credit he’s kept everyone away.



I don’t even know why I’m procrastinating. It’s not like I’ll figure any of this out without talking to somebody who knows more, and I do want to know.



But I'm also afraid of what I'm going to find out.



And I still have no idea what to think about anything. Not about Peter — Pierrot — and what that means, or what the agency knows about me that I don’t, or what they're going to do to me, or what this means for our upcoming Harlequin hunt.



And I certainly no longer know what to think about Christophe. 



On one hand, the person who told me to be Christophe’s friend clearly knew what he was talking about.



On the other, I will literally never be able to forget what he’s done or what he is.



As terrible as it feels to admit, though, having a big bad wolf as a guard dog is probably not the worst development at this point.

nosleep,I live in a town that doesn't let you leave,"
Listen closely, because this isn’t a story. It’s a warning.

There’s a town not on any map, tucked away in a corner of the world so secret it barely exists. No one talks about it. Maybe they’ve learned to forget. But it’s real, and if you find it, you’ll never be able to leave.

I escaped once, but it’s only a matter of time before they find me again. I don’t have long, so listen carefully.

The town didn’t look unusual at first. If anything, it was painfully ordinary. Rows of houses with neat lawns. Crooked lamp posts that lined the empty streets. A town square with a statue of a man no one could name. At a glance, it could’ve been anywhere, the kind of place you pass through without a second thought. But the moment I stepped into it, I felt something was wrong, like static before a storm.

The town was governed by rules no one questioned. You could hear it in the footsteps that never strayed from the path and see it in the faces that never turned toward the clock tower. They were never written down, never spoken aloud, but everyone seemed to understand them. You didn’t question the rules. You didn’t step out of line. And you never tried to leave.

At first, I did what everyone else did. I followed the rules even though the only time I knew for sure what the rules were was when someone broke them. 

I lived quietly, kept my head down, and went about my day like nothing was wrong. But the town felt like a trap, like something was always watching me, waiting for me to make a mistake. Every time someone broke the rules, and it was always something small, something barely noticeable and mundane,  they disappeared. 

I remember the first time it happened. This older man, whose name I didn't know, even though I lived beside him for years, decided he wanted to take a different path. He didn’t follow the pattern of the street, the long lines on the roads and footpaths that quietly told everyone where to go. The following day, his body was hanging in the town square, twisted and broken, like some macabre display. No one acknowledged it. The townspeople walked around him like he wasn’t there, like it was normal.

I started to wonder who was watching. Who enforced the rules? There were no police, only strange men in white suits who patrolled the streets. It made you paranoid, made you question every step, every word. You couldn’t trust anyone, not even yourself. 

On the edge of the town, there was a dirt path that everyone ignored. It was there, plain as day, but no one spoke of it or dared follow it. They knew better. I should’ve known better.

I couldn’t help myself. The curiosity gnawed at me until I couldn’t ignore it anymore. One night, when the streets were dark, and the town was asleep, I decided to follow it. The path twisted and turned, snaking away from the town, but no matter how far I walked, I always found myself moving closer to the town. The further I went, the more I felt the town pulling me back, like a black hole dragging me toward its centre. The road kept bending in on itself, leading me in circles until I finally ended up right where I started. That’s when I knew there was no leaving. The town was alive, and it didn’t want me to go.

The next day, someone else vanished. A woman this time. She’d broken another rule, whispered something forbidden, something about leaving, and by morning, she was gone. But this time, there was no trace of a body, just her empty house, as if she’d never existed at all.

The town knew I was defying it. I could feel it watching me. The more I tried to understand it, the more desperate I was to escape.

One night, I saw it. Something that no one should’ve seen. The clocktower. Its face was always turned away, like it was hiding something, and the townspeople avoided looking at it. I’d followed that rule, too, at first. But in my growing madness, I dared to glance at it. That's when I saw the truth. The hands of the clock weren’t moving. They hadn’t moved in years. The town wasn’t bound by time. It existed in a liminal space, outside of everything, pulling in those unfortunate enough to stumble upon it.

When I first heard the footsteps, I knew I wasn’t just being watched; they were following me wherever I went. I never saw who made them, but they were always behind me, just out of sight. Every corner I turned, they were there, waiting. I knew my time was running out, so I decided to run.

I took the road again, and I didn’t stop this time. I ran until my lungs burned and my legs gave out. I kept going until the town was a blur behind me. And somehow, against all odds, I broke through. I found myself on the other side of the fog, on a highway, cars rushing past me like the world hadn’t even noticed I was gone.

That’s when I started writing this and telling my story. I thought I would be safe if I warned others and explained what was waiting out there,e. 

I tried hiding in the shadows of my newfound freedom. I had nowhere to go, but I thought they wouldn’t know where to find me if I had nowhere to call home. 

I’ve been seeing them again, the terrifying shadows that moved and twisted out of the corners of my eye. As the shadows moved closer, the footsteps got louder, and It was only a matter of time before they found me. 

I don’t know how long I was out. When I woke up, I was strapped to a bed, with fluorescent lights burning into my eyes. But I wasn’t in a town. I was in a hospital.

They told me I’d been there for years. They told me I wasn’t well, that I had imagined the town, the laws, the people. They said it was a delusion, a paranoid fantasy my mind had constructed to cope with something I didn’t want to remember.

But they’re wrong. The town was real. It is real. I know it. I felt it. 

They tried to explain it away. They said the people I saw weren’t townsfolk but other patients. The man who was hanging in the streets had managed to escape his room and hanged himself in the common room. The woman who vanished was old and got moved to a more comfortable place. They told me the clock tower was the hospital’s old, broken clock, stuck at the same time for years. The road I walked was just a hall leading to the hospital exit.

The doctors tried to calm me. They said it’s part of my recovery, that my mind is healing. But it’s not. They don’t understand. They can’t because the hospital is just another version of the town.

The rules are still there, hidden in the routines they force me to follow. The treatments, the schedules and the silence, It’s all the same. It’s just wearing a different face.

I can hear them again. The footsteps, slow and steady, coming down the street. They’re getting closer. I know what’s coming next.

nosleep,I work overnights in a dying convenience store. I had no idea this job would awaken me to the terrifying truth about what's happening to us all. ,"I can hear the hum of the fluorescent lights across the store now. I never used to be able to. Or maybe I always could, but subconsciously filtered out the sound.

Either way, I can’t afford to be unobservant anymore. I have to remain in the present moment, at all times. I used to love being lost in my own world, imagining stories and exciting scenarios. As I swept the floors, restocked the inventory, and even interacted with customers from behind the counter, there would always be some percentage of my brain off doing it’s own thing.

Those days are over. The ignorant illusion of safety I’ve been living in has now been irreparably torn away.  
  


I’m a 25 year-old man, finishing my last year at university, going for a degree in criminal justice. I’m pretty solidly built - not a bodybuilder by any means, but I do work out a few times per week and that probably makes me stronger than your average guy. So I was never really afraid working the overnight shift. I always figured I could handle myself against any late-night weirdos who wander in. And with what I’ve learned about the criminal mind through my studies, I thought I knew the signs to be on the lookout for.

But I was wrong.

I had assumed simple robbery, and maybe a few obstinate drunks, were the worst problems I would ever have to deal with. That was before I understood that evil takes many forms.

It all started about a month ago, one night around 11 pm. I remember the time because Sharrisa, my fellow store employee, had just clocked out for the night. She works the 3 pm to 11 pm shift, and my shift starts at 10 pm. So we see one another all the time, but only for an hour.

I knew she worried about going to her car alone at night, despite the jokes she would make about it. So each night I walk her out to her car, and try to lighten the mood. She isn’t comfortable in the dark employee parking area, at the far end of the lot, near a thick clump of trees. Each night, I temporarily close and lock the doors to the store while both of us are gone.

On that night, after saying goodbye, she hopped in the driver’s seat, and I turned and started back towards the store.

A few steps into my journey, my shoulders hunched against the biting January air, I glanced up. It was already standing in front of the double glass doors, a black silhouette against the yellow light from the store.

The dark shape stood tall, wearing a long black coat and a wide-brimmed hat. It almost looked like a mobster from an old gangster movie or something. It’s back was to me, as it stood just staring into the store.

As I drew closer, the dark shadow didn’t turn to the sound of my steps.

I could feel my heart beating faster as I approached, eventually standing right next to it to unlock the door. As I fumbled with my keys, the dark stranger finally turned to look at me.

A man’s pale face with a vacant, dead look in his eyes was just barely visible through the shadows. For just a second, it was as if I were standing next to a corpse, with no expression whatsoever or the faintest hint of life in its eyes. And then it smiled.

For the first time in my life, I watched the supernatural reveal itself right in front of me.

The smile stretched too far. It wasn’t just a big smile, it was an impossible smile. The closed mouth extended almost all the way to the earlobes on both sides of his head.

My eyes grew wide and my heart was pounding in my ears.

Almost instantly, as if it realized it had overstepped the bounds of normal human behavior, the smile vanished and the face returned to its previous, dead expression.

I didn’t know what to say, or what to do. I felt that commenting on the impossible smile would only encourage it to come back, and that was the last thing I wanted. There was only one thing I was sure of. I wasn’t standing next to a human. I stood next to an “it”, not a “he”.

I just reverted to doing what I was already going to do, because that’s all I could think of. Wordlessly, I walked past him, unlocked the doors, and went inside, heading quickly to the counter at the front of the store. As if the short wall and cash register would somehow protect me from whatever was happening.

When I reached the cash register and turned around, I saw the store remained empty. But the man, or thing, or whatever it was, still stood outside, still looking in through the glass doors. For the longest time it stood motionless, keeping its stare on me. I stared back, unable to move, caught completely off guard on what to do in this situation.

And then it turned and walked off, back into the parking lot. I watched as it walked across the spot where Sharrisa’s car was usually parked, and into the thick clump of trees nearby.

I continued to stand there, unable to understand what had happened, or how fear had somehow radiated from it. It wasn’t just because of its disturbing appearance and freakish expressions. I had felt the fear even before I had seen its face, or the unnerving, too-wide smile. And now, even after it was gone, I was afraid.

For the next several hours, I anxiously looked up whenever I saw someone approaching the doors. Each time, it was just another customer, bundled up in a heavy coat and ready to make a quick, wordless purchase before heading back into the night.  
  
I didn’t know what to do, or if I should tell anyone about what had happened. Would they just think I was crazy?

I glanced at the security camera pointed at the front door and shook my head. The store cameras are a joke. None of them still work. They leave them up for appearance’s sake, so people at least think they’re being recorded, but the store I work for is part of a dying brand. The money has long since dried up, as we’re outperformed by the newer, bigger stores. But somehow the remaining stores limp on, eking out profits too small to spare the expense of having our security cameras repaired.

 

Which left me with no way to prove what I had seen. 

 

It wasn’t until about 2 am that I saw it again. I was restocking the medicine on the shelf nearest the counter, glancing over towards the doors every couple of minutes. The next time I looked, it was standing there, in front of the glass doors, just staring at me.

I jumped backwards, tripping over the basket holding the new meds and falling on my butt, bottles of pain relievers clattering and rolling all across the floor. I scrambled back to my feet as I heard the door chime.

As soon as my head popped over the aisle, I saw the doors were still closed. That alone was odd, because if someone entered the store, the doors usually took a few seconds to close, and I should have seen at least some movement to show they were closing.

But they remained stone-still, with the figure outside now gone.

Was he inside the store now?

I stood motionless and strained my senses for any trace of movement.

For a few seconds, there was nothing.

Then I heard a soft slapping sound, like flesh on the tile floor. Like someone was crawling around on their hands and feet.

I ran behind the counter again, looking for anything I could use as a weapon. There was nothing. My best bet was to call the police, but how long would that take? The thing was here *now*.

The slapping sounds increased in speed and intensity, as I heard it crawling along the furthest parts of the store, almost as fast as a person could run standing up.

I grabbed a magazine and rolled it up in my hand, while a small, isolated part of my brain laughed at how utterly useless that was. It just felt better to have *something* in my hand, a small extension that I could keep between myself and this thing. It was a tiny comfort psychologically, even if it wasn’t going to help physically.

The fleshy, slapping sounds increased even further in speed, as whatever it was came to the very last aisle.

I braced myself for whatever was about to appear, but all the sound suddenly stopped.

He was still there. *It* was still there. Just behind the last aisle.

The store grew supernaturally quiet. I couldn’t even hear the ticking of the clock behind me.

Then, in slow motion, like a nightmare coming to life, the head came into view. It wasn’t low to the ground, like someone on all fours. It was near the top of the aisle, and rising ever higher.

It was wearing the same wide-brimmed hat as before, but the face was almost totally unrecognizable.

The eyes were wide open, staring. At first, I thought they were entirely white, until I spotted the black pin prick pupils in the center of each.

The smile was back, this time a full-blown grin with the lips pulled back and teeth exposed. They were entirely normal looking human teeth, but there far too many of them, stretching from ear to ear it a hideous parody of a smile.

I saw as it slowly came around the corner, that it was still rising from being on all fours, but its neck had stretched out to an infeasible length, putting its head near the ceiling. The limbs too, were growing, stretching out longer with each passing second.

And then it was as if my body took over, when my brain no longer knew what to do. My primal instinct to survive kicked in, and I was turning, sprinting, down the store. Not towards the front doors which were still too close to the thing, but to the walk-in refrigerator on the far-right side, where we keep all the cold drinks in storage.

The door itself was thick, heavy and solid, but the room it led into was far from secure. The entire wall on one side was made of easily opened glass doors, with only the trays of drinks between the inside and out.

But I didn’t know where else to go. It was between me and the exit. I could hear the thing scrambling around on the floor outside the walk-in, so I slammed the door and locked it from the inside.

 

Then I ran down the refrigerated aisle until I reached the small walk-in freezer in the very back.

I paused.

The freezer had a thick metal door every bit as solid as the walk-in fridge, and it had no glass walls, or even windows. It undoubtedly looked more secure and would hide me better.  
  
But I also knew that without my coat, I wouldn’t be able to stay in there for very long. It also didn’t lock from the inside, like the walk-in door could, so it really wasn’t any safer.

I stood by the freezer door, shaking hand on the lever, ready to open it and run inside at the first hint that something else would enter the walk-in.

I waited, trembling as much from fear as the cold, my vision occasionally slightly obscured from my breath turning into condensation in the air.

After what seemed like hours, I heard the front door chime again. 

*Was that the thing leaving? Or did someone new come in?*

A few moments later, I heard a male voice call out “Hello? Is anyone here?”

I relaxed just a little. If the thing was still out there, this new person would have seen it.

I walked over to the trays of soda and peered between them, through the glass door and out into the store.

It seemed empty, save for one short, bulky person wandering up to the counter.

With shaky legs, I walked towards the door, and unlatched it. I held onto it at first, for fear it would suddenly be pulled open by a great force, and the thing would be standing there.

But nothing happened, except for the man calling out for service one more time. “Hey, I need a pack of cigarettes! Is anyone here?”

I slowly pulled the walk-in door open, to see no unearthly terrors waiting on the other side.

The store seemed as normal as it ever had.

I slowly walked out, and turned towards the counter.

“Oh there you are!” the stout, Hispanic-looking man exclaimed. “Yeah, can I get…uh… you ok pal?”

I looked at the concern written across his face.

“Yeah.” My voice came out in almost a whisper, raspy and a little shaky.

“You’re as pale as a ghost!” he laughed nervously. “You sure you’re okay?”

I continued my trek to the front of the store, quietly passing him and entering behind the counter.

“Yeah,” I said again, a little more strength in my voice this time. “What brand did you want?”

He told me, and as I was handing them over, he said, “Must be working too many overnights, eh pal? Make sure you get a good night’s rest when you can!”

His smile faded quickly when I didn’t return it, and he quickly pocketed the pack and left the store.

As he left, I saw the glowing red numbers on the clock above the slowly closing exit doors read 4:08 AM. I was alone in the store again, or so I hoped.

An hour and a half later, Patrick the manager came in for his shift, and allowed me to clock out a bit early when I told him I didn’t feel well. He’s a nice guy, we’ve never had any problems, but there’s no way I could tell him what happened. I didn’t think there was a way to tell *anyone* what happened.

I walked out to my car, eyes darting everywhere, but I saw nothing out of the ordinary. Quickly, I unlocked my trusty old Honda’s driver-side door and slid behind the wheel, before whirling to check the backseat, just in case.

A few empty protein packets on the backseat floor were all that lay behind me.

I slowly turned and drew a deep breath, closing my eyes, forcing myself to be calmer.

I had felt helpless, almost hopeless, for most of the night, a part of me believing that I wouldn’t see the morning sun again.

Now that it was here, I felt my resolve and strength gently rise with it. I didn’t know what exactly had happened, but I was *determined* to never feel that way again.

 

Many people would have perhaps quit this job by this point. But I didn’t want to. And it wasn’t out of bravery. Or because I needed minimum wage money so desperately that I was willing to face an unspeakable horror. But it was because of that unspeakable horror that I knew I had to stay.

For the rest of my life, I knew, I would be looking over my shoulder, fearing the dark. I could run, but I would never really stop running, at least not in my mind. I wanted to face this thing head on. I was a criminal justice major, I had always wanted to defeat evil. I had to *win*, so I could be free. I did *not* want to ever feel the same way I had a few hours earlier, and it was up to me, and me alone, to take steps to ensure that.

I had never before felt my world shaken like this. I had felt a sense of confidence in almost everything thing I did. And I was ready to reclaim that feeling by defeating what made me afraid.

*First things first*, I thought. I would need to bring my Glock 19 into work for my next shift. The small but powerful handgun would be easy to conceal,

Patrick would *never* agree to an employee bringing a gun inside the store, but fortunately he usually isn’t even working when I come in, and it’s not like Sharrisa gives me pat downs each shift to make sure I don’t have weapons.

*Maybe I’ll never need it. I hope I won’t,* I thought. *But one thing I do know for sure, I won’t be running next time.*

If I saw the thing again, I’d hold it at gunpoint, while recording it with my phone. Once I had all the evidence I needed, I’d call the police and let them look at it. That was plan A. But if the thing rushed me… well, a disgusting, distorted dead monster is pretty good evidence as well.

*Hey, maybe I’ll even get famous from this. I could figure out a way to make money from it. I hope the thing DOES show up again tonight. This could turn out to be a good thing in the long run!* The thoughts comforted me, increasing my resolve to actually return for my shift that night.

I slept like a log as soon as I got home, the adrenaline that had pumped through me earlier had drained me thoroughly. Upon waking to the alarm on my phone that evening, I was pleased to find the confidence was still there. By the time I was driving back to the store for my next overnight shift, I felt ready. Powerful even. Nothing was going stop me.

But as I pulled up into the employee parking area, I felt that earlier sense of confidence and bravery drain right back out of me, as the setting of the sun seemed to take with it the same resolve and strength it had brought me that morning. My gut had turned into a cold, hollow void. I was feeling less like a warrior and very much like a scared little kid with a gun.

As I got out of the car, I tucked the gun into the back of my pants and made sure my shirt covered it. As I approached the double glass doors, both of them appearing pale orange in the dying light, I realized my heart was not only pounding because of what I feared I might have to face at night, but also that I would be caught bringing a gun into the store.

To my relief, Sharrisa was busy restocking in the walk-in when I entered, so I had a few minutes before she came back out. There were no customers in the store. I went behind the counter and pulled the gun out. I hid it against the wall of the counter, behind a big stack of old magazines.

The rest of the hour that Sharrisa and I worked together I was tense, as I feared by some freak accident, she would discover the gun hidden beneath the counter.

But as I walked her out to her car once again, I felt that uneasiness fade. It was replaced by a deeper, colder feeling, one that made my first fear seem almost childlike by comparison.

The worst-case scenario of Sharrisa finding a gun was that she’d report me to our boss, and I’d get fired. Big deal. The worst-case scenario of everything else that was about to happen, was something so terrible that I could not allow my mind to go there.

The night plunged on into deeper darkness as it seemed fewer-than-normal amounts of people came into the store. The tiny sense of safety I’d hoped to derive from being with other people was overridden by my new understanding of reality. These people were all living in the same delusion of relative safety that I had been living under. A part of me longed to return to the ignorant bliss that I had only 24 hours earlier, but another part of me knew that the illusion of safety did not protect me from this thing I couldn’t understand.

The small trickle of customers throughout the night slowly died out, and just after midnight, I was totally alone again. I listened to the now audible buzzing of the lights across the store, knowing I really needed to restock a few of the shelves, but somehow afraid to leave the counter I stood behind.

It hadn’t saved me before, but it just somehow felt safer to be there. And of course, the gun was closer.

I bent down and checked behind the stack of magazines for the hundredth time, ensuring that the gun was indeed still there. I kept half expecting it to have fallen to some other area, but each time I looked it was still in the exact same place.

As I straightened, a flicker of movement caught my eye from the store windows on the right-hand side.

I turned to see the same thing from the night before, walking along the outside of the store to the front doors.

It was in it’s fully human shape at first, but I watched as it passed between each window, the neck and limbs each growing slightly longer and more distorted with each window it passed.

Panicked, I reached under the counter and grabbed the gun.

As I looked up again, I saw it outside the double glass doors, now on all fours, distorted and oddly bent limbs twisting and turning in all directions. The head had the same pinpoint, wild-eyed stare, and the mouth was opening into the same grin, this time with the mouth opening more. I could see now that not only did it have far too many human-like teeth stretching from side to side, but also into the mouth, layers upon layers of molar-like teeth covered the fleshy tunnel.

It suddenly let out a shriek that sounded like a woman’s scream mixed with a pig’s squeal. It burst through the doors and charged straight up the center aisle towards me.

I raised the gun and fired, round after round, in the general direction of the creature.

I’m embarrassed to say it now, but I closed my eyes the entire time. Once I had the gun aimed I just couldn’t bear to look at the thing charging me for a millisecond longer, and I squeezed my eyes shut as I pulled the trigger over and over again.

I stopped when I heard the clicking of an empty chamber each time I pulled the trigger, and nothing else.

I opened my eyes.

The creature lay on the ground, having shifted back into its human-shaped form, but pouring out of its head, arms and legs was a thick black smoke. It spewed the thick, almost solid mixture up into the air, where it seemed to be pulled backwards through the glass doors and up into the night sky.

I stood, disbelieving as the last of the black smoke left the human shape and vanished.

The corpse of a man, or at least what looked like a man, lay on the floor, his body riddled with bullet holes, blood pooling on the floor.

*Uh-oh.*

This was not good. This was *really* not good. I had killed the thing that stalked me, but to absolutely anyone else it was going to look like I just murdered a customer, and I had no proof of the supernatural to show otherwise.

Yet another kind of fear entered by body, this one a panicky, guilty sort.

*What was I going to do? What could I do?*

And in that moment, I resolved to do what I knew was best. Others would not understand what I did, but of course, I understood. And I couldn’t let the obvious confusion that others would have had slow me down.

The trash truck always came at 5am, and they just used machines to lift the dumpsters into the truck. They never check them. And that was the only way to dispose of the body that I could think of.

I quickly wrapped the body in plastic trash bags, and dragged it out to the dumpster, all the while fearing an approaching customer would spot me.

But no one came as I dragged the body outside, or as I struggled to heave it over the side of one the two giant metal dumpsters behind the store.

I ran back inside as soon as I had heaved it over, fearing a customer might arrive at any moment and ask what I was doing.

But there was no one, and I was left alone to scrub the floor and battle with my fear-ridden, guilty thoughts.

*What will happen if the body is discovered and traced back to me? Will there be any sign during an autopsy that it isn’t really a man? Or maybe it is a man, possessed by some dark force that left after I killed him, leaving him as a very human corpse.*

 

I shook my head. Whatever the case may be, I was attacked, and completely justified in my actions. Whether I killed a monster in the shape of a man, or an evil force able to take control and manipulate the body of a man, the fact that I had to kill it was undeniable. There’s no telling who it could have killed after it was finished with me. I had probably just protected a lot more people along with myself.

Nevertheless, the haunting guilt and fear followed me for the rest of the night. It was nearly as much of a relief to see Patrick entering the store to relieve me when morning came as it had been the morning before.

I had already pocketed all the shell casings, and I only found one missed shot, which had buried itself in a large package of flour near the store entrance. I bought that flour package myself and already had it stored in my car.

I drove home, feeling the early morning light on me and a small sense of accomplishment within me started to grow. I had done it. I had faced my fear, and defeated it, saving who knows how many other lives in the process. As with the morning before, I felt completely drained, but the guilt and fear were fading away entirely, leaving me with a sense of achievement. As soon as I arrived home, I went to bed and slept deeply.

To my pleasant surprise, the feeling of accomplishment was still with me when I woke up, even though I realized I had been sleeping for an unexpected 10 hours. It was with me as I did the assignments on my last few classes, as I cleaned my apartment, and as I got ready for work.

I brought my gun with me again, less for protection this time, and more like a trophy. It was like my friend. It had brought me through a really dark, scary experience and now I was happy to keep it with me.

I walked through the double glass doors confidently this time, after I arrived at work. I talked and laughed with Sharrisa, stocked the shelves and swept the floors, and found myself feeling more like my old self. No, better than my old self. I felt almost on top of the world. I suppose that happens when you come through the other side of a life or death experience.

But it wouldn’t last.

Later that evening, after Sharrisa had left and I was the lone employee once again, what looked to be a dad and his two young daughters came inside. The girls, who looked to be around six or seven years old, browsed the candy aisle, while the dad went to the refrigerated section where we keep alcoholic drinks.

I smiled at the girls as they quietly whispered to each other about their favorite candy. They were both so quiet. They almost appeared to be a little scared.

I looked over at the dad.

He had stopped looking at the beer, and had turned his head to face me.

I watched as he slowly smiled at me, the line reaching from ear to ear. His eyes grew wide, the whites taking over as the pupils shrank into tiny pinpoint dots.

I stared, unable to believe that I was seeing this nightmare take place again.

I felt my stomach drop, and the old fear I thought I had left behind returned in full force.

And then without a word, the man, or thing, returned his facial features to a flat, expressionless normal look and turned once again to look at the beer.

I was stunned.

I glanced over at the fearful girls, who were glancing over towards his direction, and then back to each other. Like they were hiding from him.

The gun suddenly didn’t feel like a simple trophy, but once again a lifeline I would have to cling to.

As I reached beneath the counter, behind the magazines, I heard him approach.

My head shot back up to see him place a six pack of beers on the counter, his head down as he fished for his wallet.

The little girls came up alongside him, each placing a bag of candy next to his beer.

My heart was thudding in my chest. He looked back up at me with a strange expression, but not an inhuman one. He handed me his credit card.  
  
One hand found my gun and I clutched it tightly as I stood up straight, gun still hidden behind the counter but pointed straight at him. With my other hand, I slowly, gingerly reached for the card.

He didn’t move, but continued to stare, holding the card out to me.

I took it and put it in our credit card reader, looking at the name on the card.

I memorized it.

I ran the card through our ancient credit card reader and handed him the receipt. I’ve done this so many times I can do it with one hand, which was absolutely necessary because there was no way I was going to loosen my grip on the gun beneath the counter.

The girls took their bags of candy as he took his card back and scooped up the six pack. He looked at me again as his face contorted once again into a grizzly, open-mouthed smile. I could now see the entire inside of his mouth was totally lined with teeth.

My finger tightened on the trigger, shaking.

Just before I could squeeze, his face reverted back to normal and he turned and walked towards the doors, the girls in front of him.

The thought of shooting flashed through my mind, but I knew I might hit the girls. And before I could decide what to do, they left.

I walked from around the counter and stood by the window, watching as they piled in a rusted old jeep. When the lights came on, I could see the tag light illuminate the license plate.

I memorized the sequence of letters and numbers, then ran back behind the counter and wrote them down before I could forget, along with his name.

 

Now I had his name, and his license plate number.

He might come back, he might not. But at this point, I wasn’t concerned about myself. I was concerned about the two little girls with him. They were apparently in the custody of a monster in human flesh. I remember their frightened eyes. I knew there was no telling what he did to them, or planned to do in the near future. But I knew what I planned to do.

For the average person, a license plate number would not help them find a vehicle’s owner. But as a criminal justice major, I knew police often use an ALPR system to help them discover the owner of a vehicle, along with their home address. I had his name, and his license plate number, and I know certain backdoor websites that use pirated ALPR programs to essentially do the same thing.  
  
I spent the next several hours on the computer behind the counter tracking him down, or at least the bag of flesh that used to house his soul.

Finally, I found his address, only 15 minutes away.

And so, at 3am, with no one at the store, I locked the front doors and put the newly discovered address into my GPS.

To make a long story short, the inhuman creature masquerading as a man will not be harming those little girls anymore.

The slight fear that I had somehow killed an innocent person was relieved when the single bullet that punctured his bedroom window and his skull released a waterfall of thick, heavy black smoke. There was so much it filled the entire room and began spewing out of the tiny hole in the window.

I was back at the store well before 4am, my hands shaking, but that feeling of triumph returning.

The evil darkness that pretends to be human is still out there, I know. I see it almost every night now, in the eyes of various people who enter the store. It’s in the dark aura, the faint whisps of smoke I see exit the nostrils of some, the slightly too wide smiles of others who quickly hide them when they catch me staring.

My eyes have been opened to the grim truth of the world, opened to seeing the silent invasion of evil into normal-looking, everyday people.

I’m not sure who to trust anymore. Even some of the regular customers, who didn’t show any signs of containing evil before, are displaying clear signals now. I don’t know if they were previously clean and became infected, or if they were always inhuman creatures and I’ve only just gotten better at noticing.

So, I’ve done everything I can to make sure my senses stay sharp. I stopped eating junk food that only slows me down, stopped watching TV that dulls my senses. I’ve also stopped taking the so-called “medicine” that’s supposed to treat me for a disease I don’t have.

If your senses have been sharpened, if you’re more alert and awake than ever before because you stopped taking a pill, then you can bet that pill was made by one of them. I don’t have “paranoid schizophrenia”, I never did. What I have, what I’ve always had, is a gift, and ten years ago a doctor whose insides were filled with black smoke prescribed me a drug to keep me docile, dull and compliant. But no more.  

I’ve decided to write all this down, and release it, for two reasons.

Firstly, if you’re human, I want you to know there is someone out here fighting for you, fighting for all humanity. I want you to know the truth of the world, and what we should all be fighting against. I want you to know the signs to look out for.

The other reason is for you creatures, you demons wearing human flesh. If you’re reading this, I want you to know I am here. I can see you. I want you to be afraid. I intentionally left the details of where I live and the store I work in vague, so you can’t track me down. But I could be anywhere. I could be in your hometown, I could be that clerk behind the counter that just took your credit card. I want you to know, if you come into my convenience store, I will see you for what you really are. And once I have your information, there will be no escape.

This month we are celebrating u/ForwardSavings318

ForwardSavings has been writing on the subreddit for a little over half a year now, and it’s been great to see them developing as a writer within that time. From what I’ve seen of their writing, they definitely like exploring dark fantasy, but whether they’ll decide to lean into the darkness, or subvert it by putting a humorous spin on it is anyone’s guess. They’ve also really thrown themselves into the community here, giving feedback to other writers as well as learning from the feedback given to them.

Here’s what the person who nominated them had to say:

> Their writing has been constantly and greatly improving, particularly in the weekly features, as they seem to take crit very much on board. They have also joined in with discussions and campfires a lot in the server.

Want to congratulate this month's Spotlight recipient? Have questions you're dying to ask them? Please do so below in the comments!

# This Week’s Challenge

&nbsp;

Hi friends!! It’s December! 

I had a long think on what exactly to do for december, and in the end,  I decided to try and focus on some music genres like Cody did in the past. I probably won’t cover these quite as well as he did, but I am gonna try <3         

I am actually going to start with one that Cody already did, and we can simply call it an homage. If you know very much about me, you won’t find it very surprising that I would pick this genre of music to go with first, or ever, for that matter. 

Me and [Ska music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ska) have a long and sordid history that I won’t get into here, but tbh I reserve my right to get into it later on…                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

&nbsp;

###How to Contribute:

&nbsp;

Write a story or poem, **no more than 800 words** in the comments using **at least two** things from the three categories below.  The more you use, the more points you get.  Because yes!  There are points! You have until [11:59 PM EDT/EST  7 December 2024](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/party?iso=20241207T2359&p0=419&msg=Deadline+for+Seus&font=cursive&csz=1) to submit a response.

After you are done writing, please be sure to take some time to read through the stories before the next SEUS is posted, and tell me which stories you liked the best. You can give me just a number one, or a top 5, and I’ll enter them in with appropriate weighting. Feel free to DM me on Reddit or Discord (Alyxbee on Discord)!

As a note, I do find it super helpful when folks add the word count to the bottom of their story <3

TrueOffMyChest,Want to fulfill all your wildest dreams? Become a Reddit mod!,"Picture this: You're soul searching in between jobs, enjoying the single life to discover your inner self and allowing your mother to live above you and all you ask her for in exchange is a daily delivery of dino chicken nuggies and a refreshing bottle of mountain dew. It all sounds perfect, right? So why does it feel like something's missing? Well look no further because we have the solution for you...

**Reddit Moderation!**

What could more perfectly complement your fulfilling lifestyle than playing internet cop on Reddit? See a post you disagree with? You can delete it! User making valid points and hurting your feelings in modmail? Mute them! Having a bad day? Just ban a random, unsuspecting individual!

`**Disclaimer for Mod Code of Conduct purposes: you can't actually do any of this`

On to more serious matters,

We are in need of more moderators to help maintain the subreddit. No experience is needed. All we ask is that you have the time, patience and a good sense of humor. Our team will be available to train you and answer any questions you have. Communication is a *must* and really, why wouldn't you want to talk to us? You'll be placed on a probationary period to start and we fully understand that mistakes will be made and activity may fluctuate. Please note that being selected as a mod does not guarantee you will be a permanent addition. Not everyone is a good fit and that's okay.

So what does moderating actually entail?

* Clearing the queue will be your #1 task. The queue is where you'll see any content that has been reported or our automod has flagged for review. All you have to do is go through it, read the content and decide whether to remove it, approve it and sometimes report or ban a user. The queue fills up *fast* and needs a lot of attention. Seriously, some of you need to lay off the spam reports.
* Modmail is your next task. It's mostly users asking why their post is missing (automod ate it 99% of the time) and asking that you fix it. We also recieve ban appeals here. If you're lucky, you'll get a death threat every now and then. Hooray! If any modmails are uncomfortable, too personal or upsetting to you, you can delegate it to another mod.
* Sometimes a post will come up that's especially spicy or attracting a lot of attention. When this happens, one of our mods likes to comb through the comments for violations or sit on it to monitor incoming comments for violations. If it gets too much to handle, or someone isn't available, you can lock it.
* Communicating with the team is one of the most important tasks in your role as a moderator. As a team, we discuss moderation actions, rule changes, sub events and the direction of the subreddit. That all sounds very boring but rest assured, there's a lot more casual talk than anything else so feel free to chime in on Beaver's dislike of garlic bread (encouraged), Tim sharing new sanrio drops or my Call of Duty K/D ratio.
* Lastly, let's talk about the meta. Sometimes things need doing on the sub, like this recruitment post I was supposed to make months ago. While the day to day is important, we also need to keep the sub up to date with new features and tools and update it to fit the growing userbase.

If you managed to get through all that, congrats! You made it to the actual app, which is also long and annoying.

TrueOffMyChest,Had sex with my boyfriend,"It was his first time. I don't know if I should count it as mine due to losing my virginity to a girl, but she was a terrible person who tried calling it coercion so. Anyways, it was pretty great. We spent the whole day together, getting boba, going to the mall, watching Scream 6 in my room. He's a dorky guy who's shy when it comes to emotions, but he actually took a little initiative which I found pretty surprising, plus it turned me on. We made out after the movie and got a little touchy. My aunt and little sister were at the house, so he asked me ""Do you want to go to my car? We can do more there."" That line just makes me giggle, he's so cute and I didn't think he had it in him. Then again he's a 19 year old boy who was horny, so it makes sense. We did it in the back of his car. He's such a sweetheart oh my god I'm just gushing over how cute he is in my head. A friend had given me a condom a week ago when he heard we'd be alone together, and I'm forever thankful for that. When he finally made it inside of me and I moaned his name he stopped, I assume because he was worried he was hurting me. I reassured him, and we had a great night. I love my boyfriend

TrueOffMyChest,My daughter was SLAPPED by a boy at a powwow ,"This past weekend my daughter (12) and I were at a powwow. Yes, we are indigenous. 

My daughter is friends with a boy (13). They only hang out at tribal events as they go to different schools and live fairly far apart (we moved off the rez a couple years ago). 

I was honestly not a huge fan of their friendship in the first place because of issues with the boy’s family. But I wanted to be fair to my daughter and not interfere. 

I know the father is involved in selling drugs. That’s not me being judgmental - I know it. He also has a “legit” roofing business - they live a lot better than most people on the rez and this boy likes to brag about daddy’s money. 

This is a 13 year old boy who wears Canadian goose jackets. If you don’t know how expensive those are, he will let you know.

I know his mother because I used to work with her on the rez and we had our kids around the same time. When she got knocked up by this guy, I was disappointed. 

Years later, they have another child and she’s wearing Cartier bracelets. So I guess she’s okay with what he does to our community.

Anyway, my daughter went off with this boy and some other kids at the event. She runs back to me a couple hours later, in tears. She told me they were kissing, she decided she wanted to stop, and he slapped her across the face. She said he and his friends laughed when she got upset and said she was going to tell me. She said he told her to go ahead, his mom won’t care. 

This boy being problematic doesn’t shock me. But it going *this* far does. At 13 years old he’s being sexually violent toward another child? I feel horrible for my poor daughter.

After I calmed my daughter down and left her with a safe person, I did confront the boy’s mother, her son was with her. 

She says “I know, he told me”. She was talking to him like he was 5 years old. Think “say you’re sorry baby, you can’t hit anyone, okay?”. He rolled his eyes at her. 

It sucks because I want to be angry at this boy but it’s learned behavior. I wouldn’t be shocked if that woman is being beat, from what I know. 

I just want better for my daughter. That’s why I left. There’s so much toxicity. I hate that this happened to her, and I’ll just do my best to ensure it never does again. ",688,0.98,67,delph40,2024-12-02 19:34:35,1h5bvn2
TrueOffMyChest,My wife is stealing from big-box stores and it's my fault.,"A few days back I mentioned to my wife that our kids shoes were looking rough and that they needed a new pair before Christmas. She told me it wasn't in our budget (she handles all of our expenses) and I left it at that. I am currently working two jobs and honestly trying to get back on our feet after losing our apartment a few months back.

Yesterday she showed up with two boxes of shoes and a few grocery items from one of the big box stores that is local to us and immediately I asked her how she paid for it and she gave me a story about selling off some of her cryto holdings, as far as I knew we sold all of it already and honestly as she was telling me the story I could feel she was lying to me. When I pointed out that one of the pairs of shoes was the wrong size for daughter I suggested we go to the store together and exchange them, as far as I know you don't even need the receipt for this particular store to do it and she immediately said no and that she would take care of it.

Knowing I was onto something I pressed further and she began to cry, accusing me of not trusting her word. I stayed calm throughout and asked her point blank if she stole the shoes and the grocery items and after a few attempts and demanding that she let me look at her bank statement she finally caved and told me the truth. She stole it and has been stealing from a few different stores since last month, or so she says.

I work two jobs and she takes care of the kids and I guess what I am bringing in just doesn't cut it. I am devastated and honestly don't know what to do. If we take it back she will be in trouble so that is out of the question, I may just take it back and leave it on their customer service counter and walk away. Part of me knows we need it too. It's all my fault, all of this. I apologized to her, the fact that she couldn't talk to me about it and the fact that she felt she needed to do it means we are truly in desperation mode. I am going to work harder, hit up more food banks, and get my family out of this situation. My wife is a good person and the last few months have just messed her up emotionally. I will be better for them.",1130,0.96,213,Elgugugaga,2024-12-02 13:44:00,1h53rns

UnpopularOpinion,The Art of Flirting is Dead,"The Spiderman into the Spiderverse movie moment where the uncle of Miles teaches Miles how to flirt is going to keep living rent free in my head for a long time I feel. 

I think with both guys and girls, the art of flirting has been nigh extinct for a while now. 

Too often guys tell me ""I asked someone out I thought was flirting with me, and they rejected me"" or sometimes, they dont even consider the fact that she literally has not flirted with them at all. They mistake the girl being kind as flirting. 

I think the vice versa is true as well. Often my woman friends express frustration with thinking a guy was into them, only for the guy to pull away or disappear before they can go out, or they start avoiding contact with them. 

I talked with my mom about why neither she nor dad ever taught me how to flirt, and the response was ""we thought you would figure it out"". Unfortunately, I really dont see my peers actually flirting in public, so I never really picked it up from my environment, and like many others, tried weird self help videos and guides etc online to no avail. 

I asked one of my woman friends if guys flirt with her often, and she said no, point blank. Mind you, she is a very attractive person, and goes on dates with guys regularly, and has had multiple long term BFs. She claimed that most of the time, guys would just point blank ask her out on a date with no lead up, or build up beforehand. No little shoulder touches, compliments etc.

And if you are worried about being creepy, just note that flirting almost never is creepy if it only happens once or twice and isnt intense. Huge difference between something light and fun that can be brushed off or reciprocated and like ... actual SA

It feels more and more as time goes on, that the single people around me and online keep getting burned by either misreading flirting, or by not doing it, and that it is the core of having issues getting into a relationship. 

.

Edit: since this post is popping off, and im seeing a lot of comments on it, yea I get that my parents couldn't just ""teach"" me how to flirt lol. I believe there were warnings or things that could have saved my hardest crashes and burns from being as severe though. 

In Jr high, when I was a braindead idiot, I thought flirting was spending as much time as possible with the girl you like, so I followed the girl I liked around as much as possible, found her between classes and followed her around at lunchtime etc. It hit me like a MF TRUCK what I was doing when I was called a stalker by one of her friends. 

Thats something I feel my parents could have warned me about. Thats all I meant by the paragraph about my parents.

.

Edit 2: Okie yall, I guess I forgot to mention that I am fine in the flirting department, I dont need more comments telling me how to do it lol. I feel I do it well, but I keep hearing my single friends complain endlessly about not being able to land dates or whatever, and I always ask how they KNOW the other party is/was interested, and they almost never can give a reason.

Its both guys and girls. I made this post as an unpopular opinion, because I know many people don't feel flirting is essential, or dont feel like it is dying. There is data to back up that more people are lonely than ever before, and I feel thats in-part because they arent learning flirting skills from anywhere.

UnpopularOpinion,Warm soda is better than cold,"You get to taste the flavor so much more when it’s a room temperature or higher. There’s no rush to finish the drink before either the ice melts or it gets above the temperature that is acceptable to you. 

No need to fill up your fridge or worry about restocking after you pull one out. Just pile it up in your garage and that’s it. 

Feeling the syrup stick to the inside of your lips and teeth is a great feeling, just a little reminder of the delicious drink you just consumed (I brush my teeth often)

Pairing it with a warm meal is best. No more back and forth of hot mouth to cold mouth. Just a solid consistent temperature that, for me, seems to help with digestion compared to an ice cold drink.",202,0.8,67,ExtendedMacaroni,2024-12-02 19:30:30,1h5bslh

relationships,[F22] my bf (27M) cheated with my best friend (24F) but is more upset about my calm reaction,"**TL;DR**: my bf cheated on me with my best friend, confessed, and now he’s upset because im not reacting emotionally enough. instead of focusing on his betrayal, im focused on quietly planning my exit and moving on with my life.

a few days ago, my bf broke down and confessed that he cheated on me… with my best friend. he was crying, saying it was a mistake, begging for forgiveness, and acting like the world was ending. me? I just sat there, staring at him, feeling… nothing. no tears, no yelling, no heartbreak. just emptiness.

I think I’ve been emotionally checked out of this relationship for a while. his behavior had been off for months canceling plans, being evasive, acting like I was more of a burden than a priority so I’d already started distancing myself emotionally. when he dropped this bombshell, it felt more like confirmation than a shock.

as for my best friend, I’ll deal with her when the time is right. for now, im just done with both of them. it hurts, sure, but I dont have the energy to unpack all of that rn. I’ve got a lot going on im launching a new business, working long hours, and trying to set myself up for a better future. that matters so much more to me than their betrayal.

but here’s the kicker: he’s the one who’s upset. he keeps asking me why im not mad, why im not crying, and if I even care about him. he says things like, “dont u love me enough to fight for this?” and “why aren’t u more jealous or angry?”

I honestly think he’s more bothered by my calmness than he would be if I had screamed and thrown things. it’s like he wants me to make a scene so he can feel less guilty or justify his actions. sorry, but im not giving him that satisfaction.

I’ve already decided I’m leaving. I’ve started looking for a new place to live, and I’m quietly getting all my ducks in a row. rn, I just want peace and to focus on myself, but he won’t stop pestering me about my lack of a reaction. he’s even tried taking jabs at me, saying, “you’re so cold, no wonder this happened.” (srsly???)

I don’t care to fix this. I don’t care to fix him. I just want to get through this with as little drama as possible and move on.

how do I deal with him in the meantime? I feel like im being forced into a battle I don’t even want to fight.",335,0.97,77,MadamMoonlightGalax,2024-12-02 17:31:35,1h598ix
relationships,Resenting my partner now,"I have noticed that my (F36) partner (M35) always makes a comment such as “what do I get” or “you can have that but I want you to do something for me” if I ask for either a favour or he does something for me. 

I just seems like nothing is done from his heart anymore and comes with a price tag. It really makes me not want to ask for anything nor appreciate what he does because I get the “now I want” or “now what do I get” statement. 

I’m really starting to resent him now because of this. 

We both ordered new phones and I noticed that he ordered a screen protector pack that came with 3. I asked him if I could have one of them and he right away says, “you can, but what do I get?” 

Now I just would rather buy my own. 

I don’t know how to handle this at all. I confronted him about it and he gets really angry and defensive and says that I can’t take a joke. 

TL;DR,

My partner always makes a comment such as “what do I get” or “you can have that but I want you to do something for me” if I ask for either a favour or he does something for me.",156,0.93,65,bubble-24,2024-12-02 13:19:13,1h535le
relationships,My husband (33M) just asked me to quit my hobby and say goodbye to my hobby friends. I really don't want to say yes to that. What should I do?,"  
  


A bit of background story. My husband(33M) and I (31F) have been together for almost 8 years, married for 5. For the majority of my adulthood, I have been a bit of a malfunctioning adult in society (have not worked full time since 2015, have not worked at all since 2019) due to my severe depression. I’ve tried various therapy and meds, so far pretty treatment-resistant. Because of these things, my self-esteem has grown lower and lower to the point where I kind of only talk to my husband and have no other friends or family. (Now that I put it in words, it sounds so crazy but true.) My husband has been the only source of support, love, and friendship for the past 2 years or so. I should also mention that my husband is a very private person as well. He’s a big home boy and doesn’t really hang out with friends in real life, either. 

My husband, on the other hand, is a very intelligent person who makes a comfortable amount of money for the two of us. We don’t have kids yet. And we get to take seasonal vacations all over the place. I’ve been of course very grateful for all the hard work my husband has done. As far as my day goes, I do chores around the household and (try to) take care of everything at home. But some days, I just crash and lay in bed all day. My husband has tried to motivate and help me as much as possible to the point where I felt like he’d be better off without me and I’m holding him up for all the dreams he had of building a family and buying a home, etc. 

For the past couple of years, my husband’s approach of helping me has become gradually more authoritarian, almost like an authoritarian parenting style. Before you judge me, yes, i know it’s not the healthiest. But I’ve been so deep in my sad and numb head that I didn’t have the energy to even discuss alternatives. What I mean by him being authoritarian with me is,  for example, he has created a card system where I need to write down what I’m going to do next day (pretty basic household stuff) such as cooking 3 meals for 1h45mins, doing laundry for 1 hr, dishes for 0.5hrs, running 5k for 0.5hr….” etc. He’ll review and approve my agenda for the next day (with a minimum of 6hrs of stuff to do). If I can’t complete the things I said I’d do, he’ll punish me for it in a very parenting way - such as taking away my phone, ipad, game console, locking up my pet bunny, making me run extra miles, etc. I’d naturally resist and object to these commands at first, but over time, I’ve learned that the more I argue with him, the harsher his punishments would be. It’s pretty non-negotiable with him. 

His reasoning is that he’s trying to help me, and if I can’t do the things I promised I’d do, then that means I chose to not do those things and thus chose the consequences. I don’t agree with it, but like I said, I  haven’t really had the energy or will to debate with him when my head was in a bad place. I should also mention that English is my second language, and he’s a native speaker. And he’s a near-genius, I’m just generally smart. So there’s no way I could win arguments with him. 

Yes, I don’t disagree that I haven’t intellectually or socially grown much over the past 5 years at all. On a daily basis, I do consume a lot of social media and entertainment as a way of escaping my reality and coping with my pain. But my husband’s theory has always been “just do it” “just push it through” “it doesn’t matter if you’re tired you get things done anyways”. My husband complains about me consuming “garbage”, and asks me to only listen/read/watch somewhat educational things. I’m sorry I can’t. I just can’t. 

Apologizes for the long paragraphs. I think I’ve painted an overall picture of my marriage. Fast forward to this summer, I discovered an interest in watching table tennis games. I’ve watched a bunch of matches and learned a lot about the players and stuff. About a month ago, I met some fellow table tennis fans on a very friendly online platform (“小红书“ in Chinese), and quickly made some very good friends there. There’s one table tennis player I like a lot, so I kind of started a fan page on that social media platform. I’ve been talking to fellow fans daily, I’ve edited photos and videos for my posts for fun. This has been my painkiller for the last month. I’ve actually been extremely happy that I met some of the girls there. There’s one in particular which I’ve had lots of deep talks with, about life, marriage, politics, etc. I’ve been a bit of a social magnet there. I’m funny, creative, and very fun to talk to in the online world in my native language. But of course, all these things I’ve been doing behind my husband’s back. Why? Because he thinks watching sports is not helpful, and being a fangirl is a bit stalking-ish. So I’ve just told him that I’ve made some PingPong friends online and no more than that. 

Needless to say, I’ve spent a lot of my time on my PingPong friends and this fan page. He thinks I’m too addicted to it and I should quit it cold-turkey. He asked me to do it earlier today and was surprised that I didn’t want to say yes right away. Here’s why I don’t want to say yes to that, 1) this good friend I made online was the first close friend I’ve made in the last 8 years. Most of my friends are Chinese like me, my American husband doesn’t like that. He dislikes the fact that I consume a lot of Chinese stuff instead of English because we live in America. I really really don’t want to let go of this awesome person who’s become a good friend of mine. Because again, I don't talk to anyone besides my husband in real life. 2) I actually have this sociable and likeable online persona. It’s the first time I’ve felt like the old self in over a decade. It might be pitiful, but I actually have a good sense of self esteem in that safe and friendly pretty much all-female online community. It’s the happiest I have been for however long. I really don’t want to say goodbye to this. 

It feels to me that every time I discover something that makes me happy, my husband would take it away from me as a punishment of not getting the things done which I said I would. I know I’m pretty spoiled. I have never fully financially supported myself ever. But I don’t know, this just doesn’t feel right. My husband has complained about me not growing intellectually or cognitively, about me “regressing”, me being childish, spoiled, about me making excuses for things etc. They’re probably all true. 

Please be bluntly honest with me here. I just turned 31. I have nothing to show for. I’ve pretty much cut off contact with my family who deserve a much better daughter than me. I have no savings or money. I’m trying to build my life from where I am. I’m so lost in life. But I look around, I only have him. So I think I need a second opinion on things. Thanks for reading all of my rambling.

TrueAskReddit,Why do we laugh at the weak?,"As far as I can remember, whenever I go on social media there is always a clip that is viral of someone getting offended by something minuscule to which people laugh at and say “this offended generation”, “these snowflakes”, “people are so weak nowadays” and so on.

For me it is not laughable, it saddens me seeing somebody get so crazy about something. I always think what has happened in the life of somebody that mentally they are so weak? Nobody is born mentally weak, the world and life makes us like that. 

So now my question is, why do we laugh at those people? Why don’t we empathise as society and give those individuals the help they need? If people hate seeing other weak individuals, why do we let people get weak and then hate them for that same weakness? If weakness is such a hated trait wouldn’t it be ideal to eradicate it as a whole?",10,0.59,40,Theo04t,2024-12-01 04:48:33,1h40rep

Confession,"I write smut to work on my SA trauma and guilt, but can't tell anyone","I have an issue with being judged and shame. That comes from my childhood. Then I was SAd and it made it even worse. I stopped writing at all, even the most innocent stuff, because I could not stand someone finding it and reading it. And even when writing, I kept imagining somone I knew reading and reacting in real time.

I am in therapy and it's some progress. I was post therapy session with that weird lucidity when I decided I was going to write an erotic scene and be shameless about it. On a notebook, for myself, to write about something no one ever will read. Everytime the thought of someone else reading it came up, I ignored it with all the willpower I had.

I ended up writing a hell long and detailed story, which is not even the worst thing you will find on wattpad if we are being honest. I'm sure many would consider it pretty vanilla. Still I felt so scandalized when I read it again later. 

But I guess it's progress? I am writing, I am not judging myself and I am letting myself explore a side of me I repressed so long out of fear... So yeah I can't tell this to people and needed to let it out. And NO I won't post it anywhere. I have the notebook hidden better than it would be an actual sex toy.

**Non-Story Text Within the Story** 

Just post the story. That's all we want. We don't need commentary about it being your first story, what inspired you, disclaimers telling the audience this is a true story, ""THE END"" at the end, repeating the title, the author name. Anything supplemental can be posted in the comment section.

**Stand Alone Stories Only** 

No multi-part stories, no sequels, prequels, interquels, alternative viewpoint stories, links to previous stories for reference, or anything that builds off of or depends on some other story you’ve written.

The story begins and ends within the 500 words or less you are allotted.

**All Stories Must Be Horror and/or Thriller Themed** 

We ask that authors focus on creating stories within horror and thriller stories. You may borrow from other genres, but the main focus of the story **MUST** be to horrify, scare, or unsettle. Stories with jokey punchline will be removed. We shouldn't be laughing at the end of the story. Stories dealing with depression, suicide, mental illness, medical ailments, and other assorted topics belong over on /r/ShortSadStories. However, this doesn't mean you cannot use these topics in your stories. There's a delicate balance between something horrifying and sad. If we can interpret the story as being scary, we will do so. 

Please note that badly written stories, don't necessarily fall under this category. The story can be terrible, but still be focused on horror. 

___________________
**No Plagiarism** 

All stories must be an original work. Stories written by AI are not allowed. Stories must be submitted by the authors who wrote the story. Do not steal other users' stories. No fan-fiction allowed. Repeat offenses will result in a ban. If someone can find your story somewhere else, it will be removed. This rule also applies to famous or common stories that you’ve merely reworded slightly. This does not apply to famous stories you’ve reworked considerably, such as a fresh take on a fairytale or urban legend. The rule of thumb is that the more you alter the text to make the story your own, the more lenient we’ll be.

**Rape/Pedophilia/Bestiality/Torture Porn/Gore Porn are Off-Limit Topics**

The intent of this ban is to prevent bad actors from exploiting this sub as a delivery system for their fantasies, which would bring the tone down, and alienate the reader base who don’t want to be exposed to such material. We acknowledge that this ban throws out the baby with the bath water, as well-made stories that merely happen to have such themes will get removed as well. But if we let in the decent stories with such content, those bad actors can point at them and demand to know why those stories get to stay and not theirs. Better by far to head the issue off entirely with a hard ban and stick to it.
___________________
**24 Hour Rule**

Authors must wait 24 hours between submissions. This is intended to prevent prolific writers from crowding out others from the front page by spamming the sub. It is likely if you mistime it, you’ll be able to copy/paste and resubmit your story once the 24 hours has passed.
___________________
**Exceptionally Poor Quality Stories May Be Removed** 

We reserve the right to remove any story that fails to use proper grammar, has frequent typos, or is in general just a poorly composed story. This is relative, and we will use that right as sparingly as possible. Walls of text will automatically be removed.
___________________
**No Obnoxious Commentary** 

This includes, but is not limited to: bigotry/hate speech, personal insults, exceptionally low quality feedback, antagonistic behavior, use of slurs, etc. Use your best judgement. Mod response will take the form of a spectrum ranging from a mild warning to a permaban, depending on the context. Incidentally, the lowest response we have to mod abuse is banning, because we quite literally don’t need to put up with it.

We reserve the right to lock any thread that veers off topic into some controversial subject, such as politics or social commentary. This is simply not the venue for it.

**Links to Author Collectives with Restricted Submissions and/or curated content cannot be advertised on SSS.**

We've noticed authors posting links to personal subreddits and in the same comment section post a link to a subreddits for an author collective. Normally, these author collectives have restricted submissions and curated content while SSS is free and open to everyone for posting. It seems a bit rather unfair for these author collectives to build their readership off /r/ShortScaryStories. While we wish to allow individual authors to build a readership off their own work, we will no longer allow author collectives with restricted submissions or curated content to advertise on /r/ShortScaryStories.

ShortScaryStories,November 2024 Contest!,"Much like our last contest, I want to do something *majorly* different from our previous November Contests. Writing stories about Thanksgiving is getting a bit stale. Let’s do something fresh and exciting this time around! Gobble gobble!
I’d like to play a little game. It’s called:

**Modifiers!**

If you’re any kind of gamer, you’ll understand this right off the bat. If you aren’t, no worries. I’ll be explaining below in simple terms how this is all going to work.
___________________________________

##THEME


**Modifiers**


For this contest, there will be no theme! Authors can write about whatever they want. Of course, within the subreddit rules. However, it wouldn’t be much of a contest if there wasn’t some added difficulty. 

In this case, the difficulty of the story will also be the author’s choice, in the form of the following list of modifiers:

(1x) **Old School SSS** – Author can only use 250 words or less

(2x) **Drabble Babble** – Stories must be 100 words EXACT. Anything over or less will count solely toward the Old 
School SSS modifier 

(2x) **You Did It!** – Story must be told from 2nd Person Point of View. For example, “You walk up to a tree and smack it in its lying face. It smacks you back with a branch. It hurts you a ton, but you don’t give a damn.” 

(3x) **Rhyme Time** – Story must be told in the form of a Poem. It does not need to rhyme. Just freestyle it. 

(2x) **Stories within Stories** – Story must be told in the form of vignettes. For example, an end of the world scenario told from the point of view of different characters. 

(1x) **Short & Literary** – Titles must not exceed 5 words and cannot be clickbait or summarizing or overly descriptive. Yes, this is subjective, however, we all know clickbait when we see it. 

(3x) **Original Monster** – Story must contain an original creature/monster. From the results of the Halloween contest, I’d say everyone deserves a second chance at this. Subjective as well, but that’s why it’s a 3x multiplier. 

(1x) **Genred** – Stories must contain an additional genre besides horror. Fantasy, science fiction, romance, etc, are all on the table, but remember that horror comes first and foremost. 

(1x) **Keywords** – **ALL**  of the following words must appear in the story – Midnight, Titanium, Dove, Carnage, Crimson. 

(1x) **Celebrate!** – Story must be holiday-themed. Simply mentioning it’s Valentine’s Day won’t cut it. You’ve gotta make the holiday central to the story. 

(4x) **Nice try, Rookie!** – Story must be submitted on a Throwaway account. Throwaway accounts may not reveal any identifying information about the author. It is supposed to be anonymous to level the playing field for those who are not popular authors. 


Authors may use as many modifiers as they like. Or none of the modifiers. Isn’t that interesting? 


Well, there’s a catch. 


If you noticed, there’s a 1X, 2X, 3X, or 4X next to each modifier. For each modifier used, the author will receive a multiplier. This multiplier will come from the additive total of modifiers used in their story. Once the multiplier is confirmed, it will then be used against the total amount of upvotes the story received resulting in a total amount of points the story will receive. 


For example, I submit a story with 5 1x modifiers and this story receives 100 upvotes. The total number of points the story will receive is 500. Or if I write a story with 3 1x modifiers and the 4x modifier, and get 100 upvotes, it’ll be 700 points. If I don’t use any modifiers, and my story gets 1000 upvotes, my total points is 1000. 


The author whose story scores the most **points** at the end of the contest will be declared the winner. 
As mentioned above, there are some modifiers up there which could be considered subjective. For example, original monsters, no clickbait, holiday, and genre. However, if you choose to use these modifiers, I suggest **leaning heavily into them** so there can be no question about it.


If you used the Drabble Babble modifier, you’ll automatically also get the Old School SSS modifier too for a total 3X modifier. 


If there are any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask. This is the first time I’m doing this type of contest, and I probably haven’t worked out all the kinks yet.

##RULES AND REGS


* All entries must adhere to the subreddit rules. Entries not meeting the guidelines will be disqualified and removed.


* To participate in the contest, a link to the story submission must be made to the /r/ShortScaryStoriesOOC thread for the [November 2024 Contest]( https://old.reddit.com/r/ShortScaryStoriesOOC/comments/1gvuem4/november_2024_contest_submissions/) Leave a comment with a link to the story, and that's all. If you have multiple submissions, please go back to your comment and add additional links. It's easier to organize this way.


* Authors must state the modifiers they’re using in the comment section of the story. This is super important so the point totals can be accurate, and I know what I’m looking for when reading through the story. 


* If a modifier is selected and not featured in the story or doesn’t adequately satisfy the requirements, it will not be to calculate the point total. 


* Multiple entries are allowed. Please remember the 24 Hour rule. Even if using a throwaway account, please wait 24 hours on the normal account. 


* The story with **the most points** is the winner. The calculation is listed above. If there are any ties or if Reddit's vote fudging makes determining a placement too tricky, authors will split the placement, and the next highest upvoted story will take the subsequent placement until we have a full winner's circle.


* An additional winner will be selected as well. This will be a Moderator's Choice Award. This will be given to a story which might not have cracked the Top 5 in points (or maybe it did!), but shows excellence in creativity, originality, and writing. If there's a tie, it might be possible to have multiple winners on this one.

* Point calculations will be done after the event is completed so there aren't any significant shifts in the upvote counts.

ShortScaryStories,My husband is hiding a grave secret.,"“Hey honey, how was your day,” my husband greeted me after getting home from a long day of work.



“It was fine,” I said, revealing a bouquet of flowers.



“Are those for me?” My husband asked, confused. 



“I thought we could deliver them together.”



“Deliver them?”



“Yeah, to your late wife’s grave.”



My husband couldn’t hide the shock on his face.



“How’d you find out?” My husband took the flowers from me.



I pulled out a receipt for a burial plot.



“I went to the cemetery, Paul. You bought the grave next to her? I knew you were married before but you never said she died.”



“I don’t like to talk about it. It was sudden.”



I crumpled up the receipt. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to bring up the *real* reason I was angry. I didn’t mind that my husband lied about his late wife passing away. It was probably none of my business.



No, what made me upset was that he wanted to be buried next to *her* and not me.



“You don’t have to talk about it if you’re not ready, but I want you to know that I will always be here to listen. Why don’t we take the first step and deliver these?” I pointed to the flowers.



“Yeah,” my husband said, “I’d like that.”



We got in the car and drove to the cemetery together. My husband walked me to his late wife’s grave, only the burial plot next to it had been recently dug out.



“I wonder why they dug it up?” I laughed and smiled at my husband. “You plan on dying any time soon?”



My husband pulled out a blackjack from his pocket and struck me in the back of the head.



“I didn’t buy it for me,” he said. ",743,0.99,20,ForgottenWell,2024-12-02 08:00:55,1h4vle1
ShortScaryStories,Five…Four…Three…Two…,"Jennifer Williams sat in her office, reading mail and doing payroll. She wished she didn’t have to pay the losers who worked for her, but such was the cost of running a business. She opened an envelope absent-mindedly while she worked. Then she got up, left her store, and walked into traffic, killed immediately by a speeding semi. She wasn’t missed. 

——-

Mike Warren came home from his late shift. A dead-end warehouse job wasn’t what he had in mind for his life; he felt like he was going nowhere. At least those other losers treated him with the respect he deserved - they’d pay if they didn’t. He opened his mail while heating up dinner: meatloaf tonight. Then he opened his fifth-floor window and jumped to the pavement below. The microwave beeped. 

——-

Anna Stinson entered the apartment she shared with her roommate. She sighed - it was a disaster, as always. She wished her roommate would clean, but it was what she could afford. She knew she should be grateful - many of her classmates didn’t have apartments at all. She kicked off her heels, sat on the couch, and went through her mail - more bills. Then she went to the bathroom, filled the tub with water, and submerged her head until she drowned. Her roommate would find her - she had to clean up the mess. 

——-

Ethan Thompson watched his students leave the classroom. As usual, they understood nothing except how to make excuses. Always excuses. They were lazy and entitled - none of them deserved to pass. He perused his correspondence, expecting another entitled parent demanding special treatment for their “angel.”  After a moment, he picked up a pencil and shoved it through his eye and into his brain. Blood dripped down onto the essay beneath him like red ink. 

——-

Clarissa Wallace turned off the news in her office. She’d canceled her remaining appointments for the day to appreciate this moment. She reviewed her notepad:

*Jennifer Williams - Boss who fired you. Trigger Word: Titanium. Dead.*

*Mike Warren - Classmate who bullied you. Trigger Word: Carnage. Dead.*

*Anna Stinson - Girlfriend who dumped you. Trigger Word: Dove. Dead.*

*Ethan Thompson - Teacher who failed you. Trigger Word: Crimson. Dead.*

She checked off the last name and pulled out the picture of her brother. Staring at it, she lit a flame under the list, watching it burn and remembering all of the sessions she’d held as she’d planted the needed post-hypnotic suggestions. The years of school, the months of planning - all worth it. All of the people who’d contributed to her brother’s suicide were dead. 

All except one. 

She kissed the picture, then rose and walked to her office mirror. “I’m sorry
I wasn’t there for you, Mikey. I'm sorry I didn’t see how much pain you were in. I hope you can forgive me.”

Then she looked into her own eyes, raised the gun, and said the final trigger word. 

*”Midnight.”*

ProRevenge,Cheat on your wife with mine? I will burn your life to the ground. ,"Way back in the early 2000’s, I began to suspect that my wife was up to something. Our two kids were about 4 and 6, still young, but not so young they couldn’t tell you something about what had happened in their day. They started talking a lot about staying with my wife’s parents during the day which wasn’t really that strange in and of itself, but since they lived about 90 minutes away, doing so two or three times a week seemed a bit much (that was basically every day she wasn’t working at her part time job). 

When I asked her about it, she denied it, but was never a good liar. So, I started tracking the mileage on her car and sure enough, she was driving an extra 400 or so miles per week. I knew some shit was going on. 

Then one day I sat down at the computer and she had left a sticky note with her AOL password written on it next to the keyboard. I could not resist and logged in to read her emails and saw a few email exchanges between her and her college BFF where they discussed how my wife was regularly fucking one of her ex bf’s from high school.  No mention of details about him other than my wife also talking shit about his wife making fun of how she’d gotten fat after having kids. Anyway, I printed out these email exchanges and stashed them. 

I still needed to know the details, so I called a friend who was a cop and he suggested I call a guy he knew that had left the force to become a PI. “Ron” was great, I paid his retainer and gave him the emails and what little I knew about my wife’s activities and he figured out exactly what she was doing. His report detailed with photos and times/dates/locations all about how she would take the kids to her parent’s, then go meet this guy for lunch, then they’d go to a dumpy motel for a few hours, after which she’d pick up the kids and return home. 

At this point, I hired a divorce lawyer. My parents cheated on each other and the fallout absolutely fucked mine and my siblings’ childhood. It was something that was totally unacceptable. 

I also asked Ron to find out what he could about this guy. Ron absolutely came through. I learned his name (“Bob”) , that he was married and had 3 kids. I also found out that he worked as a VP of sales for his father in law’s business. Hmmmm. 

At this point, I had my lawyer draw up the  divorce papers. I also asked Ron for a couple more copies of his report and I one more thing I wanted him to do for me. 

On the same day I had my wife served with the divorce papers at her work, I had Ron meet with this guy’s wife and show her everything he’d found out. She seemed nice and I figured that she deserved to know what her dear hubby was up to. What she did with that information was up to her. 

While the information about my wife’s infidelity didn’t really matter in my divorce proceedings, Bob’s wife did a real number on him. According to the publicly available court documents from the divorce and other related proceedings, she cleaned out their joint account, took the kids and left. As soon as her dad found out what he’d done, Bob was fired and since her parents actually owned the house where Bob and his wife lived, he also got evicted. Their divorce was ugly. Lots of fighting in ( and evidently out of) court. I guess Bob went to the house and started arguing with his wife and it escalated to the point the her brother stepped in and Bob got his nose broken. There were restraining orders, a few more incidents with police reports, criminal charges, jail time and so on. 

I can’t find Bob on the internet anywhere these days. Last I heard, he’d left the state and His ex wife did ok, she went to work at her dad’s company and took over after he retired. 

As for me, my ex and I got along well enough, I didn’t engage with her on anything that wasn’t related to the kids and now that they’re both adults, I don’t talk to her at all anymore. I don’t hate her or anything, but I only care in the context that she is my kids’ mom and is important to them, nothing beyond that. ",9350,0.97,220,Broad_Adz,2024-11-17 13:23:54,1gtlcm5
ProRevenge,"Neighbor was stealing water from my supply, so I ruined him.","I live in Asia, and just purchased a new house. Now, the previous owners were family friends who needed cash urgently and haven't been living in my country for nearly 3 years. So I got it for a great price in the middle of the capital city.

The sale was finalized at the start of this month and I moved in right after. The house was definitely a fixer upper, as the previous owners had left mid renovation and the main door was locked with just a padlock, not even a door lock. 

The house had no gate, meaning anyone could just walk right on in. The first day I moved in, someone's bike was parked in the garage. I just parked it on the road on the same day I had a gate installed. An angry man was knocking on my gate later and I didn't bother answering, but through my window I could see him giving up and taking the bike after 15 minutes. 

So already, I wasn't digging the neighborhood. But I didn't have any incidents after that, aside from people not knowing that this was no longer an abandoned house, so my gate was blocked more often than never but a ""No Parking"" sign on my gate fixed that issue. 

Last week, I was having a shower in my bathroom and I noticed my water pressure was lower than usual. I also heard my next door neighbors water pump going. Now this neighbor, an old guy, lived in a 3 storied house, the first being the lowest and the one he lived in. The other two floors were rented out to tenants. 

This guy wasn't happy about the house being sold, and voiced many concerns to my friends the previous owners. He was super angry about it, and my friends did warn me but I'm a 6ft guy with 3 dogs. No way he was doing anything and yep, he didn't. 

So with this living situation, a water pump is needed to pump water to the tanks on the roof, since the public supply's pressure is not enough to get it up 3 stories. 

Now, I heard the water pump going and immediately was suspicious. Sure, coincidences exist, but it wouldn't hurt to check it out. I waited till his pump turned off, and then turned on different taps in the house. Sure enough, the pressure was back to normal. 

This made me even more suspicious, but if he was stealing water, it also made sense. The water bills had been going up over the years this house wasn't lived in, but the house also had some water leaks. So it was chalked up to that, even if the bills were too high to be caused just by leaks. Now it's starting to make sense. 

At some point in the last 3 years, this old miser thought he'd save the cost of paying for water, and waltzed into the property and is siphoning water from my lines. I couldn't find where exactly he was siphoning water from, but after checking my pressure multiple times, I was pretty sure.

So I sat on it for a few days, thinking if I should confront him, go the legal path or just let it be. Now, water in my country is very cheap. My total bill, even with washing 3 animals, a car every week and watering my garden only cost like $5 per month, even with the neighbor also stealing some of it. 

But it wasn't about how much I was paying or who was paying for it. It's about entitled old people who think that they're deserving of using other people's resources without paying for it, and then getting away with it. It didn't sit right with me, and I really wanted to teach him a lesson. 

What I did was really simple. I just turned off my water from the mains. I wouldn't have to break into his property, nor would I be breaking any laws. It was the best way of getting back at him without needing to even lift a muscle. 

So on Monday, just 4 days ago, I waited till the pump flicked on, and turned off the supply. Now, the way household tanks work in my country, is that there's a ball valve in the tank which detects the level of water and turns on the pump. If the level doesn't increase, the valve stays open which electronically sends a signal to the pump to stay on until the level gets to a point at which the valve closes and also shuts off the pump. 

However, the level wasn't increasing and anyone knows that starving a pump of water isn't a good idea. This way, my expectation was that I'd burn out his pump and cause issues with his tenants. 

What I didn't account for is that his pump running constantly would mess up the fuses by constantly drawing power overnight and absolutely destroy his wiring. If he decided to upgrade his household wiring to a more modern standard, this would've been prevented. This house clearly still had 90s era wiring. 

At around 3AM, I heard all residents in the house waking up and talking in hushed voices about why just their house in the neighborhood doesn't have power or water. I found out about the power part, because the tenants devolved into shouting at their landlord. 

Our tenant protection laws are very important, and power and water are classed as essential even on a state level. Cutting those services are grounds for lawsuits, unless due to weather or some other unavoidable reason. 

In this case, the landlord is responsible for keeping the house wiring up to date and in good condition, alongside the supply of water. So the tenants were not happy and one of them immediately moved out two days later when it was informed that water and power will not be returning the very same day this happened. 

Both tenants in the two floors lodged a complaint with the police, and if a person is in clear breach of laws, the police have the authority to fine or penalize the person without a court judgment. It can be challenged in court if the person thinks that they were unfairly penalized, but they still have to pay the fines and will only be refunded if and when the court finds the fines unlawful.

So now, the landlord lost both tenants and has to pay a fine of $500, which is a lot of money in our country. He also has to refund the security deposits of both tenants, and cannot rent out until both issues are fixed, which will cost him more money. 

As of right now, he's moving out on Sunday to his daughter's place since he cannot afford to live alone. The tenants were his only source of income, and he's a retired mechanic, so he has no other income. 

He did find out why the motor kept drawing power, overloaded the wiring and burned out. He came by to my gate and asked me if I turned off my water, and I said ""oh yeah, my tank had a new leak on a pipe and I turned it off till the next day until the plumber came by to fix the issue"".

Y'all, the look on his face. He kept a straight one, but I just knew he was holding back. He just said ""oh okay"" and went back inside. Not sure if he knows I know, but I don't care because he can't do anything. 

I'm getting a plumber down next week to correct my plumbing and remove any pipes that leave my property. So I got rid of my water issue and a neighbor who could potentially be a pain in the ass, by simply flicking a tap off. Two birds one stone I'd say. 

TLDR: Bought an abandoned house, neighbor was siphoning water from my supply. Turned off my water supply when the motor was running, motor burned out the wiring in the house and cut off water and power to him and his tenants. Tenants lodged police complaints and the landlord got fined, is now destitute and forced to move in with his daughter.",13101,0.97,270,TheMusicFella,2024-11-07 16:15:05,1gm2riq
ProRevenge,"If you're gonna steal the catalytics off my truck you should've checked if they were actually functional first, wasn't so funny when it was turn.","Was a fun morning at the beginning of last week starting up my truck and waking everyone up at 2:45am to learn someone swiped the hollowed out cats. The idiots missed the neighbors cameras that basically gave away who they were. Its two kids from the area who drive around in a pretty busted up police crown vic. I chose not to call the cops, instead I called one of my friends who's code enforcement and let him know what my plan was and he relayed the info to the police that I was finally going to do a nuisance tow on that same crown victoria 


The car they drive isnt street legal as it has no license plates or insurance or working taillights and rattles like shit due to the trash sound system they also spend their whole day at a chicken shack smoking. Not sure who theyre getting money from but I'm guessing stealing catalytics was part of the equation. When I spotted the car sitting on a quiet street I called it in and got the go ahead to tow. I took it straight to the police station and they tried to run a owner check with the vin number only to find out it hadn't been registered since 2011 and the owner was someone other than the kids who sold them the car with no title because of all the back registration  owed 


 The cops said we can go ahead and take it to the junkyard til they can get a Black title(aka certificate of destruction). By then the two idiots were running around all over town looking for their car thinking it got stolen by one of their friends as a prank(the key lock was so worn out you could start it with any car key). They found it at the junkyard and tried to steal it by one of them distracting the owner and the other stealing their car but the junkyard was aware of who they were so they cut the driveshaft off beforehand.
 

I missed out on this part but they got arrested for trying to steal their car back and they watched as the junkyard used a crane to rip the car to shreds when I saw it the remains looked like a toddler just ripped it to the bare frame out of curiosity. They been out of jail since but haven't left their trailer, i did a drive by earlier and noticed a beater jeep liberty in their driveway also with no plates and already working with the cops on taking that too if I see it out in a public except I won't miss the show next time.

ProRevenge,Tricking My Slacker Coworker into Sabotaging Himself,"I work in an office with a guy I’ll call “Seth.” Seth is that coworker everyone knows: lazy, always passing his work onto someone else, and somehow always getting away with it. He’ll sit around on his phone or go to the bathroom every 10 minutes. He’s the kind of guy who will show up late, make some lame excuse about traffic, and then disappear for “lunch” for two hours.

He’ll send emails asking if I can “help out” with a project, but what he really means is, “do all the work while I take the credit.” I complained to my boss a couple of times, but somehow Seth always managed to weasel his way out of trouble. The final straw came when he passed off a major report that was due to a client in two days, dumping it on me last minute.

One day I casually asked him if he was good with Excel, and he admitted he didn’t know much about it. Perfect. The next time Seth tried to dump a bunch of spreadsheets on me to organize for his next report, I agreed. But this time, I embedded a series of *hidden formulas* into the documents. These formulas didn’t do anything important, just enough to mess with the numbers if someone didn’t know how to check for hidden cells. It took me a little time, but I was careful not to make it too obvious. The kicker? Every time Seth tried to copy and paste the data into his report, it would scramble everything just enough to be completely useless.

On the day the report was due, Seth slacked off like usual, assuming I had handled it like always. When the client called, furious because the report was filled with nonsense numbers, Seth panicked. He rushed to fix it, but every time he tried to fix one part of the report, something else would break. He came to me, frantic, and asked for help. I acted confused and said, “Oh, I don’t know what happened! Maybe it’s a glitch?” I gave him some vague advice and watched as he spent the entire day trying to salvage his mess.

Our boss found out, and for once, Seth couldn’t talk his way out of it. He got lambasted for screwing up such an important project and was put on temporary leave without pay. I guess he’ll be doing his own work from now on.",7538,0.97,165,SeagullFanClub,2024-09-24 22:33:14,1fova4p
NuclearRevenge,About r/NuclearRevenge,"Welcome to Nuclear Revenge! Here, users will share personal extreme revenge stories that exceed the mild intent of most revenge, often in a ridiculous and even nefarious manner that will surely end badly for someone.

If you are wondering about the name of this subreddit. Nuclear Revenge is simply metaphorical. Resorting to the use of nuclear weapons would be a pretty extreme form of retaliation. And we are looking for some serious retaliation stories.

**Notice:**

1. This subreddit is not for those who are easily offended. If you feel the need to be rude to another user over the content in their story, please leave.
2. Do not ask to be a mod. We will make an announcement if we are looking for a new mod.
3. Moderators may still remove a post or a comment at their own discretion even if it does not directly violate any of our listed rules. Be mindful of what you say and do in this subreddit.
4. It's understandable if you're unsure of whether or not a story is suitable for this subreddit. If so, feel free to message the mods and we will help you determine if the story is suitable or not.

**Important Information:**

* Stories of getting revenge on a school bully violate Rule 2 and do not belong here. Do not post them.

NuclearRevenge,Reminder: Criteria For User Comments,"Hello! This is a reminder to remain respectful when leaving comments or sending messages to other users or our mod team.

Recently, we had to lock a few posts due to a lot of misbehavior in the comments. Eventually, we decided to unlock them after clearing up the comments. Do not make us regret this decision.

While I’m at it, I might as well provide some criteria for leaving comments in general. 

**So, what kind of comments are allowable?**

• Compliments
• Questions
• Respectful Criticism/Observations (this helps us review posts)

**Now, what kind of comments are not allowable?**

• Insults
• Rude Criticism
• Wasteful/Low Effort Comments (that don’t contribute whatsoever)

**What about miscellaneous comments that are unrelated to the post?**

• We will decide to approve or remove these kind of comments at our own discretion. But most of the time, it should be fine. 

As a side note: In most cases, bad comments are simply removed with no further action. But in some cases, users may also be banned. 

FYI: In case of ban bypassing, we do observe posts and comments made by new accounts. This is an alternative to restricting the new accounts entirely.

•••

If you have questions regarding any of this then feel free to ask.

Thanks,

- The Mod Team",119,0.95,10,claycam6,2023-08-28 14:20:59,163v9oo
NuclearRevenge,Revenge on a hacker,"One day I get an email from a hosting provider telling me that attacks are being launched from our server and I need to look into it.

I find that there is indeed a hacker in our server. He was using an app to anonymously control his bot network, among other things.

I looked at the app he was using, and discovered that it was an opensource project. I then downloaded the code for this backdoor, modified it to log everything to a file, and replaced his app with my honeypot version.

Over the next six months I collected every scrap of information I could on this guy. I then used that information to take over many of his online accounts, including his main email account. That was the account where he had registered all of his services to, so I was able to issue password reset requests for everything he owned. I gained control of six other email accounts, two dozen IRC accounts, his facebook page, his dating profile, numerous websites, and the backup site he used for his cell phone. I have his phone number, his moms number, and his girlfriends number. I know his address, his birthday, the schools he went to, even his favorite foods and music.

After I took every single online account he had ever had away from him, I sent a nasty email to his ISP in an effort to extort yet more information from them. In that email I said some very unkind things about the monarch of Indonesia and how I might smear the monarch publicly if I didn't get the information.

The hacker dispeared immediatly after that. I have looked for him at times over the last fifteen years since and he has not resurfaced. The Indonesian lèse-majesté laws regarding insults to the monarchy are not to be trifled with. The prison term for such an offense is 15 years.",2010,0.96,96,DavesPlanet,2024-09-30 19:00:05,1ftajvn
NuclearRevenge,Revenge on an animal abuser ,"One day I was on my evening walk with my dog and we came across a small dog standing in the middle of the street shaking. It’s hair was matted, had mange, ridden with fleas, one eye swollen and sealed shut with mucus, nails so long it was walking on the back of its paws, malnourished, and quivering. I was shocked. 

I called my wife to bring me a blanket and come pick us up. While I was waiting, the door of the house in front of us opened, and out came a disheveled looking older man. He started calling for the dog to come inside. I absolutely lost it. I screamed at him asking if it was his dog and he replied it was. I asked him why it was in such bad shape and he said “she’s sick and won’t eat”. I yelled at him there was no fucking way in the world I was letting him take her back inside. The shouting match lasted long enough for a few neighbors to come outside. (Who later told me he had another dog in the house). Eventually my wife pulls up and I wrap the doggo in the blanket and go home. 

I looked up the name of our local no kill shelter but they were closed until the following day. My wife and I decided to call her Sally. I gave Sally a bath and went and bought some wet food since she wouldn’t eat dry kibble. She devoured it. I set her up a nice sleeping area in the garage for her to spend the night. 

1st thing in the morning I took Sally to the shelter and called animal control and told them what happened. They went to check her out, took a statement from me, and ended up at his house confiscating his other dog. Unfortunately Sally was put down due to the horrible shape it was in (she was also very old). 

Here’s where the revenge begins. 

This old assholes house was on the route I took to walk my dog twice a day. My dog liked to take a dump about two houses before we reached his. Perfect! Now I didn’t need to carry bags of shit all the way back to my house! I started tossing them on his roof twice a day. At first he would climb a ladder around once a week to get them down, but eventually I broke his will to do that. This went on for about a year before I moved. His roof was covered in shit bags. 

I also printed out flyers with his address and pictures of how I found Sally and put them in all the neighbors mailbox’s. 

I live across town now, but every couple months I ride by and toss a bag of dogshit on his roof to let him know I’m still thinking about Sally. ",1478,0.95,44,BalloonKnotBandit,2024-09-22 18:24:32,1fn6ndp
LifeProTips,A Quick Reminder: We have a strictly NO POLITICS rule in this subreddit.,"Hey everyone, just a quick reminder that we have a strict No Politics rule in the LifeProTips subreddit. 

While we encourage sharing helpful tips for everyday life, discussions related to politics, political figures, or current political events are not allowed.


Let's keep the focus on practical advice and positive discussions. Thanks for helping maintain a helpful, inclusive space for everyone!

LifeProTips,"LPT: When you're feeling low, do something productive you don't like","I have realised i don't like to clean utenils or mop the floor but I know these things are great and need to be done but they are miserable, so just do the more miserable things when you're low, it will make being miserable less hurtful.

Same principle is the reason why people workout or go for a run.

Other activities you could do could be-

1. Organize your wardrobe

needadvice,[Mod Post]| Updated Sub-Reddit Rules!,"#Posting Guidelines 

* Posters and commenters must now have an account at least 15 days old with atleast 50 comment karma. These will be automatically removed if you do not meet the requirements.

* Do not submit a post with a title in all caps, or a blank post with just a title. These will be removed automatically.

* Please be specific with your headline rather than just saying you need advice, make it clear in your post about what you need help/advice about.

* No polls or surveys.

#Rules

**Below are the rules of this sub. Disregarding any of these rules may result in a ban. Both posts and comments are subject to all rules.**

1. Nothing personal relationship, sex, or dating related or anything about stalking a person. Even commenting on these threads is a grounds for a ban.

— /r/needadvice is a subreddit for getting advice about things going on in our lives outside of our relationship with significant others, potential significant others, and significant others of days past. Your relationship, your parent's relationships, your friend's relationships... if you are dealing with any person's romantic relationship, it doesn't belong in here. (This is code for ""no romance related stuff"") No dating advice. No hookup advice. No sex related advice, including anything involving rape (even if it happened to you), molestation, or underage sexual activity.

2. Nothing about personal messaging each other - Don't ask or tell posters or other commenters to PM, DM, or inbox you.

3. No sharing/posting to drama subs - Anybody cross posting any threads to the drama causing subs (subreddit drama, any of the SRS, just anything to increase the drama in a thread) will be banned. That just won't be tolerated at any level. Don't tattle on the mods of other subs here either.

4. No revenge submissions - No ""How to get even"" at all, not in submissions, not in comments.

5. No threadjacking or comment qualifiers - Stay focused on OP's problem. If you disagree with someone else's advice, offer some advice of your own with a top level comment instead of debating. If you agree with someone's advice and have nothing to add, just upvote it.

6. No misogyny, misandry, racism, religious intolerance, or similar - Respect one another, even those you disagree with. We're all equal here. It does not matter if you're male, female, null, both, or nongendered. It does not matter where your come from, or what color your skin is. When meeting someone from a different walk of life, treat that person as you would like them to treat you.

7. No lying advice - Don't ask how to lie, don't advise on lying.

8. No references to suicides - Anything related to suicidal ideations are not allowed. For the sake of yours or your family/friend's safety, anything mentioning suicide needs to go to /r/SuicideWatch

9. No soliciting items or funds - Since we allow throwaways, don't solicit money in here. Please view any effort to solicit money in here as a scam. But any need for donations can go to /r/assistance or /r/care.

10. No advertising - Do not link your subreddit (unless it is relevant to the subject matter of the post), your youtube page, your personal website, clickbait, or stuff for sale. Mods are the arbiters of what constitutes advertising.

11. Kinda Safe for work - We know that lots of controversial and personal things get talked about here, and that's fine. Try to keep your titles safe for work by avoiding foul language and graphic descriptions.

12. Nothing about missing persons - Don't ask about how to track someone down or find someone you used to know.

13. No stand-alone jokes. A joke with legitimate advice is fine, but not by itself.

#Ban Appeals

* For ban appeals: Do not delete any of your comments and posts, especially if they were removed by the mods. Deleting submissions looks evasive, and it forces us to choose between your word and our memory. Only the mod that removed you can reinstate you.

* Ask once.
* Ask nicely.",7,1.0,16,WizKvothe,2024-02-14 00:48:09,1aqgnxa
needadvice,How can I get my grandma to eat more? ,"My grandma was in the hospital about a month ago due to a pericardial effusion. She lives in Mexico and I live in the U.S. so I don’t know about everything that went on while she was there. I’ve been staying with and helping care for her for the past month.  

My grandma told me they had her on a liquid diet for the 3 days she was in the hospital and that she hasn’t had an appetite ever since. My grandpa passed away from a heart attack about a week before she was hospitalized. So she’s definitely severely depressed as she’s stopped doing nearly everything she enjoyed. 

She has a lot of other health problems, but she’s always had a good appetite. She complains about feeling nauseous often and when we went to see her doctor he explained to her that a big part of it is because she’s taking a lot of meds, but not eating enough, other than that he wasn’t very helpful, because he said to try not to push her to eat more than she’s willing to, but I’m very concerned. 

The only things she’s been eating are a couple cookies with coffee (I found her a chicory root blend that has no caffeine and she really liked it) in the morning with her pills. Some fruit, a scrambled egg or an Ensure around noon, she doesn’t have dinner often but when she does, she’ll ask for a fruit smoothie and she’ll drink a very small amount. She won’t eat anything else no matter what we offer her. 

I just ordered her an unflavored plant based protein powder and I’m gonna try to put it in a smoothie and see if I can get her to just sip on it throughout the day. I can’t think of what more to do right now, so any help/ideas are very much appreciated.",5,0.78,5,ThnksfrthMmrss-,2024-12-01 13:54:18,1h4buod

TrueUnpopularOpinion,IMPORTANT: We Need To Talk About The Content Policy...,"The Reddit Admins have messaged us and have brought it to our attention that several posts in violation of the Content Policy had been either gone unnoticed or were allowed to remain.

In light of this, we are going to be more strict regarding violating content in the future. Furthermore, we have added extra measures to decrease the amount of content that will be allowed to slip through the cracks.

Please understand that all subreddits on Reddit are required to follow these rules in order to be allowed to exist.

* Stating or implying that **certain races or protected groups are genetically or inherently less civilized, less intelligent, more violent, or otherwise inferior as compared to others** (includes mentioning racial crime, intelligence, responsibility, accomplishment, or competency differences without also presenting further context that explains that the differences are not due to inherent or genetic superiority or inferiority)
* **Making any statement or implication that Reddit believes to have the effect of denigrating LGBTQ+ people**, including:
   * Stating or implying that trans (wo)men aren't (wo)men or that people aren't the gender they identify as
   * Criticizing, mocking, disagreeing with, defying, or refusing to abide by people's pronoun requests
   * Stating or implying that gender dysphoria or being LGBTQ+ is a mental illness, a mental disorder, a delusion, not normal, or unnatural
   * Stating or implying that LGBTQ+ enables pedophilia or grooming or that LGBTQ+ individuals are more likely to engage in pedophilia or grooming
   * Stating or implying that LGB should be separate from the T+
   * Stating or implying that gender is binary or that sex is the same as gender
   * Use of the term tr\*nny, including other spellings of this term that sound the same and have the same meaning
* Criticizing, mocking, or expressing contempt towards any protected or vulnerable group based on their identity in a manner that denigrates the group
* **Making negative statements or generalizations about a demographic or protected group** (i.e. ""<People of a certain race> are violent"") or making positive statements or generalizations about a non-protected group in a manner that implicitly or explicitly excludes protected groups or is not meant to apply to other groups (i.e. ""White people are civilized"")
* Advocating for the removal of rights or privileges from a demographic or protected group in a manner that would leave them with less rights or privileges than the general population (unless doing so in a manner that solely advocates for people to be punished for crimes or immoral actions)
* Utilizing slurs in a derogatory manner
* Stating or implying that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or other forms of hate or misgendering are justified, should be acceptable, or aren't hateful
* Arguing that the age of consent should be below 18, or otherwise stating or implying that pedophilia or grooming should be acceptable

TrueUnpopularOpinion,Women need to stop being impregnated by men who were obviously going to make them single moms ,"I posted this somewhere else and got slammed, I can not believe that this is a hot take in 2024. Other women were calling me a pick me for something I wasn't even fully aware unpopular, and it honestly makes me a bit concerned for this generation.

 Yes, it takes two to tango, the important and vital part of that being the word ""two."" 

Highly effective and safe birth control exists in this day and age. Some women willingly sleep with men who are obviously going to make them single moms, and they are likely not the first woman that man did that too. I don't even have children, and I would have seen that coming.

 I've known women like this. Like babe I could have looked at the guy and told you he'd make you a single mom. Literally don't sleep with anyone who tells you that he wants to put a baby in you before even getting to know you.

Obviously, men are responsible for leaving the child, but women need to protect themselves first and foremost and avoid men who were obviously going to make them a baby momma and dip. And yes, oftentimes, it's very obvious.

Edit: I have seemed to enrage all of the moms of boys named Jayden, Hayden, and OK-Den on this post. Pls pipe down, your mart cart is low on battery and doing angry donuts on it while you read this post in the Walmart parking lot might make it die. 

Serious edit: Sex positive feminism, hook up culture and baby mama culture has FAILED women and it shows.",511,0.89,299,waftingnotes,2024-12-02 16:14:23,1h57g5d
TrueUnpopularOpinion,Republicans winning the popular votes proves that the conservative/right wing takes on this sub aren’t that unpopular. ,"Title basically. I’ve seen a lot more political (conservative/rightwing) takes on this sub in the recent years. Maybe it’s just what’s populating/being highlighted on my feed. But either folks like to troll this sub/the general left-leaning people of Reddit and/or there’s a bit of a victim complex that the right feel comfort playing into at this time - “my life is shitty, the country is shit, etc., it must be someone’s fault bc it certainly can’t be my fault",61,0.75,47,GrandmaesterHinkie,2024-12-02 19:31:08,1h5bt3s
