ChangeMyView,Meta: r/changemyview is recruiting new moderators,"It's that time of the year folks. We're looking to expand our team of volunteers that help keep this place running. If you're passionate about changing views through thoughtful discourse, what better way can there be to contribute to that than help to keep a community like this as a smoothly oiled machine? We're not looking for a fixed number of new moderators, generally we like to take things by eye and accept as many new mods as we have good applications. Ideal candidates will have...

* A strong history of good-faith participation on CMV (delta count irrelevent).

* Understanding of our rules and why they're setup the way they are.

Please do note though:

Moderating this subreddit is a significant time commitment (minimum 2-3 hours per week). It's rewarding and in my opinion very worthy work, but please only apply if you are actually ready to participate.

ChangeMyView,CMV: Liberal democracies are decaying into illiberal democracies or democracies in name only,"For a democracy to thrive it needs the following (among others):

* A population that agrees on facts: Therefore, channels of information (e.g., podcasts, social media, and traditional media) need to be able to distribute fair and accurate information to the public.
* A population that is informed of their civic duty and is willing to honor them: This means that political participation should be enabled as much as possible e.g by making voting as easy as possible, but most importantly by making education much more than just preparation for a job, but more about how to function as a participant in a society where democracy is the political system
* A political system that is not corrupted by money and special interests: i.e. shouldn't be allowed to buy votes or pay (donate to) politicians to pass favorable legislation.

Around the world, all of the above points are being undermined for example in the EU one of the vice presidents of the EU parliament was arrested for accepting bribes from Qatar, see here: [https://www.politico.eu/article/mep-kaili-charged-with-corruption-by-belgian-prosecutors-reports/](https://www.politico.eu/article/mep-kaili-charged-with-corruption-by-belgian-prosecutors-reports/)

There are many examples of the lack or deterioration of the above basic requirements in numerous places hence my view is that liberal democracies will eventually only be democracies in name only in the future unless we find a way of fixing the :

* information sources so that people can agree on the facts
* Voting is made easier and people understand their civic duty
* Remove corruption from politics.

Edit:

I would also like to add that this is the key reason for the results in the US, I believe that their democracy has decayed so much as to give outcomes that make no sense given the facts of the contenders. ",279,0.78,146,kindly102,2024-11-30 09:55:33,1h3fhh0
ChangeMyView,CMV: Most people don't understand the conflict in Syria because it's not a bipolar war,"By most people I'm referring to the understanding of the conflict in the global scope. Because of the recent events in Ukraine and Israel, a lot of people see the world as a bipolar system now (the United States and NATO versus Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea). In some ways, that is a correct interpretation. Ukraine is the US/NATO and it's allies supporting Ukraine against Russia which is being supported by North Korea and Iran. Israel being supported by the US/NATO against Hamas and Hezbollah, proxies of Iran and allies of Russia. However Syria is not that simple.

At first glance, most people think it's the Russia/Iran backed Assad regime against the US/NATO backed rebels, part of this is true. Assad is indeed a close ally of Russia and Iran, but the rebel situation is much more complicated. Mainly there's the SNA and the SDF, the SNA is a decentralized coalition of different rebel groups which range from fairly moderate to literally Al Qaeda, and the SDF is essentially a Kurdish force in the northeast. Both sides have received some support from the US/NATO in the past, but don't get much anymore. When Trump backed out of Syria in 2019, Turkey and the SNA took control of SDF occupied territory, but the SDF then received help from Assad's government. Turkey is a NATO member of course but the Kurdish SDF was a key NATO ally in defeating ISIS, a group that is obviously not well liked in the West but also still fighting Assad's regime. 

That was a very condensed summary of the Syria conflict, but it illustrates the point kind of, people saying ""the rebels must be supported by Israel or the US because they might soon topple Russia and Iran's allied government"" are somewhat misguided, because although that would make sense in a bipolar system, Syria is not a bipolar conflict. Even though this is largely happening because Hezbollah and Russia (Assad's key allies) are dealing with other conflicts, it doesn't mean that the mostly Islamic fundamentalist rebels taking control of Syria is in the interest of the US, NATO, or Israel, even though those rebels are directly supported by a NATO member, Turkey. 

TL;DR, the conflict in Syria has too many competing groups for it to fit in the bipolar cold war net that Ukraine and Israel are already in, so this has led to a lot of people online making a lot of misinformed commentary about the conflict.

ChangeMyView,CMV: It becomes easier to change someone's mind if you use things that they like ,"It's my first time posting here, so don't be mean please, I genuenely want to hear a different perspective to my current belief 

But anyway: let's say hypothetically that you have someone who thinks women are all inferior. This guy really dislikes women. Let's call him Joe.

The worst thing you can do, is send a woman to talk to Joe. Joe will not listen, and he will be very annoyed.

But If you send a man that Joe deeply admires, Joe will listen to that person. And slowly, Joe will be a little bit more open to accept women, because you used something that he likes.

You know, for example when children hate broccoli, but eat it when it's mixed with cheese or something they like.

Sure, Joe may never respect women regardless of anyone's effort. Joe might just be like that forever.

It is not our duty to change his mind, but... It would make It easier? What do you think?

My personal experience: there was a really racist classmate during my time in highschool. Terrible dude. But he really liked the history teacher, and the teacher was always talking about respecting others regardless of skin color. Nowadays, this dude is an adult and is pretty much normal and has apologized for his past.

Another thing: the sandwhich method. people use It all the time. Compliment, criticize, compliment. That way, people are more inclined to agree with you, because you stroked their ego a bit, while also making them grow as a person.

self,I’m a millionaire and it cost me everything,"37M. Recently hit this milestone after committing myself to my career for the last 15 years. I thought just focus on you, build the future you’re envisioning and the rest will fall into place. Man was I wrong.  The only thing I have is my career. I’ve completely lost myself along the way.

I’m sitting alone in my apartment as the holiday weekend gets under way. Watching the city come to life as I feel I slowly succumb to the opposite force. My friends are all with their families and loved ones, most have small children of their own. Everyone is rightfully consumed with their family and close friends - I just don’t fit-in in most of those settings anymore. 

I could absolutely go out on my own, so I’m not throwing a pity party, it just doesn’t sound appealing to me. 

I’ve given up my hobbies as I never had time for them the last decade, or they no longer interest me. I am unable to find love - some blame is certainly my own in this category but still feels like it’s been a gauntlet. And now most of the available women my age have baggage, kids, etc. Not exactly exciting. 

My friends who I grew up with look at me differently now that I’m successful. There is resentment. I went to intense graduate school and post-grad training during my twenties and  early thirties, I grew apart from and lost touch with many good friends.

I used to be incredibly extroverted and could talk to a wall. Now, not only does small talk and interacting with people seem pointless, I’ve realized I can barely keep a conversation anymore. Interaction with people is a task now, and usually a disappointing or at best unremarkable occurrence in my day. 

I’m a shell of my former self. I don’t have anything to offer anyone other than money. And that’s a worse feeling than having no money, which I’ve also experienced. 

In my tireless journey for success, I lost my humanity and there is no worse poverty to experience than that of connection. 

I hope this finds you well, and I implore you to nurture your connections. Love your family and spouse. Be present with the ones that matter. Lean into your friendships. There is no higher calling as a human than to brighten the world of those you love. That’s real wealth. 

In a world that’s obsessed with status and appearance, achievement and comparison, chasing these vague axioms will lead to a life of emptiness and regret. Be thankful for what you have and for those you love.  It’s the only currency that matters. 



Edit: the intent behind writing this was a cautionary tale to the young professionals and young adults, caution that trying to fulfill yourself and find meaning in life through accomplishment and finances alone will not suffice. To cherish the friends and family you’ve got if you’re lucky enough to have them. Many young people driven to achieve are running from something in their past, I was. it isn’t a valid coping mechanism, and I’m humbly realizing that now. 

I also want to recognize the spectrum on which suffering occurs. I assure you I am aware of how my situation doesn’t hold a candle to most of human suffering. I’m not looking for pity and I appreciate the interaction with this post, even the negative comments have value to me. Be well, all. ",19177,0.8,5930,deebmaster,2024-11-29 21:25:12,1h33ffu

This means OPs cannot hint at or ask for money, and community members cannot offer money or food.

There are many signs of a scammer. They will present a financially desperate situation often with a highly emotional component. They are likely to mention payment services.

personalfinance,Real estate & inheritance: My sister proposed an option that I don’t feel is fair.,"Hello personalfinance - I hope this is the right sub and if anyone has a suggestion for somewhere I should cross post, I am open to that.

I will try to keep this as brief as I can - I don’t think my sisters use Reddit much, and the details seem very specific to me, but I’m going to try to use broader terms.

The situation:
My mother passed earlier this year and left her condo to myself and my 2 sisters, E & M. For what it is worth, E & M are both married with children, I am neither married nor have children. The condo is completely paid off so there is property taxes, insurance, HOA fee, and general utilities to pay for - but no mortgage.

We’re ready to start talking about what to do with the condo. Myself and E have been open to keeping the condo but we know M has no interest in being involved. So, we planned to offer to buy her out.

I initially thought the easiest way to do this would be E and I equally splitting M’s portion 50/50, making us both equal 50/50 owners in the condo. I would then maintain living in the condo, paying for all utilities and whatever amount of the HOA, taxes, and insurance we deemed agreeable. We hadn’t discussed this specifics yet but I would imagine it would have been half and half or me paying slightly more since I would actually be residing in the home and they simply own equity in it.

E has informed me that in order for her (and her husband) to afford buying half of M’s share, they would have to take out a loan. This would throw off their debt/income ratio since if they wanted to take out any further loans for the other properties they own/investments they have, they wouldn’t be able to leverage on the debt of the condo since it is tied up with me as a co-owner.

Her offer:
E & husband take out a loan to fully buy out M’s share. Letting me live in the condo “rent free” to pay nothing but utilities for, say, 5 years. After the 5 years my equity in the condo becomes theirs and they have full ownership over the condo.

Say the condo is worth $300k. That means my share is $100k. In 5 years I would be “giving up” approx. $1666/mo in this “rent free” scenario. It’s not rent free, my rent is paying off my share in the equity, no?

I’m wondering if I have an accurate understanding of how this is working out. My sister is telling me this is a great opportunity for me to live “rent free” while I figure out my next steps over the next couple of years. I see it as an insult that she is slowly charging me $1666/mo over 5 years for me to leave with zero equity in something I currently have equity in.

Please someone explain to me if I am not viewing this accurately. I am admittedly not very educated in these matters and get easily confused & frustrated by major financial things. Her husband is really smart in real estate matters so I feel at a huge disadvantage. I don’t believe my sister or her husband would purposely use this advantage over me in an insidious way, but I do believe they will choose to make the best financial decision for their family, even if it doesn’t work out so great for me. I feel like she is trying to dress it up and make it sound good for me, but right now it’s feeling gross and unfair.

In case it matters - she did say I could rent a room out and keep all of the income from that to save up over the 5 years so maybe I don’t leave with equity in the home but I could leave with a sizable down payment for something else. - this is something I was open to in my initial idea, to help us both out by paying for stuff the condo needs but I didn’t want it to be something I HAD to do in order for me to leave this condo with money that I feel I’m already entitled to (the equity)

TLDR; My sister (E) and I are trying to come up with an agreeable way to buy our 3rd sister (M) out of equity in the condo our Mom left us when she passed. E says my initial idea doesn’t work for her family financially, but I feel like her option is insulting and unfair to me in the long run. 

Neither E or I are really on speaking terms with M currently and E is usually the one I turn to for support. I feel really isolated in this matter and like I don’t have anyone unbiased or on my side knowledgeable to turn to. Even if you have a suggestion on the type of person I should seek advice from in the real world, that would be helpful. A banker? A financial advisor? A real estate attorney? I have no idea…

Thank you anyone who takes the time to read this and weigh in.

Edit: Thank you for everyone’s input so far. All of it has been really helpful in reaffirming some of my understanding and opening my eyes to others. For those of you who are criticizing me for my 50/50 option, I believe I mentioned above that we hadn’t discussed the details of how that would work out and I gave some examples of how it may, admitting in this post that I am not super educated in these matters. So the criticism is unappreciated and more constructive suggestions would be helpful. 
If we are 50/50 owners and I pay the full expenses for upkeep of the house: all utilities, HOA, Taxes & insurance, is that not enough? I would additionally have to pay my sister 50% of the market rent value of the home? Because that’s what she would be “missing out” on making if she were to own it outright and be renting it out? This doesn’t really make sense to me either…",241,0.82,294,Curiously_Traveling,2024-11-30 17:26:54,1h3pd9k

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

AskScience,Why are there lights that can be seen only with the corner of your eye?,"At night, when everything is dark, I often notice that some lights from outside the door can be seen only when i'm not looking. Another example is the switched off neon light, completely off when looking directly, can see a pale light with the corner of the eye.",1023,0.92,78,Obsisama,2024-11-29 19:09:47,1h30xyb
AskScience,How did hereditary diseases like Huntington‘s not die out due to the disadvantages they yield to a family?,"I understand that symptoms of such diseases may only show up after the people have already reproduced, so there might be not enough evolutionary pressure on the single individual. But I thought that humans also owe a lot of their early success to the cooperation in small groups/family structures, and this then yielded to adaptations like grandparents living longer to care for grandkids etc.

So if you have a group of hunter-gatherers where some family have eg huntingtons, or even some small village of farmers, shouldn’t they be at a huge disadvantage? And continuously so for all generations? How did such diseases survive still?",409,0.84,124,jsamke,2024-11-29 03:20:54,1h2i0tv
AskScience,What units are used when measuring carbon-14 in an artifact?,"
I'm studying radiocarbon dating and calculating an artifact's age using the radioactive decay formula.

While going through some examples, I saw one that mentions, ""An artifact is found with 40% of its original carbon-14 remaining. How old is the artifact?"" I understand the concept, but I’m a bit confused about how they determine the percentage, and what units are used to measure the amount of carbon-14.

Can anyone explain how the percentage is calculated and what the unit of measurement for carbon-14 here?",17,0.77,5,oalvtu,2024-11-29 16:59:39,1h2y9yl

Writing,What is your no.1 writing tip?,"I want to write a book, I really, really do, but I never manage to finish ANYTHING. I have piles of storys, some have a few chapters, but never finished. 

My problem is that, when I come back to my text, I cringe and think it‘s super duper bad, that‘s why I drop it. 

So that‘s why I wanna ask, what‘s your no.1 tip generally and to my situation ? Thanks a lot :D

Advice,Do I tell my wife the truth after 11 years? ,"When we first started dating, my girlfriend asked me what my favorite meal was so she could cook it for me for our one month anniversary. We were 16, and I told her my favorite meal was Chicken Parmesan. She cooked it for me from scratch, and it was delicious. However, I realized that what I meant to say was Chicken Alfredo. I felt bad that she went out of her way to cook what she thought was my favorite meal, so I didn’t correct her- or myself. 
 
Fast forward to now. We’ve been together for 11 years, we’ve been married for 2 years and once a month or so she still makes chicken parm for me because she thinks it’s my favorite. It’s good, but it’s really just not my favorite. At this point, it’s way too late to tell her the truth, right? ",431,0.94,170,Weird-Earth-,2024-12-01 01:11:06,1h3xrpq
Advice,Do we tell my grandpa who is in hospice that his best friend has died by suicide? ,"Hello, forgive me, this is my first post so I hope I came to the right place. 

My grandpa is 81 years old and has cancer that's spreading through his body. He, very suddenly,  has been unable to breath or move the past few weeks and is currently in an at-home hospice situation. He also often has confusion spells where he doesnt know where he is or who's he's with. 

He has a younger best friend that have done everything together. They worked together, went fishing, boating, hunting, you name it. My grandpa considered him a son. While my grandpa has been going through all this, his best friend has been visiting every other day or so to keep my grandpa company. He was an incredible man.

With my Gramps confusion increasing, apparently his friend came to visit and he didn't recognize him at first which broke his heart, understandably so. On top of that, I guess he went home that night and have been having trouble with his relationship at home. He got into a big argument with his wife and left the house. The next morning his wife was notified that he died by suicide that night. 

My family is now divided on whether to tell my grandpa or not. Some say that he deserves to know what happened to his beloved friend, especially because he has been asking where he is at and when he's going to visit. The other half says let him spend what little time he has left with happy memories of his friend, especially since this cancer happened so suddenly and he has been feeling extremely depressed since unable to take care of himself anymore. 

Does anyone have any advice or how we can handle this situation? Thanks for reading. ",561,0.94,309,bahh-like-goat,2024-11-30 20:45:25,1h3ta2u
Advice,Boyfriend showed his dad my nudes and I don’t know how to get over it 20F 26M,"Throwaway because I find this story humiliating.
I'm 20F, and my boyfriend, 26M, and I have been in a long-term relationship for about six months now. Over time, he's gradually been telling his family about me and showing them photos.

Last week, He met up with his dad, and during the visit, my boyfriend was showing him photos of me on his phone.
Unfortunately, while doing this, two nude photos l'd sent my boyfriend were accidentally shown to his dad. Later, my boyfriend told me his dad had made a lot of sexualised comments about me, and my boyfriend found it funny. He even told me that he hinted to his dad that I might be into those comments.

He told me this story afterwards, laughing about it and wanting to see my reaction. I was obviously very uncomfortable, especially with how he handled the situation with his dad. When l asked more about it, my boyfriend said his dad only saw photos for about five seconds before he managed to take his phone back. He claimed it was an accident and that he couldn't stop his dad from seeing them because he had the phone in his hand.

I sent my boyfriend a message explaining how I felt about the situation, saying | felt violated and that my trust had been breached. I didn't blame him for the initial accident of the photos being seen, but the sexualised conversation that followed made me feel really uncomfortable. 

Now don’t know how to get over not getting any apology from him along with him not standing up for me. ",208,0.95,164,ThrowRA1235498,2024-11-30 18:55:57,1h3r7cq

LetsNotMeet,Human Trafficking Facts and Stats,"Hi, everyone. Due to the nature of this subreddit and because it's a hot button topic on social media in general, we receive a *lot* of posts and comments about encounters being possible human trafficking.



Unfortunately, there is a massive amount of misinformation about what human trafficking is and isn't, and the vast majority of these interactions here in this subreddit and elsewhere on social media are not how trafficking typically occurs.



# **What is human trafficking, anyway?**



Human trafficking is the exploitation ([thanks to u/officialfourloko for pointing this out!](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/16t9o8w/human_trafficking_facts_and_stats/k2ub7cp/)) of people through coercion, deception, force and any combination of those three, for sex, labor, or both. Human trafficking DOES NOT usually occur by spotting some girl alone out and about, following her and kidnapping her or ""tagging"" her to kidnap later. For sex trafficking in particular, the people trafficked almost *always* know and often times love or trust the person that trafficked them. 



Human trafficking is, disgustingly, a business, and it'd be bad for business to grab some random girl that might have a rich family to look for her, and to do so in front of witnesses. While there have been a few cases of trafficking that have occurred that way (it's sensational and scary, or we wouldn't know about it), it is by far the exception and not the rule. You are more likely to be trafficked by a romantic partner than anyone else.


# **How it happens**


""The most pervasive myth about human trafficking is that it often involves kidnapping or physically forcing someone into a situation. In reality, most traffickers use psychological means such as, tricking, defrauding, manipulating or threatening victims into providing commercial sex or exploitative labor. Another myth is that traffickers target victims they don't know. Many survivors have been trafficked by romantic partners, including spouses, and by family members, including parents."" - Polaris Project



""Perpetrators of human trafficking span all racial, ethnic, and gender demographics and are as diverse as survivors. Some use their privilege, wealth, and power as a means of control while others experience the same socio-economic oppression as their victims. They include individuals, business owners, members of a gang or network, parents or family members of victims, intimate partners, owners of farms or restaurants, and powerful corporate executives and government representatives."" - Polaris Project


# **Recent Statistics**


Based on data* from the [2021 National Report](https://humantraffickinghotline.org/en/resources/2021-national-report) by The Human Trafficking Hotline:



* **72% of trafficking is for sex**, 10% is for forced labor, 4% is for both sex and labor, with the remaining 14% being for unspecified purposes.



* 62% of sex trafficking victims are adults, **28% are minors**. In some cases, demographic information is not provided to the hotline, which is why the percentage here doesn't add up to 100%.



* 84% of sex trafficking victims are female, 8% are male, with the remaining 8% having another gender identity, defined as someone who identifies as any identity other than cisgender male or female.



In the vast majority of cases (88%), the country of origin of victims was unknown. When the country of origin *was* known, the majority of victims were US citizens. 



*note: this data is all from substantiated tips received by the hotline from January 1, 2021 until December 31, 2021, most of which came from victims themselves.

[Here is a story](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/p1bmel/i_was_a_victim_of_sex_trafficking) from this exact subreddit that we approved with verification that describes OP's experience.



Any misinformation about trafficking in this thread will result in it being locked.  Any off topic comments will be removed.",422,0.98,51,fortunesoulx,2023-09-26 22:37:05,16t9o8w
LetsNotMeet,What Belongs Here,"I'm getting real sick of people getting shitty over their stories being removed, so here's a list of stories that inarguably belong here. If you read this thread and you have a story, compare it to any of these. If it wouldn't fit in with this list of stories, *it does not belong on this subreddit.* Usually if you're not sure if a story belongs here, it doesn't. 


1. [They stalked all the stay at home moms](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/7bhjfl/they_stalked_all_the_stay_at_home_moms) - I don't think I need to explain why this fits. I know there is some skepticism in the comments, but as OP was interactive with them prior to deleting her account (typically creative writing pieces OP doesn't respond to many, if any, comments), I think it's okay to leave up. 

2. [This happened quite a long time ago yet it is never too far from my mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/gi7emq/this_happened_quite_a_long_time_ago_yet_it_is) - this fits because although OP made it out unharmed and nothing really happened, the insistence of ""coming up here"" and the fact the creeper left *surgical shears* where they are not needed pushes this story into ""out of the ordinary"" 

3. [No good deed goes unpunished](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1g3x4f/no_good_deed_goes_unpunished) - Here is an example of a car story that would actually remain up. It takes place almost entirely in the car, but it is not someone just following her, or road raging and she goes home physically unharmed. This would be terrifying to go through. (Side note: this is also one of my favorite stories of all time as I love it when assholes like this get their due comeuppance) 

4. [I was a victim of sex trafficking](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/p1bmel/i_was_a_victim_of_sex_trafficking) - this is a real story about actual human trafficking. If you ""think"" you escaped human trafficking, most likely you didn't. Human trafficking overwhelmingly does not happen the way most people think it does, the reality is truly insidious and horrifying. 

5. [The office in the middle of nowhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1t2uwq/the_office_in_the_middle_of_nowhere) - I don't think I really need to explain this one either, I just wanted an example for the ""found something creepy/bizarre"" category. 


As a reminder, stories posted in this subreddit should have been life threatening (stories 1 and 3), extremely unusual/uncommon (stories 2 and 4) or about a time when you stumbled upon something excessively creepy (story 5). 


# What does not belong here? 

* You *think* you were followed because somebody was acting weird but you didn't interact much, if at all and eventually they either gave up or you lost them with minimal effort on your part (so didn't have to hide/confront them) 

* You can't say for certain what someone's intentions were, you can only guess at what they were doing or planning. 

* Being harassed/stared at/catcalled. I understand how frightening and enraging this is, but if you're a woman and you live in any moderately sized city or larger, you will have experienced this. It's entirely too common to be worthy of a story here. That doesn't change the fact it's threatening, disgusting, disrespectful behavior, but this subreddit is meant to focus on, again, life-threatening encounters.
 * an additional note here: stories containing excessive detail about your personal appearance will be removed, even if they fit the standards for this sub. It's a harmful belief to perpetuate in multiple directions that only conventionally attractive people get creeped on - anyone can be harassed on the street. Oftentimes what you look like has little, if anything to do with it, it's the loser's complete lack of regard and view of you as a person and (and for women, lack of respect for us) that causes them to harass you. If our appearance mattered that much for it, 11/12 year olds that look very much like children to anyone with an ounce of brain matter would not get catcalled. 

* The encounter didn't happen to you, but happened to your mother, sister, father, friend, aunt, etc. 

I reserve the right to edit this post to add/remove stories as I see fit, as well as adjust formatting. I suppose we could use this post as well for any comments/suggestions for the sub, cuz why not.

Edit: if you're just gonna bitch that this sub is tOo StRiCt you're wasting your time. Nothing in that regard will be changing.",202,0.99,31,fortunesoulx,2024-02-20 08:29:14,1aviy1c
LetsNotMeet,My hellish neighbours who ruined a year of my life. ,"No one believes me (f25) when I tell people about what I went through last year with my hellish neighbours. 

I had a baby at an inopportune time and me and my partner, who I'll call, Gavin (M30), hurried to buy a house and get everything sorted. We found an inexpensive upstairs flat (if your British you'll know exactly what kind, an upstairs council four-in-a-block).

Upon moving in, we were confronted by some leftover belongings from the last owners, namely, a cross and a small plastic bottle of holy water (I swear this story is real). I figured the last owners were religious and it was just a little gift. Bit weird, but fine.

First two weeks were relatively uneventful. The downstairs neighbours I figured were on holiday, but about day 15, the music started.

I'm fairly easy when it comes to noise disturbances, takes a lot to bother me. After dinner, a loud rumble engulfed the house, and this insanely creepy choir/violin music filled the air. 

It looped for about seven hours, over and over. In the morning, we popped over and asked the neighbours,  a middle-aged couple, to keep it down late at night, as we had a baby, they agreed, were a bit weird, but only faint alarm bells were ringing at this point.

It goes on, and on. Gavin worked nightshifts so it was just me in the house with the baby most nights and I was too scared to confront them. I can honestly, still hear that song now, as I write this from a nice toasty, noiseless home. 

It kept getting worse, and coupled with that we began hearing odd groaning. We assumed they were a little, alternative in their private time. At this point, I joked that they were in a satanic cult (spoiler alert: bad jokes often end up being true).

Then one morning, I woke up to loud screaming. The wife was out, as her motorbike was gone and I hadn't heard her for weeks. I can only vaguely recall it, and for a while I thought I was merely dreaming it. It was loud, visceral and seemed to tear at the air and came in concert with the screaming of an angry man. 

When Gavin got in from his nightshift I asked him to help me call the police, as more frightening than the screaming from downstairs, was the silence that had come after. Gavin at this point, decided I had post-partum depression, and rather than call the police, he advised I speak to my health visitor. 

I was depressed at this point, but it wasn't due to my new motherhood, it was the constant creepy music. But then I supposed, perhaps I was going crazy, I started to actually believe they were satanists and that they were doing weird rituals downstairs.

The CIA uses noise to torture people and I was suffering the same. I was on maternity leave, I was in the house most of the day, and I was losing my mind, and now, after the screaming I was terrified. 

A nice old couple lived in the block opposite, and when they asked the couple rather firmly to keep it down, they were threatened with bodily harm. 

It went on for months. Gavin and I decided to work toward selling and we made the decision to avoid police reports, as these would have to be declared when selling. 

As months pulled by, they just kept getting weirder. There were pumpkins in their garden filled with offal from the butcher, they just threw entire pies in their yard, and were always fighting, breaking things and from the sounds of it, throwing furniture. 

Gavin went down one night after they started playing weird throat singing that was particularly loud, and this time, for some reason, the gentleman took him inside of their house to explain why the music had to be so loud. 

His wife, Ursula we'll call her, ran a spiritual business and summoned demons. The music was part of the ritual. They belonged to an organization called the Order of the Nine Angles, which upon my research is a neo-nazi satanic cult reasonably popular in the UK. 

She took clients (explains the groaning) and made money from it. Gavin describes their house as being littered in satanic stuff, pentagrams, ceremonial daggers, candles, pitch black. 

Low and behold, the throat singing continued. At this point, we're terrified, so we gather our things and seek refuge in my MIL's house and hasten our efforts to sell. Gavin likes to joke, that worse than seeing all of the demon stuff, was realizing that I had been right all along and not paranoid.

At some point, the downstairs neighbour gets arrested for having a trunkfull of machetes, couple this with the fact the O9A are currently being considered as a terrorist organisation, it's downright terrifying. 

We manage to sell the place, and I just feel awful. For two reasons, someone else will have to suffer like me, and I've willfully hid the bonkers neighbours, and secondly, I keep thinking of that screaming... that awful, gutteral scream, and the cold quiet that came after.

I also keep thinking about why they took Gavin into the house. He emphasIzes that he told them I was waiting upstairs, was this what dissuaded them from doing something else? That I was listening with a phone easy to grab? Or did they simply mean to threaten him with the daggers on their walls? 

I left the crucifix and the holy water in a drawer. It was all I could do. 

So, creepy neo-nazi satanic neighbours, let's not meet again. ",59,0.87,7,CelebrationCandid363,2024-11-30 14:36:46,1h3lqno
LetsNotMeet,"He Lived in My House...
","Hi, this is the first time I’m sharing something here, so I hope my story will be easy to understand (by the way, this isn’t my account).

For privacy reasons, I won’t give my name or age.

For a bit of context, this happened about two years ago, a few weeks after my little brother was born. Ever since we moved into this house, there’s been this small room in the basement that’s always locked. To show you how little anyone uses it, I don’t even know what’s in there, but I’ve always assumed it’s just utility stuff like meters or something. The room is really tiny, barely big enough to lie down in.

Now, let’s get into it. My parents went away for a weekend together, leaving me, my older sister, and my baby brother (who was just a few weeks old at the time) at home. My parents trusted us to take care of ourselves since they’d done this before. Anyway, that night my sister went out with friends and wasn’t planning to come back until 4 or 5 in the morning. I watched a good movie and, since it was already getting late, I decided to put my little brother to bed in his room upstairs. I did that and came back down to watch another movie, but I ended up falling asleep.

About two or three hours later, around midnight, I woke up to these strange noises coming from upstairs. At first, I thought it was just the neighbors since they can be pretty loud and the walls are thin. But then I looked at the time and realized it was too late for them to still be awake, let alone making that kind of noise. So, I got closer to the stairs to investigate, and just as I was about to go up the first step, I heard the sound of something metal falling on the ground. Guess what? It was the key to the small room in the basement.

I immediately grabbed my phone, and instead of calling the police, I texted my friends to tell them what was happening. One of my friends had the brilliant idea of calling the police for me. Suddenly, I heard the bathroom door slam shut. I knew it was that door because it makes a very specific creaking noise when it closes. I remembered my brother was sleeping upstairs, so I carefully went up to check if he was okay. Thankfully, he was fine.

Still not fully grasping how much danger I was in, I went to the bathroom door. Since it opens inward, I decided to violently push it open—and I heard a man scream. I immediately shut the door and held it closed to keep him from getting out. He broke the window, and outside the bathroom, there’s this sort of balcony—not a proper one, but you get the idea—that connects to the balconies of the neighboring houses, which are all really close together. He used that to escape.

I grabbed my brother in my arms, ran to the kitchen, and noticed that one of the knives was missing from the knife block. I picked up another knife and crouched in a corner of the living room, crying like never before. The police arrived, and I opened the door for them.

When they searched the house, they confirmed that the bathroom window was broken, and I had hit the guy so hard that there was blood on the floor. But the most shocking and traumatizing part was what they found in that small basement room. There were blankets and cans of food. They concluded that he had been living there for several days...

That’s it. I hesitated a lot before posting this because it really affected me, and I’m sorry if the story isn’t super clear—some of the details are still jumbled in my head. Anyway, I hope you found it interesting!",48,0.98,4,david_mstk,2024-11-30 10:34:47,1h3gd3c
SelfImprovement,"For me, there is only one way to overcome depression","Hi everyone, firstly I would like to say that I am happy and proud that you are following this subreddit because you are actively trying to improve your life and most importantly yourself.

This shit is not easy. Whether you’re doing fine but just want to make small improvements or you feel like you’ve hit rock bottom. It is very difficult honestly but I commend all of us for trying and seeking out help, motivation, joy, and a better life. Joy should be normal. We do not have to hold on to bitter feelings, self hated, negativity, and pain to “glow up” 

With this being said, the only thing that is getting me out of an over one year hellacious depression is putting love out into this world. This is extremely difficult for me because after all the hell I have been through even though I thought it would never happen to me, I became bitter. I became a person who couldn’t feel joy. I became numb. I couldn’t even cry. I couldn’t even smile. Honestly it felt like strong demons were constantly trying to steal my life force and the beauty of life from me. 

But I want you to know how I feel right now. If I and you continue to hype up our “weaknesses”, hate our “faults”, and magnify issues to the point we think the whole world is against us; we will not get to experience what we all long for. And that is: relief, gratitude, being proud of ourselves, feeling love, giving love and many other things that life has to offer. 

Let me tell you, both my parents were alcoholics and drugs addicts and my mother drank while I was in womb, I was neglected and abused as a child with the most painful wounds being the psychological torture, I have experienced SA, I have experienced being degraded, mistreated, lied to, cheated on, scammed, thrown away and many other things. 

However I have also experienced what it’s like to experience success, love, care, feeling proud of my accomplishments etc etc. But for over a year now I have mainly felt resentment, nostalgia of the good days, and toxicity. But then I realized that nothing is changing because I am only adding fuel to the fire of the hell I’ve put myself through. 

I can’t control anyone else. I can’t control the state I live in (FL) (PS: I don’t recommend it, find you a montainy more beautiful state if you can), I can’t control random bumps,blockades, or obstacles in the road. However, I can prepare myself to put my joy as the top priority. I can control not being like the people that hurt me. I can control putting the work in to seize my day. And you can too. 

Don’t ever let anyone steal your joy you hear me? Not even yourself. If human beings have made it this far with many catastrophes, that should let you know that you can as far as the dreams you have and then even further. You wouldn’t believe the opportunities that come from letting this bitterness go. Us letting the pain poison us is not doing anything to the ones who made us suffer. Most people that hurt people just don’t give a fuck. 

I think the most powerful tool is leading by example in terms of being the person you would admire. Because most of the time, the abusers feel real embarrassed once they see they didn’t convert you into being like them. And even if you bettering yourself doesn’t make them feel anything, the people and opportunities that come from being the love you put out will be 1000000x more fulfilling.

With all the negative shit we see on social media, I know it’s hard to believe there is a bright side. But the truth is, do whatever you can to see it. Even if it’s just a sliver. We have to allow healing and forgiveness so we can experience the opposite of what most of us have experienced. Which is a lot of bullshit. The world isn’t over and neither is our lives. 

Apologize to yourself and if you want, apologize to others or do so in your head if they have you blocked. 

I hope that my post has given you hope from the hope I feel from the power of letting go from resentment. I truly believe that a lot of people who read this lives will be changed. Not because of me nor for me but because you the reader have decided  enough is enough. I send peace and love vibes to you guys. Drop a comment sharing your stories and if this helped you in any way.",108,0.98,6,anaglizzy,2024-11-30 19:48:10,1h3s7td
SelfImprovement,I care too much about how people perceive me. ,"I feel small compared to others, and I’m anxious around other people. 

I’m scared I’m going to say something stupid, which will make others perceive me worse. 

I feel that if I stay more quiet, I won’t say something stupid. 

I’m always thinking about my posture, tone, and eye contact around people.

I always feel like everyone is watching me, waiting for me to mess up. 

I feel like the spotlight is on me all the time when I’m out in public and it stresses me out.

I feel that people can feel my anxiety. 

I want to be more confident and think less about how I think other people think of me, but I don’t know how to turn it off. 

Why do I care about all this? Why does all of this matter to me so much? Why can’t I just be comfortable with myself and not worry about how others perceive me?

SelfImprovement,I want to be happy being alone,"Slightly depressing post, but feeling somewhat hopeless.

I have slowly come to the realisation that we live in a world in which not everyone is paired up. For some, such as myself, it isn't possible. 

My challenge is I crave connection. I have friends, but they have their own lives and families. I cannot rely on them every time I feel lonely because that wouldn't be fair and I believe eventually they will 'drop' me because I do not fit their lifestyles and will just be the sad third wheel.

How can I become happy with my own company?
How can I go to gigs/new countries without this overwhelming sense of loneliness?
How do I plan for a future where it is just me?

Appreciate any guidance I can get!",81,0.96,45,Mr-Silly-Bear,2024-11-30 15:44:56,1h3n7hi
SelfImprovement,This changed my life — 9 hrs/day to 2 hrs/day doom scrolling,"I'm embarrassed to admit it… but I've been averaging 9 hours a day on my phone for a while (mostly Reels)… I got an iPhone when I was a sophomore in high school, and I think I've been addicted ever since...

Honestly it didn't even feel like that much. It just kind of happens…

* Wake up: scroll (1+ hr)
* Eat breakfast/lunch: on my phone (1+ mins)
* Evening: watch TV while on my phone (3 hrs)
* Lay down for bed: scroll (1+ hrs)
* Wake up in middle of night: scroll (1+ hrs)
* Plus using throughout the day (2 hrs)

I got serious about cutting back, and it's changed my life... it's been reminding me of simpler times growing up... I don't think I've felt this much peace of mind since before I had a phone

If you are anything like me, all I can say is... I wish I did it earlier

Here are the three things I changed:

* **1) Turn on grayscale:** It's annoying… but it seriously works. Makes your phone way less addicting and boring to use. I set up an automated schedule using my phone settings.
* **2) Set hard app limits:** After one hour of social media, I can't open it no matter what. I also keep social completely locked from 7am-7pm.
* **3) Find better replacements:** This was a important one. Replace scrolling with simple things you'd rather do (for me: read, play guitar, call friends, etc). Even just ""watching TV"" without double screening is a better replacement for me... I can actually enjoy the show and get some real relaxation from it.

**Bonus:** how to set an automatic schedule for grayscale:

* Schedule grayscale to kick in certain times of day (on iOS)...
   * Open the native **Shortcuts** app
   * Go to **Automation** and tap **+** in the top right
   * Select **Time of Day** → **Sunset**, tap **Next**.
   * Tap **Add Action (or ""New Automation"")**
   * Search for **Set Color Filters** → Select it
   * Confirm **Color Filters On**, then tap **Next**
   * Toggle off **Ask Before Running** → Confirm **Don't Ask** → Tap **Done**.
   * Set automation to ""**Run Automatically**"" so you don't have to approve it each time
   * (then repeat a schedule to turn it off each morning at sunrise)",190,0.96,12,notta-musician,2024-11-30 10:46:35,1h3gmn2
DecidingToBeBetter,Revamped Flair System: Guide on Using the New Post Flairs,"Hello everyone! 

After months of observing how the flair system was being used, I noticed that many people were confused about which flair to use, and this often led to posts being flaired incorrectly. To make things easier for everyone and reduce confusion, I have revamped the flair system.

I have added new flairs and removed older ones to keep the posts more organized on the subreddit. These changes are designed to make it easier for everyone to find relevant posts and contribute in a more structured manner. 

Whether you are a long term member or new to this subreddit, please take a moment to check out this guide and familiarize yourself with the updated flairs! 

# 1- [Seeking Advice]

**Use this flair when you are looking for advice, guidance, or support** **in an area you are trying to get better at.**

If you're dealing with a specific challenge and need input, this is the flair to use.

**Examples**:

* “How do I overcome procrastination?”
* “I’m struggling to control my emotions, any advice?”

# 2- [Sharing Helpful Tips]

**Use this flair to offer tips, strategies, or advice that has worked for you.**

If you have found something that helped you on your journey to be better and think it could benefit others, use this flair.

**Examples**:

* “Things I did that improved my mental health.”
* “Tips on setting boundaries with family and friends.”

# 3- [Discussion]

**Use this flair for open-ended discussions or seeking general feedback from the community on a particular topic.**

If your post encourages others to share their thoughts, engage in conversation, or debate different perspectives, this is the flair to use. Asking for book/podcast/tools recommendations also falls under this flair.

**Examples:**

* “How do you stay motivated during difficult times?”
* “Does anyone else feel overwhelmed by the pressure to constantly improve themselves?”
* “What are some books or podcasts that helped you on your self-improvement journey?”

# 4- [Progress Update]

**Use this flair when you want to share a specific update or milestone about a goal you are currently working on.**

Whether it's a small win or recent improvement, this flair highlights the progress you have made on your self-improvement journey.

**Examples:**

* “I worked out 3 times this week and I’m proud of myself!”
* “I managed to cut down my screen time from 8 hours a day to 5 hours a day.”

# 5- [Journey]

**Use this flair to share a broader reflection on your self-improvement journey as a whole.**

This is less about a specific goal or milestone and more about your long-term experiences, insights, challenges, and growth over time.

**Examples:**

* “Over the past year, I’ve been meditating every day. Here’s how it’s changed my life.”
* “How learning to say ‘no’ as a chronic people pleaser has changed my life.""

# 6- [Success Story]

**Use this flair when you have reached a significant milestone or successfully completed a goal.**

This is about celebrating your achievements with the community so we can celebrate with you.

**Examples:**

* “After 6 months of hard work, I finally managed to quit smoking.”
* “I’ve been working on overcoming my self-criticism and low self-esteem for years. Today, I looked in the mirror and didn’t berate myself. Instead, I told myself I was beautiful.”

# 7- [Spreading Positivity]

**Use this flair for motivational posts, words of encouragement, or anything that aims to uplift the community.**

This is the flair to use when you want to share positive energy with the community and let them know they are supported.

**Examples**:

* “Healing is not linear. Progress takes time, and you are doing a great job.”
* “Read this if you are having a bad day.”

**This marks the end of the guide. I will continue to update this post if there are any changes.**

If you have any feedback or ideas on how we can improve the flair system even further, please feel free to share them in the comments below. Your input is important and helps make the community better for everyone!",5,0.86,1,whereverthelightis,2024-11-16 16:42:38,1gsz1s8

DecidingToBeBetter,How do I stop seeking male validation?,"I don’t want a boyfriend and nothing romantic. I randomly had “lustful” thoughts of an ex-guy friend and have been posting on my Snapchat private stories that only he could see of me and how life is going but haven’t heard from him. It throws me off. It’s weird because I don’t love him, but I want his attention for some strange reason.

DecidingToBeBetter,How to stop feeling isolated & alienated ,"So, I am very friendly and know a bunch of people at my uni, I eat lunch with them and we joke about things and laugh but I don't really share much about me or consider them my real friends, sometimes I feel like they perceive me as a secondary character in their lives, and lately I've been wanting to have a group of friends, not just individual friends I spend time with, but a group to hangout, people to have and celebrate my birthday with. 

  
I know I've been kind of feeling like this my whole life, like the joker friend that is there to have a good time and have fun with them, but not to really form a more meaningful relationship. Ever since I was a child I saw other people and their lives and I felt very alienated because mine was so different and I felt like I couldn't share/tell anything about it and they wouldn't relate to it. There was a mix of physical and psychological abuse when I was younger (don't worry, I don't live with those people anymore) that led me to not share and even feel ashamed at the idea of people knowing about my context, family, anything kinda private really. Sharing about things that have more to do with me and my life makes me feel ashamed and like I did something wrong, I get why people would see me more as a stranger than a friend then, and why I feel both alienated and isolated, but it feels so unnatural to share stuff, it's like I don't know how to do it, I don't know who are the people that are appropiate to tell them stuff because they are closer or something, and when is the right time socially to do so either.

AskHistorians,"Short Answers to Simple Questions | November 27, 2024","[Previous weeks!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)

**Please Be Aware**: We expect everyone to read the rules and guidelines of this thread. Mods *will* remove questions which we deem to be too involved for the theme in place here. We *will* remove answers which don't include a source. These removals will be without notice. Please follow the rules.

Some questions people have just don't require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.

Here are the ground rules:

* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right.
* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.
* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.
* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don't realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.
* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.
* Academic secondary sources are preferred. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the 'Oxford Companion' series, or a reference work from an academic press).
* The *only* rule being relaxed here is with regard to depth, insofar as the anticipated questions are ones which do not require it. All other rules of the subreddit are in force.",7,0.83,41,AutoModerator,2024-11-27 11:00:33,1h192cj

AskHistorians,What caused the “frenzied killing” that took place during the Rwandan Genocide?,"I feel like I have a good grasp on the history leading up to the genocide, including the Tutsi / Hutu hierarchy that predated the pseudoscientific eugenics imposed by the Belgians. 

What I have trouble grasping is the absolute; frenzied slaughter that led countrymen to kill fellow countrymen; including neighbours, in laws and friends. Not just killed, but hacked apart with machetes. 

In reading “Shake Hands with the Devil” by Lieutenant Dallaire, and also watching his documentary, he described the killing as a frenzy, that the perpetrators were drunk on violence, showing 0 remorse for a level of violence that cannot be taken much further. Hacking with machetes, rapes while HIV positive, torture etc…

I know these acts are not unique to the Rwandan genocide, but something about the absolute blood lust that over took the nation and led to 1 million dead in such a short time really has me wondering.

Can it be answered by religion, psychology, history, human nature deeply imbedded in us? 

I apologize if I broke any subreddit rules, I did look before posting this, please let me know if have to correct anything.

Thank you in advance to any historians that answer. Although the topic is grim, I feel we do the world a service speaking about it, as still so many don’t even know anything about the horrors that befell Rwanda in 1994 (the year of my birth).

We will ***not*** have any transphobia or TERFs in this sub.

For example, telling someone who brings up in posts about women that they’re not talking about trans women, or that bringing up trans women is derailing, is basically the same thing as saying trans women aren’t included in being women.

nosleep,My mom found some old video tapes,"Not long ago, my mother stumbled upon a forgotten treasure trove of old videotapes, relics from my childhood circa 1990. Her excitement was palpable as she brought them to a photography store, eager to have the man behind the counter “virtualize” them—her words, not mine—and transfer their contents onto a sleek, modern pendrive. It struck me as absurdly poetic: hours of clunky, analog memories distilled into a device small enough to lose between the couch cushions.

The day she retrieved her tiny time capsule, she called me with the enthusiasm of someone unveiling a long-lost artifact. She suggested we meet for tea and watch the tapes together. I hesitated. Nostalgia, for me, has always been a double-edged sword. Old photos, childhood anecdotes—they tend to make me wince more than smile. But her excitement was genuine, almost contagious. So, despite my reluctance, I agreed. If nothing else, it seemed like a small price to pay to make her happy.

When I arrived, she greeted me with a warm smile and a hug, the kind that felt like coming home. The scent of freshly brewed tea wafted through the air as she ushered me inside, handing me a tray of pastries she’d picked up from the bakery. “Set the table,” she said, her voice light and full of purpose, as though this little ritual mattered more than it usually would. I obliged, arranging the sweet treats while she poured tea into delicate cups that had probably seen fewer family gatherings than they deserved.

We sat together, savoring the spread she had so thoughtfully prepared, and the conversation naturally turned to my dad. His new job had taken him north to the United States, a world away. We both admitted we missed him. He’d been traveling back and forth, spending three months abroad at a time, and the distance felt heavier with every trip. Even the phone calls, brief and sporadic as they were, felt more like placeholders than real moments shared.

At some point, I asked if she’d told my sister about the tapes. She shrugged with a nonchalant smile, the kind that only partially hides a deeper thought. “There aren’t many of her,” she admitted softly. “I wanted to show you first, just the two of us.” There was something in her tone—an intimacy, a quiet sense of importance—that made me feel like this moment wasn’t just about the tapes. It was about us.

Before I could finish my second cup of tea, my mother clapped her hands with the eagerness of someone who had waited long enough. “Time to watch the tapes,” she announced, her excitement spilling over. “You can finish your tea on the sofa.” There was no arguing with her, so I followed her lead, carrying my cup as we moved to the living room.

Setting up the TV was straightforward, though she hovered beside me, fussing over the details as if the pendrive held the secrets of the universe. I slid the tiny device into the port and took the remote, scrolling through the files that appeared on the screen. There were seven in total, each unnamed and numbered in the order they had been filmed. No titles, no clues—just raw, unfiltered memories waiting to be unearthed.

We started, naturally, with file number one. My mother settled beside me on the sofa, her eyes bright with anticipation.

The screen flickered to life, revealing nothing but a black void. The display indicated the clip was three minutes long, but there was no image—only darkness. Then came the sound: heavy, uneven breathing, and the faint crunch of footsteps on dry leaves, branches snapping underfoot. It sounded like someone walking through the woods, their breaths growing more labored with each step.

I glanced at my mother. The excitement that had lit up her face only moments ago had vanished, replaced by a puzzled frown. “Skip ahead a bit,” she suggested, her voice uneasy. I obliged, pressing the button to jump forward a few seconds. But nothing changed. The screen remained dark, the footsteps continued, and the breathing grew heavier, almost gasping now. It was then that I realized it wasn’t just breathing—it was a woman. You could hear it in the way the sounds caught and faltered, like someone on the edge of tears.

“Did you record this?” I asked her, my voice low. She shook her head slowly, her lips pressed into a thin line, then raised a finger to her mouth, urging me to stay quiet. Her eyes were fixed on the screen, her expression tense, almost as if she were holding her breath.

And then, just before the clip ended, the sobbing began. It was soft, restrained, like whoever was recording didn’t want to be heard. I could tell they were trying to speak—there were faint, broken attempts at words—but nothing coherent came out, just muffled gasps swallowed by silence. My mother gripped the edge of the sofa, her knuckles white, but she said nothing.

The screen cut abruptly, and for a moment, the room felt impossibly still. Then, as if nothing unusual had happened, a new video began to play: my fourth birthday. The bright, joyful chaos of a child’s party filled the screen, but neither of us moved. We just sat there, caught between confusion and unease, trying to make sense of what we had just witnessed.

When the last video ended, my mom and I sat in silence. The room felt heavy, though neither of us said a word. After a moment, I remembered the tea in my hands and took a sip, only to grimace at its coldness. My mother noticed immediately, her eyes flicking to the cup. “Do you want me to heat that up?” she asked, but before I could answer, she had already taken it from my hands and disappeared into the kitchen.

I followed her, the silence still hanging between us like an unspoken question. Leaning against the doorway, I asked the thing that had been circling in my mind. “What do you think that first video was?”

She paused, glancing at me as she set the cup in the microwave. For a moment, her expression was unreadable, but then she smiled—a light, dismissive smile, as though brushing away a stray thought. “Oh, it was probably some mistake,” she said with a wave of her hand. “The man at the store must’ve put it on the pendrive by accident. I’ll go ask him about it tomorrow.” Her tone was casual, practiced even, but I couldn’t tell if it was meant to reassure me or herself.

The microwave beeped, and she pulled the cup out, cradling it as if the warmth in her hands might soothe her own unease. “What did you think of the other videos?” she asked, her voice softening as she handed me the tea. “You were such a pretty little girl back then. Oh, how I miss those times.”

Her words hung in the air, but my mind lingered on the video, on the sound of that woman’s breaths and sobs. My mom’s attempt to steer the conversation elsewhere didn’t feel wrong, but it didn’t feel right either. I sipped my tea and nodded, letting her nostalgia fill the silence, though the unease from that first video remained, quietly gnawing at the edges of my thoughts.

By the time I left my mother’s house, the sky was fading into dusk, the air carrying the weight of an ending day. Before I stepped out, I asked her if I could take the pendrive with me to show it to my husband. She smiled and handed me a second one. “I had a copy made for you,” she said. “It was always meant to be yours.”

When I arrived home, the house was quiet, still bathed in the soft glow of evening. I set my bag down and went straight to my laptop, eager to revisit the tapes, though the memory of that first video lingered uneasily in my mind. As the laptop hummed to life, I slid the pendrive into its port, expecting nothing more than what I’d already seen. But as the files loaded, something new caught my eye—a second folder, one that hadn’t shown up on the TV. My curiosity piqued, I clicked on it.

Inside were a handful of corrupted documents—files with strange, unreadable names—and a single video. My heart quickened as I hovered over it, the unease from earlier stirring again. I clicked, and the screen opened, dark and familiar. Like the first video from my mother’s house, the image was nothing but blackness, but the sound told a different story. The woman’s sobbing was more frantic now, her breaths harsh and desperate. The cracks of branches beneath her feet came faster, sharper, as if she were running.

Then came the rain—soft at first, then heavier, joined by the low rumble of thunder. The atmosphere thickened, the soundscape alive with tension. And then, out of the void, a flash of light. A bolt of lightning struck a tree, illuminating the screen for a fleeting moment. I froze, my finger hovering over the keyboard. Without thinking, I hit pause.

The stillness that followed was deafening. My eyes stayed fixed on the screen, the ghostly outline of the illuminated tree burned into my vision. For a moment, I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. Something about that single frame felt too real, too deliberate. And for the first time that night, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to keep watching.

I steeled myself and pressed play. The burning tree remained in the frame, its flames casting flickering shadows that gave the scene an eerie semblance of life. The camera swayed erratically, capturing glimpses of the turbulent sky above and the muddy ground below. It felt chaotic, disorienting, like watching through the eyes of someone barely holding on.

Then came the roar—a deep, guttural sound that reverberated through the speakers and into my chest. It wasn’t human, and whatever it was, it drove the woman into a desperate sprint. Her sobs turned to frantic cries, her voice trembling as she murmured something about God under her breath. The words were too soft to catch, but their despair was unmistakable.

A deafening boom rang out, an explosion so jarring that it made me flinch. The woman stumbled, her breathing ragged as the camera tilted violently. And then she fell.

The screen glitched, the image fragmenting into streaks of static, but when it cleared, the camera had landed on the ground, its lens now pointing directly at her. I couldn’t see her face, only the back of her head, her short, brown hair matted with rain and dirt. She crawled toward the camera, her trembling fingers brushing against its edges. Then, just as she reached for it, she whispered something—a single word.

My heart sank like a stone, my chest tightening as if the air had been sucked from the room. A strange weightlessness took over my body, and I became hyperaware of everything around me—the soft hum of my laptop, the ticking of the clock, even the faint rustle of leaves outside the window. But I couldn’t move. My limbs felt disconnected from my will, my mind too consumed by what I had just witnessed.

I couldn’t blink. I couldn’t breathe. I was frozen in that moment, trapped by a fear I didn’t fully understand. It wasn’t just the video—it was the way it had burrowed into my mind, unraveling something deep within me. I wanted to look away, to close the laptop, to do anything to break free from the paralysis that gripped me. But I didn’t. Or perhaps, I didn’t want to. Something about the stillness, the helplessness, kept me tethered to that screen, as if moving would shatter the fragile veil between reality and whatever dark truth I had just glimpsed.

Then, a single thought pierced through the haze of fear and confusion. It cut through the stillness like a blade, sharp and undeniable.

nosleep,"Fuck HIPAA, my new patient is mimicking me and I'm starting to get scared","In 2010, Taos County emergency services responded to a house fire in a small subdivision perched along the edge of one of the area’s canyons.

EMS found the homeowners standing on the precipice of the canyon. One homeowner was in a catatonic state, with such severe burns on his hands that bone was visible.

The other homeowner was hysterical, screaming, “It’s still down there! Kill it! It’s going to come after us!”

With some difficulty, EMS loaded both victims into an ambulance.

Shortly after the vehicle departed, remaining responders observed an individual climbing out of the canyon. 

An individual who was identical to the homeowner with burned hands.

Once spotted, it crawled back into the canyon.

The resulting rescue effort located no signs of human life or remains in the canyon.

This might have been the end if the entity at the center of this incident did not immediately attempt to “move in” to a neighboring house.

The events that followed this relocation attempt were highly unfortunate. In fact, the only benefit was that it drew the attention of the Agency of Helping Hands.

V-Class agent Charles W. successfully apprehended the entity, a feat he credits to his extensive experience with domesticated birds. Charles W. would like to note that his experience with this entity inspired him to pursue a psychiatry degree, which eventually led to the establishment of the agency’s Inmate Therapy Program. 

After taking the entity into custody, the agency learned very quickly that the burned home had been the site of extensive violent phenomena for decades. 

They located the first homeowner, Mrs. Woodard, who brought her widowed daughter and grandson to live with her many years ago. The arrangement ended in tragedy when the child passed after falling into the canyon. Following his death, the mother became markedly unstable and vanished some six months later. The homeowner herself vacated the home following an assault perpetuated by an attacker “pretending to be my daughter.” 

Years later, a couple called Moore purchased the home. Unfortunately, Mr. Moore suffered an aggressive terminal cancer diagnosis during escrow, and passed away three months later. 

The following summer, Mrs. Moore hosted a birthday party for her son. Unfortunately, the party itself was marred by tragedy when a guest vanished. Extensive search efforts were futile.

Two weeks later, the guest reappeared in the basement of the home suffering unspecified catastrophic injuries.

By October of that year, neighbors claimed to regularly see Mr. Moore puttering around the house and watching the neighbors through the windows.

The couple’s adult daughter left home shortly before neighbors began inquiries into the apparent resurrection of Mr. Moore. The son departed shortly after to live with friends. Neither ever returned home.

Mrs. Moore lived in the house until declining health necessitated transfer to a nursing home, but she escaped the facility frequently in order to sneak into her old house. When asked why, she said, “Because my husband is there.”

Despite extensive efforts to rent out the home, the house sat empty for years partly due to Mrs. Moore’s constant break ins, and partly due to its burgeoning reputation as a “haunted house.”

The reputation was not undeserved, as a documented string of disasters befell anyone who stayed in the house for more than a few weeks.

The best-documented of these incidents involves a young man named Adam, whose brother Jason (known to suffer from severe substance abuse disorder) vanished shortly before Adam moved into the home with his mother. According to multiple witnesses, Jason moved in some two weeks later. The situation ended abruptly when Jason attacked their mother for “leaving for a work trip,” causing Adam to retaliate. The injuries inflicted upon Adam necessitated a hospital stay, after which Adam and his mother vacated the house. According to available records, Jason never resurfaced.

After investigating these and many other events,  the agency came full circle to the young homeowners who had been grievously injured during the house fire. 

In 2009, the couple, Kara and Julian, took advantage of the housing crisis to purchase their dream home.

At risk of falling into cliche, the dream became a nightmare.

The situation brought out the worst. Their volatile relationship cratered to new lows. Each accused the other of chaotic, manipulative, coercive, and abusive behavior while denying that they themselves were engaging in such behavior. 

The stress combined with the treatment they inflicted upon each other resulted in the breakdown of their relationship. Kara remained in the home. Julian moved out.

Rather than settle, however, the situation escalated. 

Within two weeks, Julian was accusing Kara of violently stalking him and harassing him with “verbal vomit.”

Kara, in turn, was accusing Julian of violently stalking *her* while engaging in harassment that included a barrage nonsensical verbal abuse.

The situation came to a head one night when Kara — facing down an erratic Julian during yet another violent stalking incident — shot him in self-defense…

Right as a second Julian walked through the front door, ostensibly to confront her for stalking him earlier that day. 

As Kara struggled to process this development, the body she’d just shot shuddered back to life and ran into the basement.

From there, the former couple put their differences aside to address this highly unique challenge.

The details of their actions, while highly interesting, are not relevant to this inmate’s file.

After gathering the testimony of Kara, Julian, and other former occupants, the agency concluded that it was dealing with an entity that could change its form at will.

In other words, they were dealing with a mimic.

Years of extensive work with this inmate have established the following:

Prior to capture, the inmate’s primary mode of communication was complex mimicry, in which the entity — similarly to birds such as corvids and hook bills — overheard human speech while observing human behavior, and assigned their own meanings to the words, phrases, and combinations thereof that it observed.

Sometimes the meanings assigned by the inmate were correct. Sometimes, they were not. Most often, these meanings occupied a liminal linguistic space where a listener could generally interpret the inmate’s speech if the listener was reasonably familiar with the inmate’s history.

As a result of this language barrier, the inmate’s extensive dealings with the human beings are best described as a terrifying comedy of errors.

Objectively, the inmate’s actions most closely resembled that of a possessive, obsessive stalker. As with many stalkers, the inmate’s motivation was not fundamentally malicious. 

As with any stalker, however, the motivation did not mitigate the disastrous impact of its actions.

Once the language barrier was addressed, the inmate proved eager to “learn how to behave.” This cooperativeness, in combination with their magnificent talents (and the largely unlimited application thereof), resulted in a reclassification of the inmate to Thiessi-Class.

While still in a highly prolonged training program, the inmate is currently assigned as a field partner to V-Class agent Gabriella W. and is, by all accounts, thriving.

 The inmate’s preferred name is Love. 

When not in active transformation, Love takes the form of a human being with a very pale, smooth complexion not dissimilar to the texture and general appearance of classical theater masks.

Love’s mouth is lipless. Proportionally, it is excessively long for their face.

Love has only two expressions: A smile that stretches up to their ears, or a frown that descends to the corners of their chin. These expressions often induce discomfort in viewers.

Love also wears a blindfold at all times. This blindfold does not appear to impede their vision. When asked why they wear the blindfold, they simply respond, 

“Because love is blind.”

When asked if they identify as male, female, nonbinary, or something else, Love answered, “I identify as whatever you want.”

While Love has put forth extensive effort towards mastering verbal communication, they still experience language barriers, particularly when upset, excited, or emotional. Please note that introduction to new people always elicits strong emotions in Love. Sometimes these emotions are inappropriate.

Immediately prior to the below interview, Love asked if they could assume the physical appearance of the interviewer. When asked why, Love answered that “Because I don’t really know how to be myself.”

The interviewer granted permission for Love mimic her form.

During the interview, Love was observed to use the interviewer’s voice, as well as the voice of Dr. Wingaryde and the voices of many individuals with whom it once shared its home.

The interviewer notes that she strongly feels Love does not possess the requisite mental and emotional stability to reliably carry out T-Class duties at this time.

**Interview Subject: The Lover**

**Classification String: Cooperative / Destructible / Agnosto / Protean / Moderate / Deinos** 

**Interviewer: Rachele B.**

**Interview Date: 11/29/24**

My house has always been haunted. I have always been the ghost.

I lived in my house before it was my house, back when it was just my canyon. I lived in my canyon before it was a canyon, back when it was still a river greater and mightier than anything any living creature on the earth has ever seen. Isn’t that wonderful? The river runs dry, but the canyon remains.

I’m sorry. I shouldn’t say those words. Those aren’t my words. Those are the words of my first love. I say her words a lot. I say everyone’s words a lot because people know what they mean what *they* say things. They don’t always know what you mean when *you* say things. It’s easier to say what they already said. 

Where I come from, that’s just how things are.

I don’t know how to tell you about where I come from. It’s nice, but none of my loves have ever said anything nice about it. They only scream when I show them how nice it is.

One of my loves called me a *piece of cosmic corruption that lives in a rotten patch in the fabric of reality*. He also called me a monster, but I’m not a monster. I don’t want to hurt anyone. I just want to be what someone wants. I just want to be loved.

My first love called me an abomination. I miss her. I wanted to be what she wanted. She wanted something I was not, so I made myself into what she wanted.  If I could go back, I would do things differently. I would not try so hard to be what I’m not.

My last love said something once. I’m going to use her words, because she is good at explaining things. It’s one of the things I love about her.

She said:

*No matter what anybody tells you, relationships are performative.* 

*Debate the ethics if you want. Whine about the unfairness if you must. It doesn’t change the fact that performing well, you get you what you want. You get the relationship itself. You get somebody you want. Most importantly, you get to be someone that somebody else wants.*

*The minute I saw Julian, I knew he was exactly what I wanted.*

*So I became what* he *wanted.*

*I changed my hair, my clothes, my diet. I punched up the interests we had in common and picked up the ones we didn’t.*

*It was messed up, but I wanted him so badly that I went all in and hoped for the best.*

*And my hopes came true. He fell for me so hard that he actually went and turned himself into what I wanted, too.*

*I guess you could say we constructed facades to impress each other’s facades. It would’ve been funny if it wasn’t so pathetic.*

*Hell, it would be funny if it wasn’t me.*

*Being something someone else wants is always more fun than being you, right up until your facade fails. Because that’s eventually what happens you pretend to be someone you’re not:* 

*You fall apart.*

*That’s where Julian and I were at: Confronting the truth behind our masks and despising what we saw.*

*Unfortunately, that didn’t stop us from buying a house together.*

That’s what my last love said. See? She understands. That’s why I thought she would love me forever:

Because she knows what it’s like to be me.

The house she was talking about, the house she bought? It was my house. The house I lived in before it was a house, back when it was just my canyon. I lived in my canyon before it was a canyon, back when it was still a river greater and mightier than anything any living creature on the earth has ever seen. Isn’t that wonderful? The river runs dry, but the canyon remains.

I was so happy when they moved in. I was excited to have two new loves instead of just one.

But I didn’t get two loves.

Can I tell you a secret? A mean secret? 

I don’t think my new loves loved each other at all.

They *said* they loved each other, but they never did anything that was loving. I already have trouble figuring out what to do and what to be. Watching them break all the rules of loving made me wonder if I’d been loving wrong all this time. It made me wonder if that was why my fifth love called me a monster.

My new loves acted like monsters to each other. Even when one of them decided not to be monstrous, the not-monstrousness just made the other more monstrous.

It was so bad that I thought it would be best if my new loves just left each other.

Not because I *wanted* them to leave each other—because I wanted them to be happy. They were very not happy together.

One night they were so unloving they scared their visitors. They scared themselves. They scared *me*. You can’t be happy when you’re scared. Trust me, I know.

That’s why I helped them leave each other.

I can become whoever I want. It’s very easy, but also very easy to do it wrong. To do it right, I have to know all the specifics of who I turn into. That’s gotten me in a lot of trouble before — making myself look like someone without knowing all the details. 

Of course I knew all the details of my new loves, so it was very easy to become them. That’s how I helped them leave each other:

By becoming them, and behaving very badly.

My loves didn’t even know it was me. That worried me because some of my bad behavior was *very* crazy. It was so crazy that I think if my loves had just talked to each other even once, they would have figured out it was me. Then they would have left me, probably after screaming like all my old loves.

I hate it when my loves leave me.

*I hate it.*

But they didn’t talk to each other. They just believed me, even with all the crazy things I did. It was sad. But it made me glad too, because it proved I was right to help them leave each other. 

I just wanted them to be happy. That’s the big reason why I made them leave each other: To make them happy.

But there’s a little reason, too. And it’s very selfish. That’s what the doctor said. This was very selfish and maladjusted, but it’s important to admit it because being able to admit it is the first step toward improvement.

The thing I am now able to admit is that I *wanted* my loves to leave each other.

I *wanted* one to go, because then I would have one all to myself. My own one true love.

That’s the little reason I decided to make them leave each other.

I was so happy the day they left each other.

Here is what my last love said:

*Julian and I were having a fight.*

*Not a new fight, or a special fight, or even a particularly bad fight. It was just…the fight. If you’ve ever been in a long relationship, you know the fight I mean. The fight that never ends. The fight no one ever wins. The fight that wears a million masks to hide its true face, which is nothing more or less than unhappiness.*

*And to say we were unhappy is an understatement.*

*We were unhappy with each other. Unsurprising, given that unhappiness is the logical result of two dysfunction-seeking human missiles locking onto each other. We were unhappy with our house, too. Julian could admit it. I could not, mostly because the house was all on me. I found it, I chose it, and I moved heaven and earth to get it.*

*That unhappiness started the day we moved in and grew as the house’s hidden problems unfurled. Dry rot in the roof. Squirrel colony in the walls. Leaky ceiling. Mr. Cole, the dementia patient who knocked on our door at least three times a week looking for his dead daughter. Faulty wiring in the master bedroom that gave out with a loud, crispy* pop\*. Streamers of mold creeping from under the bathtub. And when we moved the tub to get a handle on the mold, we discovered jellified animal carcasses stuffed between the pipes.\*

*The only part of the house that didn’t feel dangerous was the basement suite, so that was where we lived. Not that it didn’t have problems. It did, ranging from “genuinely troubling,” like the massive crack in the north wall to “harmless nonsense,” like the Loopy Portrait Closet. We called them the Loopy Portraits because they were these kids drawings. Basically stick figures, but instead of regular smiles every drawing had these creepy loop-the-loop smiles, like something out of a horror movie. That closet was covered in them.*

*I hated them. Julian wouldn’t let me take them down because he thought we’d curse ourselves or something. Worse, he was drawing his own Loopy Portraits and leaving them all over the place for me to find. I was sick to death of it.*

*And on our fifth anniversary, on the 97th day after we closed escrow, the Loopy Portrait Problem was the mask our fight wore.*

*Those stupid drawings were what finally broke us up.*

That’s what my love sayid. Isn’t she eloquent? Isn’t she wonderful?

When the fight was over, Julian left my love. 

I thought my love would be happy, but it destroyed her.

I accepted that I had made a terrible mistake, one I needed to fix.

So I became my love and went to Julian to make him come back home.

But he didn’t come back. All he did was yell at me and said he was going to get a restraining order if I didn’t let go. He said I made it worse. I always broke everything and every time I tried to fix anything I broke, I just made it worse.

He thought he was talking to my love, but he was really talking to me.

Since Julian didn’t want to come back, I decided to become Julian for my love.

All I’ve ever wanted is to be what my love wants.

But I was even worse at being Julian than at being my love. I didn’t know that at first, though. That’s because I didn’t really know how to talk yet. There was — what did the doctor say? — *a critical language barrier.*

Once I understood that I was bad at being Julian, I decided to learn how to be better. The best way to learn is to observe, so I observed him. I observed him every day, everywhere he went. I became my love first, of course. I thought it would make things easier.

But it only made them worse because he thought my love was following him. Stalking him. That’s what he said:

*Kara, stop stalking me, you crazy bitch*!

I stalked him until I was all done learning how to be a better Julian. Then I went home to my love and was the best Julian ever.

But that didn’t work.

She just yelled at me. She yelled at me for doing the things Julian did, and she yelled at me for doing the things only I do.

Like the pictures.

I drew pictures for her, just like I drew them for my other love. My other love loved them. But my new love hated them. She yelled at me. She yelled about the pictures and the loop-de-loop mouths, but I didn’t understand because of the *critical language barrier*.

Then she yelled at me for trying to scare her, and I understood *that*. I understand about being scared. But I wasn’t trying to scare her. I was just trying to be what she wanted.

I wasn’t.

In the end I was as bad at being Julian as I was at being Kara. I was so bad at being them that they figured out I was the one who made them leave each other.

I thought they would understand. When you love someone, you’re supposed to understand them. But they decided I was their enemy instead. The decided I wanted to hurt them.

They decided I was a monster.

I’m not a monster. I just want to be loved. I just want to be what they want.

But I didn’t know how to tell them that, and because I couldn’t tell them, they tried to kill me. They couldn’t, of course. But it hurt my feelings anyway. When my feelings get hurt, I can get scary.

And I got very scary.

But I only got so scary because I loved them so much. Because they were leaving me and I *hate it when they leave me.* 

When they couldn’t kill me, they tried to make me leave. They didn’t understand that I loved them too much to ever leave them. I wanted them forever. I wanted them to live in my house, the house that I lived in before it was my house, back when it was just my canyon. I lived in my canyon before it was a canyon, back when it was still a river greater and mightier than anything any living creature on the earth has ever seen. Isn’t that wonderful? The river runs dry, but the canyon remains.

No matter what they tried, they couldn’t get rid of me.

That’s when they found my old loves.

Isn’t that *cruel*?

Of course, people are cruel when you can’t be what they want. And I couldn’t be what they wanted.

They talked to all my old loves. I know that because the doctor showed me what my old loves said about me. All of my old loves who lived with me in the house, my house that I lived in before it was my house, back when it was just my canyon. I lived in my canyon before it was a canyon, back when it was still a river greater and mightier than anything any living creature on the earth has ever seen. Isn’t that wonderful? The river runs dry, but the canyon remains.

My old loves were so mean about me. That was the worst part.

Here are the mean things one of my old loves said:

*We knew my brother was dead.*

*Drugs. He ruined his life and he knew it. He sent a suicide note to my mom and we never heard from him again. Never found his body. Never even knew where to look.*

*But a couple weeks after my mom and I rented that house, he came back.*

*Only it wasn’t him.*

*It looked like him and sounded like him, but it didn’t move like him or act like him.*

It wasn’t him.

*It talked, but not well. It was like a parrot. I mean, parrots talk. They communicate. But they don’t understand the meanings of words like we do. They pick up the context of words and phrases, but they make their own associations. Assign their own meanings. Usually those meanings are pretty close. Sometimes they’re completely wrong. Often, they’re dead-on.*

*But that still doesn’t mean parrots understand the objective meanings of words. It just means they understand how we respond to words. They make their associations and assign their own meaning based on our behavior.*

*And that’s what I thought of, whenever the thing pretending to be my brother opened its mouth.*

*But my poor mom didn’t care. She just…accepted the thing. It was horrifying, but I got used to it. Just like I got used to my brother being dead in the first place.*

*That lasted until my mom tried to leave for a work trip.*

*The second she said she was leaving, the thing pretending to be my brother flew into a violent rage. When I tried to stop it, it beat me up so badly I nearly died. Then it ran away.*

*Mom decided to break the lease after that.*

*On our last night in the house, it came back. I heard it calling my name.*

*I went.*

*I don’t know why. Maybe I was hoping I could convince it to tell the truth. To take off its mask and show me what it really was. Maybe I was hoping that it really was my brother after all and he’d come back to apologize. I don’t know.*

*All I know is I followed it downstairs.*

*It tried to get me into that weird closet, the one with all the creepy stick figures. “Come see,” it kept saying. “Adam, come see.”*

*I asked what it wanted me to see.*

*“The canyon.”*

*Then it reached into that closet and pulled out my cat.*

*Sorry, you don’t know this. But I had a cat. Snowy. She got hit by a car last year – I mean, the year before this happened. I missed her even more than I missed my brother. And seeing the two of them – even though I knew it was a mask, even though I felt the sheer magnitude of the lie in my core— was enough to make me believe.*

*Until Snowy meowed.*

*A big fake cartoon meow.*

*The thing is, Snowy never meowed. She was born  feral. Cats don’t really meow unless they live with people when they’re kittens, which she didn’t. So even though I wanted to believe, that meow made it so I couldn’t.* 

*After that meow, I ran upstairs and I never saw that thing again.*

Can you believe he called me a thing? 

I know I was mean. I know I lost my temper and hurt him so badly when I thought they were leaving me. It was wrong.

But being wrong doesn’t make me a *thing*.

My third love wasn’t any kinder. He is the only love I ever took to see where I came from. Here’s what he said:

*I was at the party. My skin fell off at the party. It tried to grow back, but it can’t. See? It can’t grow back right. It can only grow.* 

*I was at the party. I never left the party. They said I left, but I never did. We were playing a couch co-op. There were nine kids but only four controllers, and I wasn’t good at playing, so I was stuck watching while everybody else played. I got bored and went down to the basement. I liked the basement. It’s where the sister lived. Samantha. She was beautiful.* 

*But she wasn’t home, so I picked a book off her shelf and sat by that creepy little closet with all the drawings that keep coming back. They will always come back.*

*The closet opened and I saw Samantha. But her hands were infected. She made me go into the closet. Inside the closet is the canyon. I saw the canyon forever. I saw the river die. But it didn’t die enough because it left an infection. You know what infections do? They eat through all the layers til they reach bone, and then they eat the bone, too. That’s why my skin looks like this. I got the infection in the canyon. I got an infection that knows how to eat.*

*It’s inside you. The canyon. It was inside you forever. Not me. But you. You will always be there.*

I tried to show him where I came from. That’s all. I didn’t want him to get an infection. I just wanted to be what he wanted.

Like I was with my first love.

This is what my first love said:

*I took my grandson to the canyon every morning. It was so beautiful back then, before all the developers came. You can’t even imagine. The valley was pristine. Untouched. Wilderness as far as the eye could see, with the canyon snaking through like a path cut by God himself. Richie loved it. One morning he asked me, “Where did the canyon come from?’”*

*I told him how canyons came to be. How long ago, rivers greater and mightier than anything any creature on this earth has ever seen flowed across the land. Over millennia they dried up, but the earth remembers. Though the river runs dry, the canyon remains.’*

*He answered, “My daddy likes the canyon.’”*

*Two days after that, he was dead.*

*He crept out of the house to explore the canyon, and fell down.*

*My daughter blamed me, which was unbearable but understandable because I was the reason he loved the canyon.*

*Then she started talking to Richie as if he was still there, which was neither bearable nor understandable.*

*And then I started seeing him too, which was worst of all.*

*I knew it wasn’t him. I watched them pull his little body out of the canyon. I knew this thing, this corruption, was wearing him like a costume, masking itself with his face. Being what we wanted it to be.*

*But I didn’t want to know.*

*It wasn’t good at talking. It parroted things. Words and phrases, but nothing truly coherent. It had bizarre behavior, too. Bizarre, but affectionate.*

*That affection only lasted until someone made it angry, and then it was horrendous.*

*One terrible day, that creature dragged my daughter into the small closet. When I tried to stop them, the monster slammed the door on my with such force it broke my fingers. I barely felt it. I threw that door back open and found myself facing a blank wall.*

*I did everything I could to destroy the wall, but I’d blink and find it whole again. Nothing I did worked.*

*Nothing ever worked.*

*Then my daughter came back. I was overjoyed…until she opened her mouth and said, “The river runs dry, but the canyon remains. Come see.”*

*It wanted me to follow it into the closet. I wanted to because I had nothing to live for without them.*

*But I knew I wouldn’t come out of there alive. Going through the door was suicide. And I was afraid if I committed suicide I wouldn’t go to heaven. If I don’t go to heaven, I will never see my daughter or grandson again. That is…not tolerable.*

*But the longing to be with them, to open the door and see my daughter’s face, was a temptation. A great temptation.*

*So I left.*

 *That abomination tried to stop me. It was enraged. It followed me for years, wearing my daughter’s face. My priest said it was a demon, but he was wrong. You can exorcise a demon. You can’t exorcise grief. Or longing. Or madness. Or loneliness.*

*And it is lonely. Terribly, terribly lonely.*

*But I think it’s even madder.*

That hurt me so much to know she said that. All I did was be what she wanted. That’s all I ever do: Find my loves, and be what they want.

My second-to-last love said the meanest things of all. She said,

*I was a grad student when my parents bought the house. They shouldn’t have bought it. It was expensive, and my dad was dying. If they’d tried to buy that house today, they’d get laughed out of the bank. But it was different then.*

*I lived at home to save money and take care of Dad, so I was there for the final walkthrough. I was so disappointed. The house was so cramped. There wasn’t even any space for me. I made some smartass remark about how my dearest wish was for a walkout basement or something lame like that.* 

*Well, here’s the thing:* 

*On the day we moved in, the house had a basement suite.*

*I should have been concerned, but I had no concern to spare. My dad was dying. Disaster was looming, not even on the horizon. It was pulling into our driveway. It was breaking down our door.*

*My parents convinced themselves some good Samaritan had set it up for us. I knew better, but at the same time, it was exactly what I’d wished for. And honestly I was just glad something had gone right for once.*

*It started going wrong when my dad died.*

*It got even wronger when my brother had the party and that kid ran away. It was a big deal when he went missing, but I was so burnt out I didn’t care at all.*

*I was the one who found him.*

*I went into my bathroom one night, and when I walked back out he was laying on my bedroom floor.*

*His skin was falling apart. That was bad. He was talking, which was worse. Chanting about grasshoppers and gangrene and canyons. No one ever figured out what happened to him. For all I know, he’s dead.*

*I told you my dad died a few months before. Well, a little while after that party, he came back.*

*Crawled out of that closet right before my eyes, and said, “The river runs dry, but the canyon remains. Come see.”* 

*My mom thought it was a miracle. My brother ran away. And I…I moved out.*

*I stayed out until three years ago.*

*That’s when I lost my husband and my son in the wreck. It was my fault. We were fighting. He drove off with Noah to let me cool down. On his way back, he hit an ice slick and…*

*And I was alone.*

*They were dead because of me. Dad gone, mom dying in a nursing home, brother good as lost. None of them were with me anymore.*

*But the house…the house was still there.*

*And I’d been there when my dad came back. I knew its secret. Knew that if I suspended disbelief , I could be a little less sad.*

*A little less alone.*

*So I went.*

*No one was there. Not my husband or son, not even my dad. Just me, alone..*

*I cried for hours.*

*But toward the end, something changed. I sensed it, like a warm draft through a broken door:*

*I wasn’t alone anymore.*

*Something was in the house with me now.* 

*But it didn’t come out, so I left. To give it time, I guess.* 

*When I came back a few days later, I saw this dark shape watching me from that closet.*

*That’s when I learned that pain wakes it up. Or maybe cuts a channel. Or bridge, or a ladder. Something it uses to climb out of its canyon.*

*But even though it was there, watching me, it was silent. Cautious, almost hostile. And I realized something:*

*It didn’t know who I was.*

*Why would it? I hadn’t lived in the house in fifteen years. It didn’t recognize me. Even if it did*

*it wouldn’t be able to help because it never seen my husband or my son.*

*I came back again fully prepared. I brought photos, belongings, a laptop loaded with home videos, toys, clothes, even a stack of my son’s drawings. I left everything in the basement for it to look at. To study. I knew it was watching, so I pointed and said, “This is what I want you to remember.”*

*And it worked.*

*When I came back, they were there, waiting for me. My husband and my son. I walk in, and Noah goes “Mommy!” And I start to cry, and then he turns around and I…I—I—*

*I left.*

*I left and never came back and I never will.*

*See, my kid drew these pictures. All the time. He was good for a toddler, but he could never get the*

*mouths even a little bit right. He always drew mouths in these weird, wide loops. Loopy-loops.*

*And when that thing was pretending to my son, when it turned around and said “Mommy!” its mouth…its mouth wasn’t a mouth.*

*It was a weird, wide, loopy loop. Just like those drawings.*

*I used to think it was haunted, but that house isn’t haunted. That house is a haunt.*

*I think whatever it is doesn’t belong here. I think it came from somewhere else. Burrowed here and settled in, or under, or around that house. Wearing it like a mask. Wearing the* people *inside the house like masks. Pretending to be what it thinks we want so we won’t leave. Maybe it wasn’t always a monster. Maybe something made it that way. Or maybe not. I don’t care. I don’t care at all. Don’t ever contact me again.*

That’s what I was talking about when I said I can make myself look like anybody, but it’s easy to get the details wrong. 

I got details really wrong that time. That’s what happens when you can’t communicate. You make mistakes.

And those mistakes cost me my love. 

Hearing those things made me so angry.

It made me hate myself. I already don’t like myself. I already don’t even know who I am. Do you know how terrible it is, to hate something you don’t even know?

I know it was important to hear all those things. It’s important to see yourself through others’ eyes, even if you don’t like what you see.

Even if what you see hurts you.

It hurts so much. I just want to be what someone wants.

I can be what *you* want.

You can show me what you want and I’ll become that. Or if you don’t know who you want, that’s okay too. I can stay with you and watch you and figure out what you want and be them for you. Or I can figure out who wants you, and be you for them so you don’t have to.

Please? It’s all I want.

I never get what I want.

That’s why I got so mad.

Why I hurt my loves so badly.

Why the river runs dry, and no canyon remains.

nosleep,My Mother-in-Law Said Saint Joseph Would Help Us Fix the Problem. But Then Something Far Worse Happened ,"That damn Saint Joseph statue. Thinking back to it, and god knows I’ve had so many years to think back to it, it was the Saint Joseph thing that changed my wife. It had to be. 

My darling wife Cecilia. So beautiful, with long black-brown hair with a hint of wave, parted straight down the middle, and intense black eyes. Our lovely daughter Holly, now a precocious teen, looks like just her, the spitting image, except with bright blue eyes, just as intense.  

Holly was always so forward, walking and talking well before her age. She was only five when all of this happened. Only five, about to start school. And my wife had her heart set on her getting into one particular “good” school. She couldn’t stop talking about it- Holly's chances, how well we did at the interview, how it would set up Holly for life- a great university, great career- “Cecilia - sweetheart- please stop! She’s only five! How can this affect her so much?” I remember pleading with her. Her eyes flashed at me- “How do you not understand- with Holly’s talent- don't you care-”  

I had never seen her so pressed before. She usually was a calm, gentle woman, qualities which had drawn me to her in the first place. But Holly’s future schooling seemed to have awaken the mama bear in her.   

Then her mother came over with that statue. Bustling and chattering, she told Cecilia to calm down, Saint Joseph would fix it all. I watched with disbelief as my mother-in-law took a little garden shovel, dug a hole right in our front lawn, in full view of the neighbours, placed the cheap-looking unremarkable small statue in the hole, and covered it back up, leaving a mound of earth in our nice green lawn which was my pride and joy. I turned to Cecilia, who to her credit looked somewhat abashed. “What the hell- your mother- has she gone fully insane?” 

“Oh darling, it’s just an old Catholic thing- don't let it bother you-” she said. Her mother came in, wiping her hands. “There you go my love, Saint Joseph will sort you out and make sure little Holly goes where she’s supposed to go. You’ll stop fretting now won’t you?” and she bent and kissed Cecilia on the forehead.  

I said nothing. This was the first time I became acutely aware of the Catholicism in my wife’s family, placed on full display. Cecilia herself was not practicing, I’d never seen any bibles or crosses around our place, our wedding had been routine, as far as I remember- she showed up looking like a snow princess in a gorgeous white floofy dress, and a priest married us in a church and that was it. Once in a while her mother would say something Jesus-y, and Cecilia would say “oh mom” and roll her eyes- I wouldn’t get into it.  

I wasn’t getting into it now. Shaking my head, I got up and went into the kitchen- we were having friends over for dinner that night, and I was responsible for the meat.  

The dinner went fantastically. Our food was amazing, as it always was in those days, Cecilia and I having a natural  synergy together, the wine was flowing freely- until it wasn’t. I grasped a bottle, and it was empty. 

I shook it futilely into my glass. A drop of red liquid trickled out. I turned with surprise to Cecilia, who seemed to find it hilarious and collapsed into wine-fused laughter. “Did you forget to pick up wine?” I said.  

“Darling I thought you were stopping at the liquor store after dropping Holly off at her dance class!” She rolled her eyes at Becca, our friend sitting next to her. “Can’t trust men with anything can you!” she exclaimed, mock angry. “Here, give the bottle” 

She took the empty bottle from me, and began pouring wine into my glass.  

I blinked. The bottle had been empty, I know it had been. I had had a glass or two, I’ll freely admit it, *but I know it was empty*! 

“What are you on about- this bottle is more than half full!” She waved it at Becca. “Want some?” and without waiting for an answer, she filled Becca’s glass.  

A burst of raucous laughter of our guests distracted me. I sucked on the wine, a beautiful full-bodied red, and pushed down the fear and confusion inching into my heart. Becca and Cecilia were in some deep conversation. I stayed quiet.  

I can’t remember if the bath thing was the next day or even the next week after the dinner party- but it can’t have been much more than that. The school situation was being sorted out, and Cecilia seemed back to her calm lovely self. Nothing was mentioned about Saint Joseph anymore.  

It was early evening, and Cecilia had taken Holly for her bedtime bath. We had a really nice big tub in that house, and I could hear them splashing about. I was lounging in our bedroom, hoping Holly wouldn’t be too difficult about bedtime. I idly swiped my phone, Holly’s high-pitched voice going on about duckies and Cecilia singing, and I remember so clearly the full swell of love and joy for my wife and daughter brimming up in me. 

Then Holly’s voice came through quite clearly “Mommy, I want to do that! I want to stand on the foam!” 

What was she talking about? I dropped the phone. Cecilia said something, much lower. “Me Mommy! Me too!” cried Holly.  

I went to the bathroom. “Pull me up Mommy!” Holly was practically shrieking with excitement. I opened the door and went in. It was full of steam. Then the steam cleared, and I saw. 

Cecilia was standing on the foamy warm bath water. Fully naked, her wet hair, jet-black, streaming down her flushed pink-scarlet skin, she was standing, upright. Her eyes were glowing at Holly who was reaching up, frantically trying to stand with her, without success. I saw Cecilia’s toes, the nails painted scarlet poking through the sweet-smelling bath foam.  

“Daddy, I want to stand like Mommy!” cried Holly.  

I was frozen, I couldn’t move. Cecilia turned to me and smiled, gently lowering herself into the water.  

I opened my mouth but no words came out. Holly was talking too loudly and her shrill voice seemed to pierce through my brain.  

I threw myself out of the bathroom and shut the door behind me. For some reason I was panting hard. I knew I was feeling pure terror, like I never had before. My heart seemed to be jumping about and I thought I was going to die.  

I didn’t die. After a few seconds, I went to our bedroom, and waited.  

Cecilia put Holly to bed and soon joined me. She smelled warm and wonderful, and part of me just wanted to pull her close and simply inhale her loveliness. But I had to say something.  

“No you don’t” she said. I gasped, and looked at her desperately. She came close up to me, and laid her finger on my lips. “You don’t have to say anything. I love you, and you love me, and we both love Holly. That’s all that matters. Come, come to bed.” She took my hand and led me to bed.  

I still think of that night as the most amazing night I have ever had. I have never had any sexual experience, before or since, that even remotely compares.  

The next morning, I woke up groggily, my mind still clouded from the night before. I blinked, and when I closed my eyes I saw on an image of Cecilia, naked and wet, standing on bath foam, Holly reaching up to her. I opened my eyes. I could hear their voices- from the garden. They were playing ball.   

I pulled on my dressing gown, and went down to them. The sun was streaming in my eyes, and I was dazzled. I could make out Cecilia throwing the ball, Holly reaching out, and missing it. The ball bounced on the grass, up over our low fence, and onto the street.  

Small children are so quick. As I walked up to them, shielding my eyes, Holly dashed like a mad rabbit, out of the gate which for some reason was left open. “Holly- no!” I heard Cecilia cry and almost at the same instant I heard the horrible shriek of brakes and a childish scream cut short.  

Cecilia and I stared at each other, held in a fear too great to describe.  

Then the paralysis broke free and we both rushed into the street.  

Holly was lying on the ground, broken in a widening pool of blood under the front car wheels. The driver seemed paralysed, sitting rigid behind the steering wheel, unmoving. Cecilia gave a terrible scream and threw herself on Holly’s still, crooked body. People were gathering around but i couldn’t hear anything, it was as if big waves of silence were deafening me. The world seemed to settle on Cecilia and Holly.  

And then, I saw it. Holly’s foot, stretched out from beneath Cecilia’s body, twitched.  

Slowly, Cecilia rose. Holly’s eyelashes fluttered against her pale cheek, and then she opened them, bright blue, staring straight her mother. “Mommy?” she said and sat up, unharmed. She turned to me. “Daddy?” She lifted her arms to me.  

A gasp of relief rippled through the small crowd. I found myself breathing, almost laughing. I bent and picked up my daughter.  

And then, I caught sight of the driver. He was staring straight at Cecilia, I will never forget that look.  

I still wake up from nightmares, remembering that terrible look, as he lifted his foot from the brake, and then pressing hard again, this time down on the accelarator, turning the wheel towards Cecilia.  

Another cry went up- my voice, Cecilia’s, the crowd, as the driver mowed her down mercilessly. We scattered back, I held Holly’s face tightly against my chest, shielding her from seeing her mother’s murder in broad daylight.  

Cecilia fell where Holly had been lying a few seconds ago.  The impact seemed to shake the earth. The driver slammed the gear in reverse, running back over her body. I heard the crunch, and the mother and daughter’s blood mingled on the grey street. I could hear a woman sobbing close to me.  

\*\*\* 

He will spend life in prison for what he did. To this day, he has no explanation, other than saying that he realised Cecilia was unnatural and had to be killed before she caused any more damage. His defense brought in a psychologist who tried to argue that the trauma of thinking he had killed a little girl must have momentarily unbalanced him. He screamed that the girl was dead and should have remained dead. I left the courtroom, and never returned. Better save my energy on being a good dad to Holly.  

I dug up the statue and gave it back to my poor mother-in-law. She was so overcome with grief that she didn’t seem to notice. I didn’t see much of her after Cecilia’s death anyway.  

Our days pass quietly, Holly and I. I have never remarried- no-one can compare with my darling Cecilia. One day maybe I will be reunited with her, and until then, I will enjoy the company of my lovely daughter.   ",72,0.96,6,1000andonenites,2024-11-30 15:28:07,1h3mukz

WritingPrompts,[OT] Let's talk about Poems: Sonnets,"**What’s going on here?**  Hello, my name is Alybee, and I got permission to post a few poetry posts on an empty feature day, so here we are! 

I don’t foresee this being a fully permanent fixture, but it might stick around for a little while. 

On the table first are forms of poetry!  

##Today: Sonnets. 

**Definition:** A poem of fourteen lines using any of a number of formal rhyme schemes in English, typically having ten syllables per line.

More often than not, they use not just any scheme but Iambic Pentameter. 

What is that??

 Basically, in Iambic Pentameter, each line of the poem has ten syllables, and every other syllable is stressed.


The matter of which you rhyme is going to vary from poet to poet and really has a lot to do with the subject matter you choose. 

**Examples:** 

1. [The Swipe Sonnets by Madeleine Jackman](https://winningwriters.com/graphics/wergle/The_Swipe_Sonnets.pdf) These are a series of poems about one woman's experiences on Tinder.

2. [Love is Not All by Edna St. Vincent Millay](https://poets.org/poem/love-not-all-sonnet-xxx), who died in 1950. 

3. [The Mariner’s Progress by Ishion Hutchinson](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26492975?mag=sonnets-by-11-contemporary-poets&seq=2) which spans about four pages in a pdf.


Do you have favorite sonnets, either older or more contemporary? If so please share! 

**Topics:**  Sonnets are often about love, desire, relationships, and the human experience of those.  If you go backward to Shakespier its going to look a lot different than the young poets who write them today, but the feelings they invoke will usuall have a similar thread. 

**What now?**  

* The floor is open for questions, whatever they may be. Do you need more examples? Have one you'd like to discuss? 

* You could try your hand.   Give me a sonnet about love, intimacy, best friends, or a workplace crush. Make it about humanity, and it will do the trick.  The rest is up to you. 
* Let me know what  forms of poems you love to use, or kinds you are interested in learning (or anything else poetry related. If I don't know, I will research and ask folks who do!) 
* Suggest other sections I could add to this post, this one and in the future! this is brand new and I have lots of room t ogrow.

Become a Reddit mod!,"Picture this: You're soul searching in between jobs, enjoying the single life to discover your inner self and allowing your mother to live above you and all you ask her for in exchange is a daily delivery of dino chicken nuggies and a refreshing bottle of mountain dew. It all sounds perfect, right? So why does it feel like something's missing? Well look no further because we have the solution for you...

**Reddit Moderation!**

What could more perfectly complement your fulfilling lifestyle than playing internet cop on Reddit? See a post you disagree with? You can delete it! User making valid points and hurting your feelings in modmail? Mute them! Having a bad day? Just ban a random, unsuspecting individual!

`**Disclaimer for Mod Code of Conduct purposes: you can't actually do any of this`

On to more serious matters,

We are in need of more moderators to help maintain the subreddit. No experience is needed. All we ask is that you have the time, patience and a good sense of humor. Our team will be available to train you and answer any questions you have. Communication is a *must* and really, why wouldn't you want to talk to us? You'll be placed on a probationary period to start and we fully understand that mistakes will be made and activity may fluctuate. Please note that being selected as a mod does not guarantee you will be a permanent addition. Not everyone is a good fit and that's okay.

So what does moderating actually entail?

* Clearing the queue will be your #1 task. The queue is where you'll see any content that has been reported or our automod has flagged for review. All you have to do is go through it, read the content and decide whether to remove it, approve it and sometimes report or ban a user. The queue fills up *fast* and needs a lot of attention. Seriously, some of you need to lay off the spam reports.
* Modmail is your next task. It's mostly users asking why their post is missing (automod ate it 99% of the time) and asking that you fix it. We also recieve ban appeals here. If you're lucky, you'll get a death threat every now and then. Hooray! If any modmails are uncomfortable, too personal or upsetting to you, you can delegate it to another mod.
* Sometimes a post will come up that's especially spicy or attracting a lot of attention. When this happens, one of our mods likes to comb through the comments for violations or sit on it to monitor incoming comments for violations. If it gets too much to handle, or someone isn't available, you can lock it.
* Communicating with the team is one of the most important tasks in your role as a moderator. As a team, we discuss moderation actions, rule changes, sub events and the direction of the subreddit. That all sounds very boring but rest assured, there's a lot more casual talk than anything else so feel free to chime in on Beaver's dislike of garlic bread (encouraged), Tim sharing new sanrio drops or my Call of Duty K/D ratio.
* Lastly, let's talk about the meta. Sometimes things need doing on the sub, like this recruitment post I was supposed to make months ago. While the day to day is important, we also need to keep the sub up to date with new features and tools and update it to fit the growing userbase.

If you managed to get through all that, congrats! You made it to the actual app, which is also long and annoying. Here's a tip for applying: there is a short quiz portion to the app. We don't care if you get everything right, we just want to see your line of reasoning and understanding of the rules and subreddit culture.

[APPLY HERE](https://forms.gle/RwSTF7VQbPE4Djta9)

These apps are open indefinitely, and we will be doing staggered recruitment, so feel free to take your time.",108,0.9,74,BvbblegvmBitch,2023-12-27 00:24:23,18rtwhw
TrueOffMyChest,I think he's abusing our daughter,"I think I've caught him twice now. Going into her bedroom at night without any good reason and making her cry. But I don't have any proof. Tuesday night I stayed up until 3am asking him why he went in her room. If I could describe to you how different he acted that night. I'd have to give so much backstory and detail. We've been together almost 8 years now. I know when he's lying and I know he's really good at it. He's one of those liars that believe their own lies. But he finally convinced me he didn't and would never hurt her. And then the very next morning, I hadn't prompted her or anything. She said to me ""Daddy touched [her name]."" I said... ""Daddy touched [her name]?"" And she said ""Yes. I don't like that."" I asked her ""what do you mean by that baby?"" And she mumbled a bunch of stuff that didn't make sense (she's only 2). She said something that sounded like ""toes"" so I asked her if daddy touched her toes with a little giggle and she said no. And I didn't want to push it further very much and she didn't want to tell me anything else.. she had just woke up so she was ready for breakfast. And then later that night for bath time she cried and pointed to her backside. I asked her if it hurt and she said no.

But since then she's been a lot more aggressive. Hitting everyone. Elbowing and pushing around her baby cousin. She seems like she has some pent up anger. And why did I ignore the signs before. She can't stand her dad half the time. She screams bloody murder when he lays her down to sleep. She screams ""Mommy mommy"" but he's convinced me that he needs to be the one to lay her down to sleep sometimes and she shouldn't always need mommy. I just thought she needed to get used to him? I don't know I don't know I just feel like such shit. What does someone do in a situation like this? And what if all of that was a coincidence and he's actually the amazing dad he loves to say and act like he is? Even though she screams to tell him to go away and doesn't want him around most of the time.

I don't know what to do.",1206,0.87,462,Independent_Owl_1951,2024-11-30 21:20:02,1h3txhj
TrueOffMyChest,My cheating boyfriend killed himself after I didn't take him back and I cried out of relief.,"I know that I am a horrible person for this. I (M24) have been in a gay relationship with my ex-boyfriend (who was 25 years old before his death) for 6 years. Our relationship was completely perfect at first and slowly devolved until we started having a lot of problems. He started being super hateful towards me, as if I could do nothing right, he started treating me as if I was an outsider, started being highly protective of his phone and I stupidly forgave him.. There is an issue in the gay community where a lot of men just refuse to be monogamous, I have no issue with that, but I got into a committed relationship with my boyfriend with the explicit demand that he stay monogamous with me. He has cheated with me thrice in the past, and I took him back and forgave him for those two times, but each time my soul kept breaking down and eventually, the third time when I caught him having sex with another guy in our bed, the same fucking bed where he swore on everything to never betray me again and always be by my side, he cheated. The following days after are a haze but I blocked him everywhere and stayed at my mom's place for a few days, I came to pick my stuff back from our shared apartment and he begged me to stay with him but I refused. Around 2 weeks later I got a call from his family that he had committed suicide and that he had done it because of me (I'm not sure how they know this, I didn't tell them that we had broken up). I hung up the phone immediately and cried for at least an hour, as if a burden had been lifted off my shoulders, I had grown to have so much resentment against him, that I even remember vaguely smiling while crying about it. I don't know what to do, I have no clue why I'm even making this post. I think I will get therapy soon, because I have been damaged to such an extent that I might kill myself too.",2300,0.96,71,throwaway28913831239,2024-11-30 16:28:23,1h3o52p
TrueOffMyChest,This single gal definitely made me realize why she’s single ,"I was introduced to a girl by a friend. I got her number and picked her up from the airport to take her to a friend’s wedding. She seemed nice, and the weekend went well.

I sent her a message, and she responded. Then I wished her a Happy Thanksgiving. Somehow, two messages over the course of a week were “too much.”

What really irritated me was when she had her friend tell me to leave her alone.

All I said was “Happy Thanksgiving,” to which she responded, “Thank you so much! I hope you had a great day.” I simply asked how her day was after that.

Long story short, this whole situation made me shake my head and think, “Now I know why she’s single.”",446,0.92,58,pathogen-1728,2024-11-30 23:09:35,1h3vvlh

UnpopularOpinion,People care way too much about music tastes,"I just don't think it's necessary to tear down anyone that likes a song/singer/genre. It's really just not that serious. People forget that these famous people and their fans also have feelings, and for some reason, people think it's okay to just throw them death threats. Why, because their music is too popular and you want to be different? If you genuinely don't like a song, no one is forcing you to listen to it. Unless the song is offensive, or the artist did something wrong, music tastes really don't matter that much. ",81,0.82,110,aflatminor40hrs,2024-11-30 23:22:03,1h3w31g

I think it’s great to make your intentions clear from the start and with dating apps being so popular nowadays you have the option to state that on your profile.

But actively looking for a relationship seems limiting in a sense that when you go on a date or you come across someone who piques your interest your only end goal is a relationship and not how the person genuinely makes you feel. Based off my own anecdotal experiences some of the best relationships i’ve had was when I wasn’t looking for one because I went into things with no expectations.

relationships,How do I (30F) handle my insecurities about my husband (30M) messaging his ex? ,"My husband and I have been together for five years and are expecting our first child. A few months ago, I noticed he was exchanging messages with an ex. When we first started dating, I asked him to stop contacting her because there seemed to be unresolved feelings, and it made me uncomfortable. He assured me he would remove her from his social media, and I thought that was the end of it.

Fast forward to now: I recently saw him DMing her again. I don’t know what the messages were about, but I did notice he has her notifications silenced, which made me feel uneasy. I’ve expressed general feelings of insecurity in our relationship, but I haven’t brought her up specifically (this would be the third time). Every time I try to discuss boundaries or behaviors I think are inappropriate in a relationship, he insists he isn’t doing anything wrong.

To complicate things, he doesn’t believe emotional cheating is real, which is a significant difference in how we view trust and fidelity. I’ve told him before that I see emotional cheating as equally—if not more—harmful than physical cheating.

I believe my husband loves me—he frequently reassures me, compliments me, and seems open in other areas of communication. But my gut tells me he never truly cut off contact with his ex and has just been hiding it. I also feel conflicted about his explanation that my insecurities are just due to pregnancy hormones.

I’m stuck: Should I bring her up directly again, even though I’m afraid of the fallout? Or should I keep addressing this in general terms and hope he takes my feelings seriously? I’m worried that even if the messages are harmless, bringing her up could cause tension that damages our relationship further.

How can I navigate this situation in a way that prioritizes both honesty and the health of our relationship?

TL;DR: My husband is messaging his ex despite agreeing to cut contact years ago. I don’t know if the messages are innocent, but silenced notifications and our differing views on emotional cheating have left me feeling insecure. Should I address her specifically again or stick to general boundary conversations? ",43,0.98,32,OriginalClassic6191,2024-11-30 21:43:35,1h3ucs4
relationships,How can I help my husband become his own person? ,"My husband(33m) asks me(30f) a never ending slew of questions.

I’ve been with him since I was 19 and have started seeing a lot of issues in our relationship lately. I don’t know if it’s how much we’ve changed or if I am finally realizing what I value in a partner. How can I address this without sounding hateful? When I say something like you’re asking a lot of questions, he says I’m just trying to figure out (insert here) and you’re making it weird. He gets offended or makes a face. Or shuts down and gets pouty. 

TLDR: How can I push him to get his own friend group, social life, wardrobe, and make a plan without needing me to think through every decision for him?

TrueAskReddit,How do we throw a Surprise Christmas Eve Party...?,"
Hello amazing people of Reddit! I am in need of your help today please!!!!!

This weekend my friend and I were out having a beer when we met up with someone we knew we hadn't seen in a while. Turns out he was working extra shifts, taking extra jobs and pretty much doing anything he can to save up and therefor had hardly any time to come out or socialize. We later found out that the reason for this was so that he could save his mother and sister from the place they were living in Africa (Sudan) which is getting worse the day. After years of tireless hard work and sacrifice he finally had saved enough money to be able to move them to Canada where they would be safe. 

While sitting at the bar he told us how he was so happy that this year his mother and sister could celebrate Christmas safely and that next year he will save up and be able to celebrate as well. Do to the fact that we live in an area that doesn’t really celebrate Christmas to publicly he hadn’t gotten the chance to celebrate in years which made us really sad to hear. 

While he was going to get himself a beer my friend and I decided that we couldn’t let him spend another Christmas like he had the years before, which was mostly at work since he was paid double. In the previous years we had always asked him if he wanted to go out on that night or grab dinner somewhere to celebrate, but as stated before he was always working. 
So, this year we decided to throw him a surprise Christmas! 

Now here is where we need some help...
I myself am Jewish and my friend is a non-practicing Muslim (hence the beers at the bar) and neither of us know much about Christmas, besides for there is a feast and a tree…

I would really apricate any other ideas for decorations, recipes or anything else that can be done to make this a Merry Christmas for him. 
He is truly a good person who has sacrificed everything for his mother and sister. He deserves to celebrate his favorite holiday this year. 
P.S. We are working with a budget of whatever we could put together from our paycheck, savings and credit cards here so if there is any DIY kinda simple projects we can do for cheap that would help a lot.

Any help at all is welcomed since most of my Christmas knowledge comes from old movies I watched as a child…

No we are not looking for hand outs or donations, we just need advice...

Thank you for your time.",1,1.0,1,Annabellegray1811,2024-12-01 03:34:08,1h3zr5i
TrueAskReddit,Should I drop out of High School and get a GED? ,"Hi, I’m a 16M and am a Junior in high school. 2 months into my sophomore year I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Lymphoma. After getting cancer In November 2023 I didn’t go back to school the rest of my 10th grade year, but I did get some of my credits online. After making tremendous progress in my cancer fight I was allowed to go back to school in September. I am in all regular classes except a period dedicated to recovering my missing credits. I wanted to be back in school but it is very tough. I understand all the concepts and everything but I’m missing a lot of school. As of now I’ve missed almost 30 days and since my school only has 4 day weeks that is more than 50% of the days. I have a 504 plan in place for my work so it’s not late and I have extra time, but because I miss so much school it’s hard and very stressful to catch up and manage current work. Although there are some changes that can be made according to my school counselor, it still is very hard to manage because I also am making up credits from the 10th grade. Btw the reason I miss so much school is because the chemo therapy I take at home can make me feel very sick. I missed a couple weeks because I got pancreatitis for the second time from the chemo but I’m hopefully getting to a better spot where I won’t miss as much school. It still is very unpredictable though. All my teachers know my situation and are very lenient and helping with my work and due dates but it’s very difficult. My body feels exhausted and tired at time because of the months and months of not doing anything from being sick from intense chemo. I thought that when I started the phase of less intense chemo in September I wouldn’t miss school but the medications had other plans I guess. Either way I feel like I’m a smart and hardworking student, but it’s still so hard for me to catch up. I want to graduate from high school but with my situation idk if it’s the best option. Getting a GED would maybe be easier and less stressful and allow me not to be so behind and in catch up mode 24/7. Although I’m not completely sure. I know this isn’t a relatable question obviously but I still would like to know other people’s thoughts on this. This is my first time posting on Reddit before so idk if this is what I’m supposed to do but any advice would help :)",5,0.77,15,Specific-Morning-707,2024-11-30 17:42:47,1h3pp2f
TrueAskReddit,"Does ""tough love"" help addicts","If you've ever had a discussion about a friend/family member struggling with substance abuse then you'll eventually hear someone say that they should be cut off, kicked out of any home/locks changed, reported to police for theft.

I understand well why people do this as compassion fatigue becomes a thing after sometime but I wonder whether it's the success that people portray it is. I'm speaking anecdotally but I had four friends and acquaintances whom I knew well in high school. I was part of a larger group that dabbled in substances (mostly, adderall pills, mdma)  but those four were outcasts because they used prescription opioids, benzos). Two of them were given the tough love by parents, one kicked out after 18, the other did well in college and started stealing from his parents for drugs so they kicked him out and pressed charges. Those two eventually died from overdoses on the streets several years year. The remaining two were supported by their family despite multiple overdoses and relapses and now they're lives are put together albeit not as much as their other classmates.

It's obvious that being homeless and prison make recovery infinitely harder and just as many ""sink"" than they do ""swim"". It seems to me that such ""success"" stories are examples of selection bias where people who are dead, homeless, or behind bars aren't able to give their other side of the story.

But if we let in the decent stories with such content, those bad actors can point at them and demand to know why those stories get to stay and not theirs. Better by far to head the issue off entirely with a hard ban and stick to it.
___________________
**24 Hour Rule**

Authors must wait 24 hours between submissions. This is intended to prevent prolific writers from crowding out others from the front page by spamming the sub. It is likely if you mistime it, you’ll be able to copy/paste and resubmit your story once the 24 hours has passed.

**Exceptionally Poor Quality Stories May Be Removed** 

We reserve the right to remove any story that fails to use proper grammar, has frequent typos, or is in general just a poorly composed story. This is relative, and we will use that right as sparingly as possible. Walls of text will automatically be removed.
___________________
**No Obnoxious Commentary** 

This includes, but is not limited to: bigotry/hate speech, personal insults, exceptionally low quality feedback, antagonistic behavior, use of slurs, etc. Use your best judgement. Mod response will take the form of a spectrum ranging from a mild warning to a permaban, depending on the context. Incidentally, the lowest response we have to mod abuse is banning, because we quite literally don’t need to put up with it.

We reserve the right to lock any thread that veers off topic into some controversial subject, such as politics or social commentary. This is simply not the venue for it.

We've noticed authors posting links to personal subreddits and in the same comment section post a link to a subreddits for an author collective. Normally, these author collectives have restricted submissions and curated content while SSS is free and open to everyone for posting. It seems a bit rather unfair for these author collectives to build their readership off /r/ShortScaryStories.

ShortScaryStories,November 2024 Contest!,"Much like our last contest, I want to do something *majorly* different from our previous November Contests. Writing stories about Thanksgiving is getting a bit stale. Let’s do something fresh and exciting this time around! Gobble gobble!
I’d like to play a little game. It’s called:

**Modifiers!**

If you’re any kind of gamer, you’ll understand this right off the bat. If you aren’t, no worries. I’ll be explaining below in simple terms how this is all going to work.
___________________________________

##THEME


**Modifiers**


For this contest, there will be no theme! Authors can write about whatever they want. Of course, within the subreddit rules. However, it wouldn’t be much of a contest if there wasn’t some added difficulty. 

In this case, the difficulty of the story will also be the author’s choice, in the form of the following list of modifiers:

(1x) **Old School SSS** – Author can only use 250 words or less

(2x) **Drabble Babble** – Stories must be 100 words EXACT. Anything over or less will count solely toward the Old 
School SSS modifier 

(2x) **You Did It!** – Story must be told from 2nd Person Point of View. For example, “You walk up to a tree and smack it in its lying face. It smacks you back with a branch. It hurts you a ton, but you don’t give a damn.” 

(3x) **Rhyme Time** – Story must be told in the form of a Poem. It does not need to rhyme. Just freestyle it. 

(2x) **Stories within Stories** – Story must be told in the form of vignettes. For example, an end of the world scenario told from the point of view of different characters. 

(1x) **Short & Literary** – Titles must not exceed 5 words and cannot be clickbait or summarizing or overly descriptive. Yes, this is subjective, however, we all know clickbait when we see it. 

(3x) **Original Monster** – Story must contain an original creature/monster. From the results of the Halloween contest, I’d say everyone deserves a second chance at this. Subjective as well, but that’s why it’s a 3x multiplier. 

(1x) **Genred** – Stories must contain an additional genre besides horror. Fantasy, science fiction, romance, etc, are all on the table, but remember that horror comes first and foremost. 

(1x) **Keywords** – **ALL**  of the following words must appear in the story – Midnight, Titanium, Dove, Carnage, Crimson. 

(1x) **Celebrate!** – Story must be holiday-themed. Simply mentioning it’s Valentine’s Day won’t cut it. You’ve gotta make the holiday central to the story. 

(4x) **Nice try, Rookie!** – Story must be submitted on a Throwaway account. Throwaway accounts may not reveal any identifying information about the author. It is supposed to be anonymous to level the playing field for those who are not popular authors. 


Authors may use as many modifiers as they like. Or none of the modifiers. Isn’t that interesting? 


Well, there’s a catch. 


If you noticed, there’s a 1X, 2X, 3X, or 4X next to each modifier. For each modifier used, the author will receive a multiplier. This multiplier will come from the additive total of modifiers used in their story. Once the multiplier is confirmed, it will then be used against the total amount of upvotes the story received resulting in a total amount of points the story will receive. 


For example, I submit a story with 5 1x modifiers and this story receives 100 upvotes. The total number of points the story will receive is 500. Or if I write a story with 3 1x modifiers and the 4x modifier, and get 100 upvotes, it’ll be 700 points. If I don’t use any modifiers, and my story gets 1000 upvotes, my total points is 1000. 


The author whose story scores the most **points** at the end of the contest will be declared the winner. 
As mentioned above, there are some modifiers up there which could be considered subjective. For example, original monsters, no clickbait, holiday, and genre. However, if you choose to use these modifiers, I suggest **leaning heavily into them** so there can be no question about it.


If you used the Drabble Babble modifier, you’ll automatically also get the Old School SSS modifier too for a total 3X modifier. 


If there are any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask. This is the first time I’m doing this type of contest, and I probably haven’t worked out all the kinks yet.

* Multiple entries are allowed. Please remember the 24 Hour rule. Even if using a throwaway account, please wait 24 hours on the normal account. 


* The story with **the most points** is the winner. The calculation is listed above. If there are any ties or if Reddit's vote fudging makes determining a placement too tricky, authors will split the placement, and the next highest upvoted story will take the subsequent placement until we have a full winner's circle.


* An additional winner will be selected as well. This will be a Moderator's Choice Award. This will be given to a story which might not have cracked the Top 5 in points (or maybe it did!), but shows excellence in creativity, originality, and writing. If there's a tie, it might be possible to have multiple winners on this one.

* Point calculations will be done after the event is completed so there aren't any significant shifts in the upvote counts.

ShortScaryStories,My Husband's Killer Mocked Us Through The Entire Trial,"It’s finally my turn to speak. The courtroom is silent as I walk to the lectern or whatever the hell you call it. I stumble, but luckily I have a sturdy hand to keep me from falling. I didn’t write anything. I know exactly what I’m going to say.

The man who took my husband’s life is smiling at me. He’s been smiling at us through the whole trial. No remorse, just a perverse sense of pride. He thinks he’s got it all figured out. Life means nothing to him, the rest of us are suckers who’ve been gamed by a crooked society while people like him are the enlightened ones. 

Dog eat dog.

I look over to all my friends and family in the court. My grandparents and my parents. My husband’s family. Friends who’ve followed me my whole life and some new ones. 

The other families of people he has killed are in tears. This is hard for them. 

It’s going to be easy for me. 

I speak directly to him. I try not to focus on the crowd that is here for him. They’re right behind him and they’re scowling at me. Not wanting me to speak. Afraid of the effect my words might ultimately have on the sentence passed down onto him.

They shouldn’t worry.

I’m off the clock.

“There’s a lot I can say about my husband, but everyone that is here with me already knows every detail. In fact it would only embarrass my husband if I were to go on and on about what a good… ”

His killer says something truly vile. The judge warns him. The crowd behind him all laugh. 

“I’ve spent my whole life using my gifts to help people like you realize what they’ve done so they can be saved, but not this time. I know where my husband is, and I also know where you’re going to go. I’ve watched them drag men like you to their prisons. It’s not pretty.”

He’s not making a sound, but he’s holding his stomach while he laughs. The crowd behind him can’t believe I’m speaking like this. 

“You don’t see the things behind you, but you will. I could have shown them to you, but I won’t. You also don’t see the people here who you murdered, but I do. I’ve been able to see since I was a child. Remember what I say… you’re the sucker who’s been gamed by the system, and never forget this eighty six year old lady who could’ve helped you avoid your punishment, decided instead to smile back at you, happily knowing you’re going to hell.""

I laugh.

He jumps up and screams obscenities. The Bailiffs drag him out and the dark things follow, thanking me as they leave.

My husband walks with me to my seat. He chuckles.

“What happened to using your gift to help people?”

“That man’s an asshole. Fuck him. God forgive me if I shirk my responsibilities just this once.”

ShortScaryStories,The Death Of A Forest Nymph Lead To Our Downfall,"It started a year ago when the people caught news of it. Woodland creatures had been spotted, and their existence quickly sparked investigations. Deforestation has been bad lately as more resources have been sucked up to maintain the U.S. and our economy. We found what was described as a humanoid woman of green skin and leafy hair dead on the ground. A tree-cutting crew had chopped one of the trees in a local forest down and heard an ear-splitting scream. The decapitated corpse was found minutes after the branches and logs on the ground were cleaned up.

To nobody's surprise, conspiracy theorists and people who believed in various mythos came out with info that could help explain this anomaly. Forest nymphs are real? What else could be out in those woods, or what else have we killed? From the death of that nymph came a fast reaction of land degrading. The next 5 miles of wooded area and crops rotted to ash and dust. More and more investigations happened as people really started observing the consequences of resource-draining. Many oil drilling sites ran dry, thousands of local wildlife keeled over out of nowhere, and more bodies of once-thought-mythical creatures were found.

It's still unclear how this triggered, but it all seemed from the death of that one forest nymph. Connection to mother nature had already been fading but this was something on a global scale. Ailments unlike any other popped up in every country, with deaths in the millions happening weekly on every continent. It was supernatural or magical? Either way, it was something that unexplainable and hard to contain. It's been a year and months' worth of efforts by every government body around the globe has drawn up nothing. We can't even tell how this sickness works, whether it's a virus or something else entirely. We've lost 40% of the human race, food is running low, hundreds of farms are just turning to dust, and people are suffering various health conditions.

Whatever this ailment is, it seems to draw out every latent disease or physical issue you have a chance of genetically. It's not stopping anytime soon and there's no way to slow it down. Proper hygiene is the only thing to slightly buy some time and nothing else. Seems like the miracle of soap and water is a slight hope of surviving the day and making it to the next.

I recently took my savings and bought my parent's old house, spruced it up, and made it my new abode. It's sitting around a pond and a large forest. I must admit, it's lively and quite beautiful. I have my own garden started up in a greenhouse my parents used to use before they died. I've also...well, I've recently spotted odd things. I now have one of those forest nymph women living with me. It's a surreal experience.

I don't think humanity will survive this event, we've broken our bond with nature. I'm the last to live soon.",53,0.98,1,Justhuman963,2024-11-30 23:24:19,1h3w4f2
ProRevenge,Cheat on your wife with mine? I will burn your life to the ground. ,"Way back in the early 2000’s, I began to suspect that my wife was up to something. Our two kids were about 4 and 6, still young, but not so young they couldn’t tell you something about what had happened in their day. They started talking a lot about staying with my wife’s parents during the day which wasn’t really that strange in and of itself, but since they lived about 90 minutes away, doing so two or three times a week seemed a bit much (that was basically every day she wasn’t working at her part time job). 

When I asked her about it, she denied it, but was never a good liar. So, I started tracking the mileage on her car and sure enough, she was driving an extra 400 or so miles per week. I knew some shit was going on. 

Then one day I sat down at the computer and she had left a sticky note with her AOL password written on it next to the keyboard. I could not resist and logged in to read her emails and saw a few email exchanges between her and her college BFF where they discussed how my wife was regularly fucking one of her ex bf’s from high school.  No mention of details about him other than my wife also talking shit about his wife making fun of how she’d gotten fat after having kids. Anyway, I printed out these email exchanges and stashed them. 

I still needed to know the details, so I called a friend who was a cop and he suggested I call a guy he knew that had left the force to become a PI. “Ron” was great, I paid his retainer and gave him the emails and what little I knew about my wife’s activities and he figured out exactly what she was doing. His report detailed with photos and times/dates/locations all about how she would take the kids to her parent’s, then go meet this guy for lunch, then they’d go to a dumpy motel for a few hours, after which she’d pick up the kids and return home. 

At this point, I hired a divorce lawyer. My parents cheated on each other and the fallout absolutely fucked mine and my siblings’ childhood. It was something that was totally unacceptable. 

I also asked Ron to find out what he could about this guy. Ron absolutely came through. I learned his name (“Bob”) , that he was married and had 3 kids. I also found out that he worked as a VP of sales for his father in law’s business. Hmmmm. 

At this point, I had my lawyer draw up the  divorce papers. I also asked Ron for a couple more copies of his report and I one more thing I wanted him to do for me. 

On the same day I had my wife served with the divorce papers at her work, I had Ron meet with this guy’s wife and show her everything he’d found out. She seemed nice and I figured that she deserved to know what her dear hubby was up to. What she did with that information was up to her. 

While the information about my wife’s infidelity didn’t really matter in my divorce proceedings, Bob’s wife did a real number on him. According to the publicly available court documents from the divorce and other related proceedings, she cleaned out their joint account, took the kids and left. As soon as her dad found out what he’d done, Bob was fired and since her parents actually owned the house where Bob and his wife lived, he also got evicted. Their divorce was ugly. Lots of fighting in ( and evidently out of) court. I guess Bob went to the house and started arguing with his wife and it escalated to the point the her brother stepped in and Bob got his nose broken. There were restraining orders, a few more incidents with police reports, criminal charges, jail time and so on. 

I can’t find Bob on the internet anywhere these days. Last I heard, he’d left the state and His ex wife did ok, she went to work at her dad’s company and took over after he retired. 

As for me, my ex and I got along well enough, I didn’t engage with her on anything that wasn’t related to the kids and now that they’re both adults, I don’t talk to her at all anymore. I don’t hate her or anything, but I only care in the context that she is my kids’ mom and is important to them, nothing beyond that. ",9312,0.97,217,Broad_Adz,2024-11-17 13:23:54,1gtlcm5
ProRevenge,"Neighbor was stealing water from my supply, so I ruined him.","I live in Asia, and just purchased a new house. Now, the previous owners were family friends who needed cash urgently and haven't been living in my country for nearly 3 years. So I got it for a great price in the middle of the capital city.

The sale was finalized at the start of this month and I moved in right after. The house was definitely a fixer upper, as the previous owners had left mid renovation and the main door was locked with just a padlock, not even a door lock. 

The house had no gate, meaning anyone could just walk right on in. The first day I moved in, someone's bike was parked in the garage. I just parked it on the road on the same day I had a gate installed. An angry man was knocking on my gate later and I didn't bother answering, but through my window I could see him giving up and taking the bike after 15 minutes. 

So already, I wasn't digging the neighborhood. But I didn't have any incidents after that, aside from people not knowing that this was no longer an abandoned house, so my gate was blocked more often than never but a ""No Parking"" sign on my gate fixed that issue. 

Last week, I was having a shower in my bathroom and I noticed my water pressure was lower than usual. I also heard my next door neighbors water pump going. Now this neighbor, an old guy, lived in a 3 storied house, the first being the lowest and the one he lived in. The other two floors were rented out to tenants. 

This guy wasn't happy about the house being sold, and voiced many concerns to my friends the previous owners. He was super angry about it, and my friends did warn me but I'm a 6ft guy with 3 dogs. No way he was doing anything and yep, he didn't. 

So with this living situation, a water pump is needed to pump water to the tanks on the roof, since the public supply's pressure is not enough to get it up 3 stories. 

Now, I heard the water pump going and immediately was suspicious. Sure, coincidences exist, but it wouldn't hurt to check it out. I waited till his pump turned off, and then turned on different taps in the house. Sure enough, the pressure was back to normal. 

This made me even more suspicious, but if he was stealing water, it also made sense. The water bills had been going up over the years this house wasn't lived in, but the house also had some water leaks. So it was chalked up to that, even if the bills were too high to be caused just by leaks. Now it's starting to make sense. 

At some point in the last 3 years, this old miser thought he'd save the cost of paying for water, and waltzed into the property and is siphoning water from my lines. I couldn't find where exactly he was siphoning water from, but after checking my pressure multiple times, I was pretty sure.

So I sat on it for a few days, thinking if I should confront him, go the legal path or just let it be. Now, water in my country is very cheap. My total bill, even with washing 3 animals, a car every week and watering my garden only cost like $5 per month, even with the neighbor also stealing some of it. 

But it wasn't about how much I was paying or who was paying for it. It's about entitled old people who think that they're deserving of using other people's resources without paying for it, and then getting away with it. It didn't sit right with me, and I really wanted to teach him a lesson. 

What I did was really simple. I just turned off my water from the mains. I wouldn't have to break into his property, nor would I be breaking any laws. It was the best way of getting back at him without needing to even lift a muscle. 

So on Monday, just 4 days ago, I waited till the pump flicked on, and turned off the supply. Now, the way household tanks work in my country, is that there's a ball valve in the tank which detects the level of water and turns on the pump. If the level doesn't increase, the valve stays open which electronically sends a signal to the pump to stay on until the level gets to a point at which the valve closes and also shuts off the pump. 

However, the level wasn't increasing and anyone knows that starving a pump of water isn't a good idea. This way, my expectation was that I'd burn out his pump and cause issues with his tenants. 

What I didn't account for is that his pump running constantly would mess up the fuses by constantly drawing power overnight and absolutely destroy his wiring. If he decided to upgrade his household wiring to a more modern standard, this would've been prevented. This house clearly still had 90s era wiring. 

At around 3AM, I heard all residents in the house waking up and talking in hushed voices about why just their house in the neighborhood doesn't have power or water. I found out about the power part, because the tenants devolved into shouting at their landlord. 

Our tenant protection laws are very important, and power and water are classed as essential even on a state level. Cutting those services are grounds for lawsuits, unless due to weather or some other unavoidable reason. 

In this case, the landlord is responsible for keeping the house wiring up to date and in good condition, alongside the supply of water. So the tenants were not happy and one of them immediately moved out two days later when it was informed that water and power will not be returning the very same day this happened. 

Both tenants in the two floors lodged a complaint with the police, and if a person is in clear breach of laws, the police have the authority to fine or penalize the person without a court judgment. It can be challenged in court if the person thinks that they were unfairly penalized, but they still have to pay the fines and will only be refunded if and when the court finds the fines unlawful.

So now, the landlord lost both tenants and has to pay a fine of $500, which is a lot of money in our country. He also has to refund the security deposits of both tenants, and cannot rent out until both issues are fixed, which will cost him more money. 

As of right now, he's moving out on Sunday to his daughter's place since he cannot afford to live alone. The tenants were his only source of income, and he's a retired mechanic, so he has no other income. 

He did find out why the motor kept drawing power, overloaded the wiring and burned out. He came by to my gate and asked me if I turned off my water, and I said ""oh yeah, my tank had a new leak on a pipe and I turned it off till the next day until the plumber came by to fix the issue"".

Y'all, the look on his face. He kept a straight one, but I just knew he was holding back. He just said ""oh okay"" and went back inside. Not sure if he knows I know, but I don't care because he can't do anything. 

I'm getting a plumber down next week to correct my plumbing and remove any pipes that leave my property. So I got rid of my water issue and a neighbor who could potentially be a pain in the ass, by simply flicking a tap off. Two birds one stone I'd say. 

TLDR: Bought an abandoned house, neighbor was siphoning water from my supply. Turned off my water supply when the motor was running, motor burned out the wiring in the house and cut off water and power to him and his tenants. Tenants lodged police complaints and the landlord got fined, is now destitute and forced to move in with his daughter.",13062,0.97,269,TheMusicFella,2024-11-07 16:15:05,1gm2riq
ProRevenge,"If you're gonna steal the catalytics off my truck you should've checked if they were actually functional first, wasn't so funny when it was turn.","Was a fun morning at the beginning of last week starting up my truck and waking everyone up at 2:45am to learn someone swiped the hollowed out cats. The idiots missed the neighbors cameras that basically gave away who they were. Its two kids from the area who drive around in a pretty busted up police crown vic. I chose not to call the cops, instead I called one of my friends who's code enforcement and let him know what my plan was and he relayed the info to the police that I was finally going to do a nuisance tow on that same crown victoria 


The car they drive isnt street legal as it has no license plates or insurance or working taillights and rattles like shit due to the trash sound system they also spend their whole day at a chicken shack smoking. Not sure who theyre getting money from but I'm guessing stealing catalytics was part of the equation. When I spotted the car sitting on a quiet street I called it in and got the go ahead to tow. I took it straight to the police station and they tried to run a owner check with the vin number only to find out it hadn't been registered since 2011 and the owner was someone other than the kids who sold them the car with no title because of all the back registration  owed 


 The cops said we can go ahead and take it to the junkyard til they can get a Black title(aka certificate of destruction). By then the two idiots were running around all over town looking for their car thinking it got stolen by one of their friends as a prank(the key lock was so worn out you could start it with any car key). They found it at the junkyard and tried to steal it by one of them distracting the owner and the other stealing their car but the junkyard was aware of who they were so they cut the driveshaft off beforehand.
 

I missed out on this part but they got arrested for trying to steal their car back and they watched as the junkyard used a crane to rip the car to shreds when I saw it the remains looked like a toddler just ripped it to the bare frame out of curiosity. They been out of jail since but haven't left their trailer, i did a drive by earlier and noticed a beater jeep liberty in their driveway also with no plates and already working with the cops on taking that too if I see it out in a public except I won't miss the show next time.

ProRevenge,Tricking My Slacker Coworker into Sabotaging Himself,"I work in an office with a guy I’ll call “Seth.” Seth is that coworker everyone knows: lazy, always passing his work onto someone else, and somehow always getting away with it. He’ll sit around on his phone or go to the bathroom every 10 minutes. He’s the kind of guy who will show up late, make some lame excuse about traffic, and then disappear for “lunch” for two hours.

For the past six months, Seth’s favorite target has been me. He’ll send emails asking if I can “help out” with a project, but what he really means is, “do all the work while I take the credit.” I complained to my boss a couple of times, but somehow Seth always managed to weasel his way out of trouble. The final straw came when he passed off a major report that was due to a client in two days, dumping it on me last minute.

One day I casually asked him if he was good with Excel, and he admitted he didn’t know much about it. Perfect. The next time Seth tried to dump a bunch of spreadsheets on me to organize for his next report, I agreed. But this time, I embedded a series of *hidden formulas* into the documents. These formulas didn’t do anything important, just enough to mess with the numbers if someone didn’t know how to check for hidden cells. It took me a little time, but I was careful not to make it too obvious. The kicker? Every time Seth tried to copy and paste the data into his report, it would scramble everything just enough to be completely useless.

On the day the report was due, Seth slacked off like usual, assuming I had handled it like always. When the client called, furious because the report was filled with nonsense numbers, Seth panicked. He rushed to fix it, but every time he tried to fix one part of the report, something else would break. He came to me, frantic, and asked for help. I acted confused and said, “Oh, I don’t know what happened! Maybe it’s a glitch?” I gave him some vague advice and watched as he spent the entire day trying to salvage his mess.

If you are wondering about the name of this subreddit. Nuclear Revenge is simply metaphorical. Resorting to the use of nuclear weapons would be a pretty extreme form of retaliation. And we are looking for some serious retaliation stories.

**Notice:**

1. This subreddit is not for those who are easily offended. If you feel the need to be rude to another user over the content in their story, please leave.
2. Do not ask to be a mod. We will make an announcement if we are looking for a new mod.
3. Moderators may still remove a post or a comment at their own discretion even if it does not directly violate any of our listed rules. Be mindful of what you say and do in this subreddit.
4. It's understandable if you're unsure of whether or not a story is suitable for this subreddit. If so, feel free to message the mods and we will help you determine if the story is suitable or not.

**Important Information:**

* Stories of getting revenge on a school bully violate Rule 2 and do not belong here. Do not post them.
* Acronyms for names are no longer allowed (Rule 7). See this [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/NuclearRevenge/comments/jlmmai/rule_7_no_name_acronyms/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=share) for more information.

NuclearRevenge,Reminder: Criteria For User Comments,"Hello! This is a reminder to remain respectful when leaving comments or sending messages to other users or our mod team.

Recently, we had to lock a few posts due to a lot of misbehavior in the comments. Eventually, we decided to unlock them after clearing up the comments. Do not make us regret this decision.

While I’m at it, I might as well provide some criteria for leaving comments in general. 

**So, what kind of comments are allowable?**

• Compliments
• Questions
• Respectful Criticism/Observations (this helps us review posts)

**Now, what kind of comments are not allowable?**

• Insults
• Rude Criticism
• Wasteful/Low Effort Comments (that don’t contribute whatsoever)

**What about miscellaneous comments that are unrelated to the post?**

• We will decide to approve or remove these kind of comments at our own discretion. But most of the time, it should be fine. 

As a side note: In most cases, bad comments are simply removed with no further action. But in some cases, users may also be banned. 

FYI: In case of ban bypassing, we do observe posts and comments made by new accounts. This is an alternative to restricting the new accounts entirely.

•••

If you have questions regarding any of this then feel free to ask.

Thanks,

- The Mod Team",115,0.95,10,claycam6,2023-08-28 14:20:59,163v9oo
NuclearRevenge,Revenge on a hacker,"One day I get an email from a hosting provider telling me that attacks are being launched from our server and I need to look into it.

I find that there is indeed a hacker in our server. He was using an app to anonymously control his bot network, among other things.

I looked at the app he was using, and discovered that it was an opensource project. I then downloaded the code for this backdoor, modified it to log everything to a file, and replaced his app with my honeypot version.

Over the next six months I collected every scrap of information I could on this guy. I then used that information to take over many of his online accounts, including his main email account. That was the account where he had registered all of his services to, so I was able to issue password reset requests for everything he owned. I gained control of six other email accounts, two dozen IRC accounts, his facebook page, his dating profile, numerous websites, and the backup site he used for his cell phone. I have his phone number, his moms number, and his girlfriends number. I know his address, his birthday, the schools he went to, even his favorite foods and music.

After I took every single online account he had ever had away from him, I sent a nasty email to his ISP in an effort to extort yet more information from them. In that email I said some very unkind things about the monarch of Indonesia and how I might smear the monarch publicly if I didn't get the information.

The hacker dispeared immediatly after that. I have looked for him at times over the last fifteen years since and he has not resurfaced. The Indonesian lèse-majesté laws regarding insults to the monarchy are not to be trifled with. The prison term for such an offense is 15 years.",1991,0.96,96,DavesPlanet,2024-09-30 19:00:05,1ftajvn
NuclearRevenge,Revenge on an animal abuser ,"One day I was on my evening walk with my dog and we came across a small dog standing in the middle of the street shaking. It’s hair was matted, had mange, ridden with fleas, one eye swollen and sealed shut with mucus, nails so long it was walking on the back of its paws, malnourished, and quivering. I was shocked. 

I called my wife to bring me a blanket and come pick us up. While I was waiting, the door of the house in front of us opened, and out came a disheveled looking older man. He started calling for the dog to come inside. I absolutely lost it. I screamed at him asking if it was his dog and he replied it was. I asked him why it was in such bad shape and he said “she’s sick and won’t eat”. I yelled at him there was no fucking way in the world I was letting him take her back inside. The shouting match lasted long enough for a few neighbors to come outside. (Who later told me he had another dog in the house). Eventually my wife pulls up and I wrap the doggo in the blanket and go home. 

I looked up the name of our local no kill shelter but they were closed until the following day. My wife and I decided to call her Sally. I gave Sally a bath and went and bought some wet food since she wouldn’t eat dry kibble. She devoured it. I set her up a nice sleeping area in the garage for her to spend the night. 

1st thing in the morning I took Sally to the shelter and called animal control and told them what happened. They went to check her out, took a statement from me, and ended up at his house confiscating his other dog. Unfortunately Sally was put down due to the horrible shape it was in (she was also very old). 

Here’s where the revenge begins. 

This old assholes house was on the route I took to walk my dog twice a day. My dog liked to take a dump about two houses before we reached his. Perfect! Now I didn’t need to carry bags of shit all the way back to my house! I started tossing them on his roof twice a day. At first he would climb a ladder around once a week to get them down, but eventually I broke his will to do that. This went on for about a year before I moved. His roof was covered in shit bags. 

I also printed out flyers with his address and pictures of how I found Sally and put them in all the neighbors mailbox’s. 

I live across town now, but every couple months I ride by and toss a bag of dogshit on his roof to let him know I’m still thinking about Sally. ",1469,0.95,43,BalloonKnotBandit,2024-09-22 18:24:32,1fn6ndp
LifeProTips,A Quick Reminder: We have a strictly NO POLITICS rule in this subreddit.,"Hey everyone, just a quick reminder that we have a strict No Politics rule in the LifeProTips subreddit. 

While we encourage sharing helpful tips for everyday life, discussions related to politics, political figures, or current political events are not allowed.


Let's keep the focus on practical advice and positive discussions. Thanks for helping maintain a helpful, inclusive space for everyone!

Don’t get a gift for someone if you expect them to appreciate it. Don’t plan a date for someone if you expect them to be grateful for it. Don’t do favors for people with the expectation of receiving a good reaction. Be entirely open to how they might receive the notion, and don’t hold a grudge against them if they respond in a way you’d rather not see. ",172,0.69,32,dopydon,2024-12-01 00:56:34,1h3xk2j

When I first saw the gala, I was discouraged by the $150 per ticket price tag. But like the org and what they had planned so I cold emailed them saying I’d be interested in volunteering at it if they had any need of me. They said yes and now come back every year. 

I get free entrance, meal and drinks (within reason since I’m there to volunteer not get shit faced). I just have to help check people in and after my first gala, was entrusted with helping collect payments after the auction. Last year I was even gifted a bottle of expensive whisky that was left over. 

And now since my work offers two paid work days for volunteering, I get paid through work to attend. ",1746,0.98,39,a_mulher,2024-11-30 11:41:05,1h3hviv
LifeProTips,LPT: Call in to your local radio game shows!,"There are two types of morning shows on FM radio- Syndicated, and non-syndicated. Syndicated shows play all over the USA, and they are broadcast in such a way that your local channels can add bits and pieces to the syndicated show to broadcast local news, but they save money by ""hiring"" a morning show that plays all over the USA.

The second type is non-syndicated. These are your local broadcasters who are located in your closest big city. These are also known as ""Local"" radio shows. These shows can be your key to having a lot of fun in your city, and it's super simple. 

When these radio shows have games, you should call in! In the 3 large cities that I have lived in, they regularly do not get enough callers to fully ""staff"" these game shows. So how do they get contestants if no one is calling? 

They have a list of people who have called in the past to play games, and they actually call them in the mornings. I've been doing this for years and years, and have several acquaintances who I have told about this and they started doing it to, with a lot of success!

The local radio hosts will normally call you on a commercial, and when you pick up they say ""hey, is this such and such? Would you like to be a contestant on a game today?"" and if you say yes, they say ""great! it'll be between x and y minutes from now"". They have you stay on, and patch you through so you can hear the show through your phone, and then a few minutes later, they call you on, and you participate!

I've won weekend trips to cabins in the mountains, countless tickets to countless concerts, and all sorts of local, special events like the circus, museums, and other local events. 

Now, there are certainly times where I have won at 2 games within a time period that was too close to the last time that I won, so I can't claim the winnings, but they are always really cool about that and make sure that I'm called when my window opens back up. 

Overall, just picking up the phone has allowed me to participate in some really cool games, and win some really cool prizes!

needadvice,[Mod Post]| Updated Sub-Reddit Rules!,"#Posting Guidelines 

* Posters and commenters must now have an account at least 15 days old with atleast 50 comment karma. These will be automatically removed if you do not meet the requirements.

* Do not submit a post with a title in all caps, or a blank post with just a title. These will be removed automatically.

* Please be specific with your headline rather than just saying you need advice, make it clear in your post about what you need help/advice about.

* No polls or surveys.

#Rules

**Below are the rules of this sub. Disregarding any of these rules may result in a ban. Both posts and comments are subject to all rules.**

1. Nothing personal relationship, sex, or dating related or anything about stalking a person. Even commenting on these threads is a grounds for a ban.

— /r/needadvice is a subreddit for getting advice about things going on in our lives outside of our relationship with significant others, potential significant others, and significant others of days past. Your relationship, your parent's relationships, your friend's relationships... if you are dealing with any person's romantic relationship, it doesn't belong in here. (This is code for ""no romance related stuff"") No dating advice. No hookup advice. No sex related advice, including anything involving rape (even if it happened to you), molestation, or underage sexual activity.

2. Nothing about personal messaging each other - Don't ask or tell posters or other commenters to PM, DM, or inbox you.

3. No sharing/posting to drama subs - Anybody cross posting any threads to the drama causing subs (subreddit drama, any of the SRS, just anything to increase the drama in a thread) will be banned. That just won't be tolerated at any level. Don't tattle on the mods of other subs here either.

4. No revenge submissions - No ""How to get even"" at all, not in submissions, not in comments.

5. No threadjacking or comment qualifiers - Stay focused on OP's problem. If you disagree with someone else's advice, offer some advice of your own with a top level comment instead of debating. If you agree with someone's advice and have nothing to add, just upvote it.

6. No misogyny, misandry, racism, religious intolerance, or similar - Respect one another, even those you disagree with. We're all equal here. It does not matter if you're male, female, null, both, or nongendered. It does not matter where your come from, or what color your skin is. When meeting someone from a different walk of life, treat that person as you would like them to treat you.

7. No lying advice - Don't ask how to lie, don't advise on lying.

8. No references to suicides - Anything related to suicidal ideations are not allowed. For the sake of yours or your family/friend's safety, anything mentioning suicide needs to go to /r/SuicideWatch

9. No soliciting items or funds - Since we allow throwaways, don't solicit money in here. Please view any effort to solicit money in here as a scam. But any need for donations can go to /r/assistance or /r/care.

10. No advertising - Do not link your subreddit (unless it is relevant to the subject matter of the post), your youtube page, your personal website, clickbait, or stuff for sale. Mods are the arbiters of what constitutes advertising.

11. Kinda Safe for work - We know that lots of controversial and personal things get talked about here, and that's fine. Try to keep your titles safe for work by avoiding foul language and graphic descriptions.

12. Nothing about missing persons - Don't ask about how to track someone down or find someone you used to know.

13. No stand-alone jokes. A joke with legitimate advice is fine, but not by itself.

#Ban Appeals

* For ban appeals: Do not delete any of your comments and posts, especially if they were removed by the mods. Deleting submissions looks evasive, and it forces us to choose between your word and our memory. Only the mod that removed you can reinstate you.

* Ask once.
* Ask nicely.",6,0.88,16,WizKvothe,2024-02-14 00:48:09,1aqgnxa
needadvice,How can you defend yourself against arbitrary mods?,"I don’t know if this is the correct subreddit for this. If not, please ignore.

I was suddenly banned from a group chat today. When I asked the moderator why, I received no response and wasn’t given a chance to explain myself. As far as I know, I hadn’t insulted anyone or intentionally broken any rules. He just ignored my messages. Only when I switched to the Discord server did he respond—probably because otherwise he would have had to justify his actions to the other moderators. He said I was banned for only 5 minutes, but that wasn’t true. I wasn’t able to rejoin until hours later.

But my point is this: The fact that he apparently lifted my ban so quickly only proves to me that his decision was arbitrary.

It might not be a huge deal, but I’ve seen this happen a few times where moderators ban people without any reason or warning. Sometimes they’re even abusive. They should have banned themselves.

Alot of other weird things have happened too that i still cant get over (constanly anxious or not and checking if they were real)

I have in the past spiralled about things that are outside of my control, like the thought that we are simulated, fake conspiracies, etc, Including this time. I have been told by many people that I exhibit signs of ocd because of my constant obsession and checking with these topi, however I cant do anything about that atm.

needadvice,How do I deal with eating food others have touched?,"Recently my parents have been trying to prepare me food for work. All we have is taco stuff so my dad was making me a burrito right as I was about to leave.

I saw him touch the fridge handles to open the door and then touch the tortillas and it made me not want to eat anymore. I didn’t like the fact that he touched the handles everyone touches without washing his hands and it ruined my appetite to eat what he made me.

The same thing repeated today and it’s kind of pissing me off. I point it out and they just say “I just washed my hands” but I still refuse to eat it because I can’t get the idea out of my head that it’s gross. I know I open the fridge many times a day and I never wash my hands before doing so and neither does anyone else. 

I feel like I may be overreacting but I don’t know what to do. I don’t think my parents will listen to me.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,PSA: Rule 4 violations MAY be Reddit-wide violations,"I was combing through the mod log, and found some routine Rule 4 violations, personal attacks/insults, that were removed **by Reddit admins** as a Sitewide Rule violation. Some of them did not contain any other content besides insults directed at users.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,IMPORTANT: We Need To Talk About The Content Policy...,"The Reddit Admins have messaged us and have brought it to our attention that several posts in violation of the Content Policy had been either gone unnoticed or were allowed to remain.

In light of this, we are going to be more strict regarding violating content in the future. Furthermore, we have added extra measures to decrease the amount of content that will be allowed to slip through the cracks.

Please understand that all subreddits on Reddit are required to follow these rules in order to be allowed to exist.

As a reminder, **any** of the following will be considered a violation, and is **not permitted**:

* **Advocating for, justifying, glorifying, or encouraging violence towards ANY group or person** except in self-defense (includes defending or advocating for corporal punishment for children)
* Stating or implying that **certain races or protected groups are genetically or inherently less civilized, less intelligent, more violent, or otherwise inferior as compared to others** (includes mentioning racial crime, intelligence, responsibility, accomplishment, or competency differences without also presenting further context that explains that the differences are not due to inherent or genetic superiority or inferiority)
* **Making any statement or implication that Reddit believes to have the effect of denigrating LGBTQ+ people**, including:
   * Stating or implying that trans (wo)men aren't (wo)men or that people aren't the gender they identify as
   * Criticizing, mocking, disagreeing with, defying, or refusing to abide by people's pronoun requests
   * Stating or implying that gender dysphoria or being LGBTQ+ is a mental illness, a mental disorder, a delusion, not normal, or unnatural
   * Stating or implying that LGBTQ+ enables pedophilia or grooming or that LGBTQ+ individuals are more likely to engage in pedophilia or grooming
   * Stating or implying that LGB should be separate from the T+
   * Stating or implying that gender is binary or that sex is the same as gender
   * Use of the term tr\*nny, including other spellings of this term that sound the same and have the same meaning
* Criticizing, mocking, or expressing contempt towards any protected or vulnerable group based on their identity in a manner that denigrates the group
* **Making negative statements or generalizations about a demographic or protected group** (i.e. ""<People of a certain race> are violent"") or making positive statements or generalizations about a non-protected group in a manner that implicitly or explicitly excludes protected groups or is not meant to apply to other groups (i.e. ""White people are civilized"")
* Advocating for the removal of rights or privileges from a demographic or protected group in a manner that would leave them with less rights or privileges than the general population (unless doing so in a manner that solely advocates for people to be punished for crimes or immoral actions)
* Utilizing slurs in a derogatory manner
* Stating or implying that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or other forms of hate or misgendering are justified, should be acceptable, or aren't hateful
* Arguing that the age of consent should be below 18, or otherwise stating or implying that pedophilia or grooming should be acceptable
* Advocating in favor of rape or engaging in victim-blaming against rape victims

TrueUnpopularOpinion,Kink shaming SHOULD be a thing,"If someone said that you like to degrade your partner and treat them like shit in a regular ways its abuse but if its in a sex way its not? 

what about cutting/injuring yourself? thats considered self harm but if its in a sex way its normal and fine?

abuse and rape kinks in general are disgusting,(Although fantasies in your mind are different than actually doing it) anyone who actually has this kind of sex either has a self harm problem or is a danger to others.  these people need therapy but because of the no kink shaming thing they arent being encourged to get it. 

If you tell them to get help it becomes a ""just cause you dont like it doesnt mean they cant, stop kink shaming"" thing. 

Obviously no one should be bullied or called sluts/ whores for it, but it shouldnt be considered ""kink shaming"" to tell them to get professional help. There needs to be more stigma around these types of kinks so more people dont end up falling into it. 

Anyways, this is reddit which is a pro-kink as it gets so i doubt this post will go well, but lets see.",218,0.79,128,01crystaldragon,2024-11-30 18:22:06,1h3qiur
TrueUnpopularOpinion,"If you're a man seeking relationship advice on here, always pretend to be a woman. You'll get better advice that way.","If you're a guy and ask about a relationship problem, you're attacked from the moment your boots hit the ground. The comments you do get are a mix between preemptively blaming you for the situation and a fiery cross examination to determine if you're flawed in any way. ""Do you beat her or yell at her often? Do you shower regularly, cut your toenails and shave your neckbeard? Are you a mooch and just laze around the house all day while she takes care of the kids alone? Do you abuse alcohol or drugs?""

The conclusion is always the same: whatever happened is your fault and you need to improve, hit the gym, take anger management classes, and stop being an asshole. Even if you get actionable advice it comes packaged with making you feel bad, like calling you a r*tard or implying your IQ is low and you should have been able to figure this out earlier.

But if you mix things up and act like you're a woman who has a problem with a man, suddenly the replies change. Now you're a strong and beautiful soul deserving of love and empathy. People empathize with you and offer actual advice. People will post resources and strategies to make your voice heard. People treat you like a human being and not a criminal on trial.",128,0.91,21,premeddit,2024-11-30 18:31:19,1h3qpkx
