funny,Forging A Return to Productive Conversation: An Open Letter to Reddit,"To All Whom It May Concern:

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit’s most-popular communities. That time hasn’t been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we’ve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit’s headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools’ Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We’ve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven’t been completely happy about every change that we’ve witnessed, we’ve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit’s API; changes which – despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors – threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit’s statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit’s User Agreement and Reddit’s Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators’ behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of ""Moderator Advocate"" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood – its multitude of moderators and contributors – consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform’s many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit’s administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded… but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.

No, they did not swiftly and competently respond before she sped off very erratically and dangerously at 90+ mph headed south on Hwy 1. I followed from a safe distance and sane speed while on the phone with dispatch. I was told repeatedly that officers were approaching, but they never showed up! I aborted as they turned over the response to CHP. 🤬

gaming,"What game was truly ""ahead of it's time""? ","So this gets asked here from time to time, and frustratingly for me, it gets filled with highly upvoted  mention of trailblazer games; games that raised the bar or set the trend in some way or in some cases created whole new generes. (examples include Halo, HalfLife 1, Starcraft, etc.)  I get it. These are good games, popular and highly respected, but they are not what I would call ""ahead of their time"". To be ahead of it's time, the game simply needs to introduce concepts or elements that are not imediately picked-up. It does not even need be good or remarkable - it just needs to have elements that are so new and unusual that it goes unappreciated and forgotten. Here are three examples of games that I consider ahead of their time...

The Outfoxies:  a totally different take on the arcade fighter game (Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, etc.)  that became the inspiration for Super Smash Bros. many years later. The message at the start of each match ""Kill your oppenent by any means available"" meant the player could use whatever was lying around in the unusual and sometimes comical settings. A knife, a pipe, a gun, a grenade, frying pan,  a pot of hot soup,  or an electric eel tank (and so many more!) were all options! 

Warrior of Rome II: a pseudo RTS for the Sega Genesis that had a window interface and strong focus on unit management. Units got stronger and became specialized with experience, so the player needed to track unit progress and plan how to use them to be successful. I have never seen this feature fully re-implemted in any RTS I have played since.

Populous The Begining:  A 3D sequel to the original Populous with deformable terrain and a novel, intuitive order & message queue, way back in 1998! 

So, tell me what other forgotten (or soon to be forgotten) games that are out there that were so innovative that few people realize what they witnessed?

gaming,I wanna apologize to the entire gaming community for doubting that EA sucks.,"
All these years I've seen a plethora of posts, videos etc. online, either serious or humorous ones, about EA being greedy as hell while putting the lowest effort possible. I always thought that people were just being overdramatic or said all that so they can make their joke. But yesterday I realized that behind all the memes, articles there was truth to be found. And they weren't just true, they were VERY true.

I had bought Mass Effect Legendary Edition during the Steam Summer Sale for 6€, installed it, but didn't try it until yesterday (the same thing I do with most of my Steam games to be honest). The second I clicked ""play"" and realized I was being directed to the EA app, I didn't particularly like it but I didn't think much of it. I started to think much of it when my game turned out be unplayable though.

It just said ""preparing game"" on the EA app for a while and then shut down. No big deal, I'll just close Steam and the EA app and try again. Didn't work. Tried it many times, it just didn't work. I went ahead and restarted my PC, but it also didn't work. I verified integrity of the game files and there was no problem with them. I then tried to launch the game via the EA app, the same ""preparing game"" and shut down combo. Same thing happened when I tried to launch it directly via the Launcher in the game files.

Now it really started to piss me off. I just wanted to play the game I had already paid for, nothing more but also nothing less. I searched online for possible solutions. I deleted the registries of the game in Registry Editor, it didn't work, I used Task Manager to close any EA related app before launching the game, it didn't work. I went as far as installing the discontinued Origin with a patch called Fuck Off EA App (which I totally relate to) because it makes it actually usable and it doesn't force you to install the EA app as it would normally do. Then, I started the game using the Launcher found in the game files and I finally managed to launch it! But after closing the game I couldn't get it to work anymore, it was a one time thing. I was getting mad, it had been an hour and a half up until that point.

I decided to take a look at EA's forums but they didn't help me at all. Since I was already on EA's website though, I thought ""why not use their support page?"". So after some digging I managed to create a case about my problem (they even made it difficult for me to create a case compared to other game companies' support pages I had used in the past), with little faith in them helping me. After a few minutes, a ""specialist"" replied to me in the most generic way possible, even though I had explained what my problem was. I tried to write back to him but my case had been paused for some reason and it didn't allow me to resume it. When I pressed ""resume"" it redirected me to another page, where I received a notification about my current case, and when I clicked on it, it prompted me to resume the case, and it was just an infinite loop. I still haven't figured out what's wrong with the game.

All in all, 6€ isn't going to put a dent in my wallet. But I paid for Mass Effect and I can't even play it. It isn't even my fault, EA doesn't let me play a game on the platform I used to buy it, and instead they make me use their platform that isn't even half good, it's straight up terrible. That is 100% on them. Likewise, their support page is also really not user friendly. I never had problems with EA before, and other games like NFS Heat, which I own Steam, run properly on the EA app. That's why I always doubted the fact that EA sucks. I spent money and several hours of my life trying to figure out the problem they themselves have caused. I apologize for doubting you all.",2331,0.84,363,DeathNum,2024-11-10 09:10:12,1go2po4

gaming,"I don't understand the whole ""Killer Squad"" criticism The Division got","Back in the day and even nowadays, people had a problem with that you were playing as unsupervised and unrelgulated elite soldiers that didn't have to answer to anybody and that you were just shooting up innocent people.

And maybe it's because I'm a European, but I never understood why anybody would think that, because nothing in the game supports that idea. First of all, we can't kill any civilians, the game simply doesn't allow it.

And secondly, any enemy you see is inherently hostile. It doesn't matter if it are the Cleaners, the LMB, the Rikers, Hyenas, Outcasts, True Sons or local thugs, they all shoot at you without any provocation. There is no instance in the game were you can walk past them peacefully without getting attacked.

And it's also not a case of: ""Oh, these guys are just missunderstood"". No, we actively see thouse groups planting bombs, taking hostages, setting stuff on fire, killing unarmed civilians, laying ambushes and doing all kind of illegal stuff. Especially the Rikers do all kind of fucked up stuff to the remaining police force in the first game.

So no, I don't buy the notion that the Division agents are the bad guys and massacring civilians without repercussion, because we actually do improve the situation for the general population in both games, while everyone else just loots, murders and tortures everyone they see.",8,0.62,11,Nino_Chaosdrache,2024-11-11 14:03:39,1gp1mjo
gaming,I need recommendations for a city builder that's not overly complex and easy to enjoy!,"Good week everybody!

As the title suggests, I'm not very city builder-savvy, but I've been having an itch lately to play one.

The only colony sim/city builder games that I've ever played were Oxygen not Included, which I played only for 30 hours through the years of having it and basically never got really into it, exactly because of its overly complex nature.

The other one is Against the Storm which I actually played for like 70hrs in the span of two weeks and I loved it (nowhere near finishing the tech tree really) but to be honest it didn't scratch the itch for an actual city builder, the roguelike element is to blame here, although very enjoyable in it's own way. I loved the aesthetic and the ambience/music etc. It's also really hard to get back into after dropping because you'd have to scale it back in difficulty settings and it's kinda demoralising?! I dunno.

So basically what I want from the game is for it to be easy enough to understand in order to have fun without spending 100hours in just to get the jist of it. I want it to have either medieval realistic graphics/settings, or cute graphics, I think I don't care for space/futuristic settings or even present day settings as I find those bring me a ""down"" mood, especially the latter.. I also don't care about the warfare aspect of the games, I actually kind don't wanna have it because I believe it comes hand it hand with the game being very complex.

I think I've boiled it down to these options but I'm having trouble deciding really:

* The wandering village: The cute aesthetic is really winning me here and I think it's a very strong contender, it's still in EA but I think it's pretty much finished.
* Timberborn: Now this one's also cute, I believe it to be a bit more complex so I'm not sure.
* Farthest Frontier: This one is probably the hardest/most complex of the bunch, while also being the most traditional city builder, it's also the most expensive right now and it's not on sale.
* Banished: The fact that it is the oldest one throws me off but It's very traditional and it's like the ancestor of FF, graphics are not that bad so I guess it's okay, it's dirt-cheap and I hear it is not very complex so maybe it could be a good way to ease myself into these games if I'm really interested?!
* Kingdoms and Castles: Very cute graphics, medieval setting, I think it may even be the easiest of the bunch so I'm afraid of it being too shallow and getting bored fast?!
* Settlement Survival: I don't know much about it except that the aesthetic is on the cute side and that it is a decent game.

I would love to have you guys tell me what you think is the best of these choices for me. I'm really having trouble deciding here. I don't wanna buy one of these games and end up playing 5 hours and dropping it because of it's overwhelming complexity, but I also would dislike to get only 20-30 hours out of it.

If I don't answer all the comments, I would like to thank anyone who takes the time to reply to me :D

Sonny really didn’t have much of a presence in Vice City, and although he did call and threaten Tommy a few times, he only started acting towards the end of the game.

On the other hand, I really loved Lance, mainly because his betrayal was unexpected and even when he betrayed, Tommy asked Lance whether he set both of them up, to which Lance replies that he only set Tommy up. This shows how much Tommy loved Lance, but because of Lance’s incompetence and impatience, he couldn’t strive to be a leader like Tommy

Similarly in Liberty City Stories, I liked the rivalry between Toni Cipriani and Vincenzo. The main antagonist of LCS is really forgettable (appears in only two missions) whereas Vinnie had much more of an effect than that. ",32,0.7,96,HP_594,2024-11-10 21:41:13,1goj30b

I just sat there thinking ""Oh, and this jump scare will pop up here...and I was right....and then I'll think I'm safe but monster will appe...yup, there he is"".  And this didn't always happen for me.  Historically I've been really bad at predicting what would happen next in a game/movie/show.  I remember constantly being surprised by things in games growing up but now I feel a really big lack of originality in what I play.  There are exceptions over the last 5 years for me (What Happened To Edith Finch, Persona 5, Final Fantasy Remake, HZD) but I can't count how many games I've installed, played 30 minutes of and then just walked away.  I remember visceral feelings from running through Link To The Past, Gears of War 1 and Arkham Knight.  I miss that.

Astro Bot unthawed my frozen heart and brought back all the joy I experienced playing lighthearted platformers when I was a kid.

Silent Hill 2 Remake and Alan Wake 2 (I know, a 2023 release but I waited for the physical release) gave me some of the most experiences I’ve ever seen in gaming.

gaming,I don't finish games anymore.,"I'm just curious if others have found themselves in my situation. I don't care to beat the final boss/level/mission of any game I play now. My last three games where Mario Wonder, Sekiro, Black Myth: Wukong. I have deeply enjoyed all of these games but I have found my enthusiasm plummet when I reach the final part of the game....to the point that I have no interest in finishing them.

I think this occurs for several reasons. 

1. I know the game will end so the discovery aspect of the game is now gone and that is a major motivator for me.

2. I'm sick of the arbitrarily hard ending to games. Why? What value does it give a game to make the ending much harder than the rest of the game? 

3. I know I'm wasting my time putting extra hours into the game when I can just move on to a new game.

I would like your feedback on 34inch monitor, do you have any regret, did you come back to smaller screens, or is it only pros ?

gaming,How has the Pokemon Company not released a Pokemon Autobattler yet?,"For those who don't know, an Autobattler is a genre of game where you place units on a battlefield and they fight for you. The mechanics involve picking up multiple copies of the same unit, which combine to upgrade the unit's stats and ability. Units also have tags, and making your team out of units with the same tags gives them extra stats, unique abilities, or special interactions. It started out with Dota Auto Chess, then League of Legends made their own version with the very popular Team Fight Tactics, and now there are many more games in that genre, like Mechabellum and games like Backpack Battles can also be considered an Autobattler.

The gameplay loop and mechanics just scream Pokemon to me. You collect multiple copies of a Pokemon to evolve them into their next stage. And you could create a team of all grass types to get the grass bonus, fire types to get fire, etc. As many Pokemon have multiple types, this easily allows a team to have the capability to switch in different directions as needed. Throw in the Type Advantages and Weaknesses and you'd have a very an easy to play game with reasonably deep mechanics. With the breadth of the Pokemon roster, they could easily keep the game fresh by combining different Regions for each season.

And it's not like Pokemon can't make games outside of their ""traditional"" game structure, Pokemon Unite is their attempt to enter the Moba space, they could definitely do the same for a Pokemon Autobattler. In fact, I'd argue that the Autobattler structure fits Pokemon far more than a Moba one does.

I was playing TFT today and it just hit me how much the mechanics fit into the Pokemon structure. Has anyone heard any rumors of this being made or am I alone in thinking it would be a perfect fit?",0,0.35,20,swampyman2000,2024-11-10 12:31:02,1go7b26

Recently I decided to give the game another go. I'm enjoying it a bit more, yes I still have frustrations and criticism with parkour, responsiveness & fluidity, but it seems improved. I want to see the main story through.

Every time in combat I parry & it's the same thing, the enemy is stunned and a icon for a button press to ""kill"" comes on, using R1. It's the same loop & same animation! I have seen videos of various combat finishers that have variety & far more satisfying,  how the hell do I pull this off?
It's very mundane & frustrating, I avoid combat specifically as to not get annoyed.
Every other AC game has had various finisher animations that were satisfying & no problem, it just happens. They were extremely varied & satisfying. 

Side note, any advice if I should change my controller mapping & if so please share.

Final thing, obviously parkour & many other things could be far better & deeper in this game, but why did Ubisoft decide against mixing & matching gear pieces, sets for body parts!?

I am currently wondering wether or not to buy a oled gaming screen. I see everywhere that the image is incredible, but i only see them displayed in brightly lit stores, so the différence seems minimal to me. 

I would go for a 27inch screen, its what i have now and i feel that more would be too big as i play on a desk

What do you think ? I have the budget for it but it doesnt mean i want to uselessly waste money. For those of you that bought one, dud you regret it or cant you even imagine going back ?

Thanks !

Edit : thanks for your answers ! I am not going to change my screen for a 27inch oled,  but i am now thinking about switching for a bigger oled screen (the 34 alienware looks great!)

gaming,11 years later were we to hard on Mario 3D world or nah? ,"
New Nintendo  consoles means a new 3D mario ganes so we were all excited when the WiiU was launched to see where Mario would go after the Galaxy Games and then Nintendo at E3 announces the new Mario game is 3D world and fans were livid, it didn't look to be a brand new experience but rather an extension of 3D Land on 3DS a couple years earlier.

But about a year ago I picked up a Switch and eventually got around to playing the rerelease  and actually  it's pretty good. It has the Nintendo charm of course and I think it works well almost an extension of the Super Mario 2D games. 

I think now that we have a proper Galaxy sequel in Odyseey it's easy to appreciate it, but the question remains was it overhated in the first place. I would actually argue, no that while it's a great game WiiU owners were right to expect something more. Many Nintendo fans complain about the name and the lack of third party support that killed the WiiU, but I would say it was the lack of any titles that really ""popped off"" to get non Nintendo fans interested. 3D World IMO was the right game at the wring time?

But what do you all think?
