ChangeMyView,"CMV: Goodhearted ""cultural appropriation"" is flattering and should not be frowned upon.","I am Austrian and when non-Austrians find a liking in our culture and lets say find Schnitzel tasty and cook it or offer it in their restaurants or want to wear Lederhosen I am not offended at all, quite to the contrary.

Same with Americans: I bet most Americans wouldn't even think about being insulted by Europeans for ""appropriating"" Halloween.

I'd argue this is the normal healthy way cultural exchange goes. One perceives another culture and takes the things one likes and incorporates them into ones own culture. As long as there is no mocking or otherwise negative intent I truly see no issue.

ChangeMyView,CMV: The best way to tax corporations would be to base the tax rate on the CEO to Median Worker ratio. ,"The boiling frog in the US is the middle class. A few stats for context:

In 1972, towards the end of the New Deal era, 61% of households were considered middle class. By 2023, that dropped to 51%.

In 1972, 70% of households were single-income households. By 2023, that had dropped to 34.7%.

That means with 35.3% more households having a dual income in 2023, we still have 10% fewer households in the middle class than we did in 1972.

Lots of things changed in the 1970's but this is objectively moving in the wrong direction. The GDP started skyrocketing, meaning companies were making way more money, It was supposed to trickle down... I don't think even conservatives would defend that claim today.

One more thing that changed over time is that in 1972, the CEO-to-worker compensation ration was 23:1. By 2023, that was 290:1.

I don't see a path where the government could pass legislation that dictates corporate pay structures. I also don't see a path where unions will be as relevant in the future as they were in the past. However, I do see a path forward on the tax code that could help get some of that money back into the hands of workers and expand the middle class.

So, don't focus to much on the numbers, but rather the concept. The current Federal corporate tax rate is 21%. We could move to something like this inclusive of all compensation (salary, bonus, stock, commission):

|C2W Tax Ratio|Corporate Tax Rate|
|:-|:-|
|200+ to 1|40%|
|100+199 to 1|30%|
|50-99 to 1|20%|

ChangeMyView,CMV: Spanking isn’t a good form of discipline for children ,"Physically beating a child is not a good way to teach them manners and respect. When you physically assault a child to get them to behave, that just makes them afraid of you. It doesn’t teach them to respect others, why they should follow the rules, how to behave etc. It can also be very harmful to the child’s development and increase their chances of mental illness when they’re older. Harvard has done a study on this. 

https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/usable-knowledge/21/04/effect-spanking-brain

Children who were spanked as children are also likely to be more violent. 

https://www.utmb.edu/impact/home/2018/01/25/children-who-get-spanked-more-likely-to-be-violent-toward-future-dating-partners

https://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/04/spanking

Being taught that physical violence is the answer at a young age will really shape how you view it in the future. It seems like most parents who still use spanking are only doing it because they don’t have the patience for other forms of discipline. 

I’m open to seeing other views and maybe having my view changed when presented with other evidence

And then we find a ledger in which he meticulously documented payments. All his payments that weren’t just normal groceries. Things like mortgage payments, debt, people who owed him money. A recurring cash payment that amounted to $250,000 over the course of about five years was completely unexplained. We have ruled out it being every conceivable regular person payment. We looked into his bank transactions and they were all cash withdrawals from his bank so untraceable. 

I low-key think my grandfather was mixed up in some shady shit. Nobody has any clue what this was. No name, no address, no purpose given in his ledger. $250,000 for no discernible reason over several years.

offmychest,We have persistent scammers preying on this community,"Folks, a reminder that [Rule 3](/r/offmychest/about/rules) focuses this community's scope on providing emotional support only. We do not allow solicitation or material offers.

This means OPs cannot hint at or ask for money, and community members cannot offer money or food. There are local services that can verify and address a person's situation better than any of us can (and many services will not turn people away if they are asking for it). A kind community member offered a scammer a job and that is okay.

This community is read by millions of people, and scammers around the world know this. We have cultivated an empathic community so we know it can be hard to resist offering material help. It takes only one person to make it worth it because it costs nothing to post. That is why the rules are strictly enforced.

There are many signs of a scammer. They will present a financially desperate situation often with a highly emotional component. They are likely to mention payment services. They may have payment services in their Reddit profile and ask people to look at their profile. They will ask people to privately message them. All of these behaviors may be obfuscated with weird spacing and other ways to evade detection. If they evade detection it's up to the community to report it. Do not call out OPs, report only.

offmychest,my bf ignored my safeword during sex (update),"i accidentally deleted my previous post when i was trying to edit it SORRY 😭😭 this would probably be my last update as i'm considering taking a break from the relationship or calling it off entirely 

please refer to my previous post on the whole situation 

TL;DR: my bf (23m) ignored my (19f) safe word during sex, kept doing his thing and told me the safe word turned him on

(previous update) i met up with my boyfriend yesterday and asked him if we could have a serious conversation about what happened that night. he thought i was joking until he realised i was serious. i told him about how i felt violated and unsafe when he ignored my safe word. 

during the conversation, i had my phone in my hand and put my friend on speed dial, just in case the situations escalates and i need to leave. he wanted to hold my hand, but i was caught off guard and flinched, thinking he was trying to snatch my phone away from me. he noticed, and went quiet before asking if i really thought of him as a dangerous person. he broke down crying and started apologising to me again and agajn. he said he never intended to hurt me that way. he ended up leaving, and i was alone at his place. his friend called me later and told me that hes with him at a shooting range. i updated my friend on this and she thought itd be best for me to wait for him to come back after hes calmed down and talk it out.

a few hours later, he came back. he reeked of alcohol so i knew he was drunk. he was talking gibberish and i couldnt understand what he was trying to say. i told him that id talk to him when hes sober but he insisted that he wants to keep talking to me. he started apologising over and over and said that he thought the consent was mutual and that id be into it too because of his kinks ive tried in the past with him. and that i was only using the safe word to lead him on. i reiterated that the only thing i agreed to was vanilla sex and we'd never discussed the cnc thing prior. but at that point he was so drunk he ended up passing out on the couch. 

i planned on staying to take care of him but i ended up leaving. i took our cat, his spare keys to my dorm room and had my friend pick me up from his place. he woke up a few hours later and tried to call me (can't attach the image but you get the idea) i told him i'd only talk to him when he's ready for an actual conversation where he doesn't just walk off.

he showed up to my dorm today and asked if we could talk. and my dumbass agreed :/ so we went to a park on my campus (with a lot of people around) to talk. the conversation got quite intense and he said i wasn't hearing him out. then he slapped me on the face. i guess he realised what he just did because he immediately start to apologise repeatedly but at this point i couldn't bear to be with him so i just got up and left.

After that, for the next 4 years we never saw him. The only time he and my parents talked were when they called him asking about his relationship or if he was ready to go back to school. Through every phone call, literally the only thing I heard him say in response to anything was, ""uh huh"" or ""idk"".

In september this year, while my parents and I were eating dinner, our doorbell rang. It was my brother. He handed my parents an envelope and left without saying a word. Inside was a copy of his degree certificate and a note, or atleast im assuming he got a second copy. The note read, ""Yes, I am going to have children with her but you wont be their grandparents.

They tried calling him but he changed his number and I think hes gone for good now.

This is also a good way to save some money if you can find a better deal for insurance elsewhere or if you find yourself overinsured in some specific area.

## Why insurance?

Insurance is an approach to handle the problem of *risk*. Most likely, during your life, one or more of these things will happen: you will be in a vehicle accident, you or someone close to you will experience serious illness or injury, or you will lose your job. Positive events have associated risk as well: ask anyone who has had a child, puppy, house, or marriage.

You can choose to *retain* each of those risks: decide that if the bad thing happens, you can afford to pay for it, to self-insure. For example, if you lose a laptop, you can buy another one. You can also *reduce* the risk, say, by not driving on icy streets or by having chains on your tires.  The other ways to deal with risk are to *avoid* it (don't buy a puppy) or *transfer* it (insurance!).

Most of us don’t think about risk until the bad thing happens. We are in a vehicle crash with an expensive car, someone is injured, and only then it dawns on us that we might be underinsured.

For many major risks, most people share the risk with an insurance company through various insurance products. If you own a vehicle, most likely you will be required by your state to have liability coverage (personal injuries and property damage caused by you). If you have a mortgage, your mortgage holder will require you to have homeowners insurance and some landlords will require renters insurance. Other types of insurance are optional, but may be desirable if available, for example, disability insurance.

## Audit your insurance coverage

Take a minute to think about what insurance coverage you currently have, whether you may be paying too much, and whether your coverage limits are appropriate:

* Car Insurance
* Health / Vision / Dental Insurance
* Life Insurance
* Homeowners / Renters Insurance
* Jewelry Insurance

Although insurance is an important financial tool to protect you against emergencies, it can also be a major drain on your budget. Insurance agents often use the fact that *some* insurance is important to make you feel that *the more insurance you have, the better off you are*.

It's wise to **only insure what you need to insure**. What do you need to insure? Anything that you could not easily afford to replace with your cash savings or where the loss would significantly set you back financially. In the next 30 days, review not only the types of insurance you have, but the level of coverage you have in each type. Here are some ideas for various types of insurance:

## Car Insurance

Assess all the types of coverage you have on your car. See the wiki article on [car insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/carinsurance) for more details and ways to save money. For example, if you drive less than 10,000 miles per year, call your insurance company and see if they provide a low-mileage discount.

Liability insurance is required by law if you drive and is very important: Would you be able to pay out a $300,000 lawsuit if you injure someone in a car accident? Liability insurance is not a great place to skimp.

Coverages for ""uninsured motorists"" (an uninsured or underinsured driver injures you or your passengers) and ""medical payments"" (you or your passengers are injured in an auto accident) are also worth having. They are less expensive than liability coverage and the irresponsibility of others is a major risk.

Also consider whether your ""collision"" and ""comprehensive"" deductibles coverage is appropriate or necessary, especially if you have an older car or significant savings. Eliminating or reducing these types of coverage can reduce your insurance bill, but you'll be left on the hook to replace or repair your own car if you (or mother nature) damage it.

Finally, when you see car insurance advertisements selling you ""better car replacement"" or ""one model year newer"" insurance, realize that this is a **great** deal for the insurer and not as great for their customers. Buying these policies mean that you're paying for a piece of a newer car every single month even though the odds of taking advantage of these policies are relatively low.

## Health / Vision / Dental Insurance

In the U.S., some form of catastrophic health insurance is vital for nearly everyone, as a week in an intensive care unit is enough to bankrupt all but the wealthiest. However, consider your expected use of healthcare services. If you are young and healthy, you may not need to fork over the extra dough for a *Gold* plan with lots of coverage. See the wiki article on [health insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health_insurance) for more details.

## Life Insurance

Remember the principle of insurance? ""Only insure what you couldn't afford to lose."" If you have children or a spouse that would be unable to maintain their standard of living without your income, *then you may need to insure your earning ability*. That means you take out a term life insurance policy that pays your spouse and/or dependents in the event that you die and can no longer earn money to provide for them. However, if you **don't** have dependents or if your spouse can earn enough money on their own to provide for themselves, you might not need life insurance at all.

It's also important for you to understand that there are two basic kinds of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance (like whole life or universal life). With term life insurance, you pay to cover your loved ones from the risk of your death. With whole life insurance, a portion of your cost goes to coverage, but it also has a cash value component that grows over time similar to an investment account.

While there may be some exceptions for the very wealthy, term life insurance tends to be the best choice for the vast majority of individuals.

Read our wiki article on [life insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/insurance) for a deeper discussion.

## Homeowners / Renters Insurance

Insurance on your residence is important for almost everyone who owns or rents a home. Owning a house without insurance could be disastrous if it burnt down, because you likely have a mortgage on it and probably don't have $250k cash to replace it. However, it may be worth checking how large your [deductible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductible) is. If it's only $1,500, you might be able to afford more than *that* in an emergency. If appropriate, you can increase your deductible to reduce your costs. Note that homeowners deductibles are per incident, though. See the wiki article on [homeowners insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/homeowners_insurance) for more details.

Renters insurance policies also tend to be very cheap (roughly $15 per month for $30,000 of property coverage and $100,000 of liability coverage).

Finally, make sure you have an up-to-date inventory of your property so any claims will be easier to make. An easy way to do this is taking a video on your phone as you walk through your home, naming everything as you walk through. Note the make and models of anything expensive like electronics. (Make an offsite or cloud copy of the video too!)

## Jewelry Insurance

Most single-issue insurance policies tend to be [poor deals for consumers](http://clark.com/insurance/insurance-you-can-stop-buying/). Opinions vary on jewelry insurance, but the default assumption of most people is to carry insurance on an engagement ring is more a product of the jewelry marketing machine than actual need. A few factors make jewelry insurance less necessary than other types of insurance:

* Your homeowners or renters insurance may already cover jewelry up to a certain value. Check!
* You should not even be buying jewelry that you couldn't afford to replace with cash.
* Most jewelry insurance does not cover accidental loss or misplacement. Only theft or damage. 
* Consider your (and your SO's) sentimental attachment to the piece. If your wife's engagement ring were stolen or lost, could you replace it with cash savings? Would you have a conversation about the importance of replacing it identically or go for a less expensive piece?

## Another way to save money

One thing to consider when reviewing your coverage is that sometimes companies offer discounts for having multiple accounts with them (e.g., a multi-policy discount or ""bundling""). When you call your insurance company, ask them about these discounts. For some insurers like USAA, you can even get a discount for adding non-insurance accounts like a savings account.

## A note on emergency funds

Following [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics), an emergency fund of cash equal to 3 to 6 months' worth of routine expenses is recommended. If you have no collision coverage on your car and rely on it to get to work, and/or a very high deductible on your home insurance ($10k), seriously consider the size of your emergency fund, and whether it is enough to get you through a ""double-whammy"" such as job loss and a car accident at the same time.

## Notes on other types of insurance

The bare minimum for most people is car insurance (if they drive), health insurance, term life insurance (if others depend on their income), and homeowners/renters insurance.  However, there are several additional types of insurance that some people may want to consider.  In particular:

- **Umbrella Insurance**: If your net worth exceeds the coverage limits for your car insurance liability or homeowners/renters liability (or your profession has high earning potential), you should evaluate whether umbrella insurance is appropriate for your situation.  Read more about [umbrella insurance in our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/umbrella_insurance) if this applies to you.
- **Long-Term Care Insurance**: If you're in your 50s (some financial advisors advise late 40s), you may want to start considering [whether LTC insurance makes sense for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/ltc_and_disability_insurance).
- **Disability Insurance**: Depending on your situation, [you may want to consider disability insurance as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/ltc_and_disability_insurance).

# Challenge success criteria

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done two or more of the following things:

* Reviewed the coverage limits on each of your policies and read the associated wiki page.  (Making changes is up to you and not something you should do without doing more research and reading.  This challenge is only about reviewing your insurance.)
* Read more about a type of insurance that you don't currently have.
* Created an up-to-date home inventory of your belongings.
* Requested a quote from a different insurance company or inquired about potential discounts from your current insurance company.
* Read the policy document for at least one of your insurance policies (you should know which ""perils"" the insurance company covers and which are excluded).

personalfinance,I disputed a charge with Wells Fargo and got denied.,"I got approved for a Wells Fargo credit card back in September, but I never received the card in the mail. Then, I noticed in my Wells Fargo app that there was a $400 purchase at Home Depot in a town I’ve never been to. I called Wells Fargo to report this, and they refunded the amount and sent me a new card with a new number.

However, I recently saw that the $400 charge has been added back to my account. I called Wells Fargo again to figure out what’s going on. Their fraud department informed me that the original card was activated using my phone number, so the charge was reinstated. (I never activated the original card since I never received it, and I have no idea how this could have happened.)

I also called the Home Depot where the purchase occurred and spoke with someone there. They told me the $400 purchase was for gift cards. They even sent me a photo of paperwork showing that whoever made the purchase had tried to use two other cards first, both of which were declined, before successfully using my card.

Wells Fargo said they would get back to me within 48 hours. However, they seem to think I made the purchase since the card was activated using my phone number. Lately, I’ve been receiving strange spam calls and texts, which I don’t respond to, but I’m worried this might be connected.

I’m concerned that I won’t get the $400 refunded. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!


UPDATE #1: sorry i didn’t mean to put dispute. This was reported as fraud but was ultimately denied and i was still charged $400. I’m gonna do most of what everyone has suggested in the comments. I think what may work most in my favor is that i have phone records showing that i did not make the call when the card was apparently activated by my phone number. This probably means that my number was spoofed(?). 

Please don’t make the same mistake i made and bank with WF. I appreciate everyone’s help in this thread. You’re all great! I hope to provide a positive update soon.",302,0.9,150,OldDirtMcGirt,2024-11-15 08:10:03,1grx6mv
personalfinance,Dad 72 no savings and $16k in credit card debt. He has to quit work due to his back and I’m scared for him. What are his options? Finding wfh,"Rent, $1400
Bills ~ $3500
Income $70k. Was laid off a few months ago and will owe money on taxes. Has also not done his taxes in 2 years. 

It’s unfortunately more complicated since he also has a wife with severe Alzheimer’s. She honestly needs to enter a memory care facility but it’s $6,000/month. Her family might help but not clear. He’s currently paying an in-home caregiver $25 an hour when he makes $33 an hour. Not a great situation. 

He has been a career restaurant general manager. He can’t do 9 hour shifts on his feet anymore. He has social security but it’s not enough to keep his apartment.

What are some options? Unclear on exact amount of debt but somewhere I want to guess around 20k. Credit cards are maxed out. 

Trying to find a work from home job for him but not sure where to start since he’s only done restaurant work for 50+ years",23,0.87,31,razorbite,2024-11-15 15:54:31,1gs7tha

personalfinance,Gym is threatening to send me to collections - I never signed a contract!!,"This is messy. 

A couple weeks ago, I went to a fancy gym for a free intro class. They required that I put a credit card on file before the class (in my experience at other nice gyms this is standard). 

I took the class and left. The sales associate started texting me offers and asking me to join. Via text, I said I was interested in joining. Via text, he briefly went over the cost and asked if he could email me a contract that I could sign electronically, and I said okay. 

At that point, I stopped responding to them. I was super busy, and I knew their expensive gym didn't really fit into my budget. I DID NOT SIGN THE CONTRACT, AND DID NOT COMMUNICATE WITH THEM FURTHER AFTER IT WAS SENT. I have not set foot in the gym since the introduction class which was over a week ago. 

Then, I checked my credit card statement, and saw that they had charged me $250! ($175 monthly dues plus $75 joining fee). 

I figured there must be a mistake, and I called and spoke with the manager/ owner. ""No mistake,"" he said, ""the written contract was just a formality; you already entered into the contract with your texts."" He emailed me screen shots of the texts; the text where I said ""okay,"" in response to them stating the monthly cost and asking if they could email me the contract, and the text where I said I was interested in joining (which was sent BEFORE they sent me the contract). 

I insisted that they reverse the charges and cancel my monthly membership, and threatened other actions (BBB, attorney generals office, small claims). He laughed and insisted that he would win any of those disputes, saying that in Missouri texts are considered legally binding. He also refused to process my cancelation at that time, saying that, per the contract (which I'd never signed), it requires 30 days notice, so I would still owe the next monthly charge scheduled for 28 days from then. Furthermore, he said in order to cancel I have to cancel through their website; when you try to cancel on the website it makes you click on a box acknowledging that you agree to their 30 day cancellation policy and agree to be charged your monthly fee one more time before the cancelation is final, and, since I've never agreed to that previously, I did not want to click and agree to it now. 

I called my credit card and disputed the charges, which they reversed. 

Now I'm receiving emails from the gym owner threatening to send my account to collections! I have great credit and I'm super worried about what this could do. I never signed the contract nor did I explicitly agree to any of the contract terms in our texts, but clearly this gym owner thinks my texts are good enough to charge me hundreds of dollars.  He is also refusing to cancel my membership (with or without the 30 days notice). 

I did file a dispute with the states attorney general and the BBB, but I don't know how I can prevent it from going to collections, unless I take them to small claims. I feel like a lawyer is going to cost a lot - possibly more than I stand to gain - but I think if I don't have one, I may not win the case. 

Any advice? ",143,0.9,68,EpicAnonymous,2024-11-14 22:52:27,1groopl
personalfinance,John Hancock told me I can't transfer my 401k due to a non-compete clause.,"I know very little about finance so bear with me. I worked under a union in the US long enough for my John Hancock 401k to vest. In 2023 I left the union, and worked as a salaried employee for an electrical contractor (non-unionized) and they had their own 401k with Principal (also now vested). I called JH and asked about transferring my JH 401k to my Principal one, and was told I cannot roll over the account due to a non-compete clause. Basically because my Principal 401k is also under the Electrical umbrella, they won't allow me to transfer it. Does that sound right?",308,0.88,54,MysteriousApricot891,2024-11-14 11:00:56,1gr9gpc

AskScience,AskScience Panel of Scientists XXVI,"**Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/198hzvn/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxv/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

>>>>>>> Stashed changes

Right before I finished the draft (or manuscript, which seems to be the term being used), I started to actually research the market expectations regarding debut novels. 

I only just found out that the expectation for a debut is around 60,000 to 100,000 words for a standalone, and that 120,000 words is considered too long.

I crumpled to dust then and there, less due to the massive task of rewrites and revisions that was my immediate future— that I was ready for— but more due to the realization that I have wasted two years of my life working on scenes that are basically useless. I’ve already cried. I’ve already spent the past couple of days looking at the mirror and calling myself an idiot. I did that both in real life and in my dreams, by the way. We’re not even supposed to be able to control our dreams, but somehow I still did it while deep in slumberland, which I believe illustrates just how devastated I feel.

I do have a plan already— condense, cut, rewrite, revise. I have whole arcs that I would cut, whole storylines that’s vanishing in the void forever, and if I were to be honest I actually feel relieved they won’t see the light of day. I have a plan, which is the one thing that anchors my sanity from spiraling deep into the near-inescapable void of self-pity.

I guess I just wasn’t expecting to face the reality of the utter uselessness of my efforts this way. 

Three hundred seventy five thousand words. What was I *thinking?* What kind of blind delusion was this?

I’ll take a break. A week; hopefully that’s enough to clear my head. Then— I’ll write again.

Fighting! Aja! *Insert all the fighting chants here!* 



I thought I'd share it here, where I've lurked for the past week. I haven't found anyone making a direct post on ""writing too much"", if my terrible error can even be called that. I don't know if this is going to be helpful to anyone. I guess I hope that whenever you feel disillusioned about missed goals, or if a scene isn't going the way you want it to, or you feel like you're writing too little, or maybe a character just isn't letting themselves be written right and you feel like tearing through the land of words and throttling them with your own bare hands— well, at least you can say that you're not the idiot who didn't do her research and wrote 375,000 words!

Advice,Just found out my daughters best friends dad is a sex offender,"So I (31F) don’t want to go into to much details for brevity sake. But my daughter is 9 and we found out last night from ccap that her best friends dad is a sex offender, he slept with a 15 year old when he was a soccer coach, 27 at the time. And I just want advice on what to tell her about why she can’t go over to their house anymore. Nothing has happened to her by the way she’s been briefed on things to watch out for and tell us numerous times and we’ve asked her since finding out this information. I obviously can’t tell her what happened and why but she spends every day she can with this friend and she isn’t going to be distracted or dissuaded with vague answers for long.

EDIT: I forgot to mention he also has a domestic violence charge from this year that makes me quite uncomfortable.

Edit 2: so as of now my plan is to make my home more inviting and take the girls out to parks and things more often to get them to want to come to our place more often, me and my husband have decided we are not giving her details to protect their friendship and her friends reputation at school because I can’t guarantee she won’t say anything to her friends about this. I’m still unsure about what I’m actually going to say, but a discussion is planned with the girls mother who is divorced from her father and we will go from there after we have that discussion. As of tonight we are taking the girls bowling and I will update further if anything of note happens I suppose. And for rude commenters I’m just ignoring those I don’t care.",1074,0.93,440,Subby_luv,2024-11-15 12:56:50,1gs3rfe
Advice,Girlfriend [27F] told the nurse that she’s never loved me [29M] while on heavy painkillers after surgery ,"I’ve been with my girlfriend for 5 years we live together and have a dog too. She recently underwent her first surgery for Colitis / Crohn’s disease. 

While recovering after the surgery she was given some sort of heavy IV painkiller that makes her loopy and as I was ironically on Reddit just outside the room I overheard heard the nurse ask her “where’s your boyfriend today” to which she responded “no clue, I’ve never loved him anyway”. 

Now I’m second guessing everything and reading into her acting distant recently or if it’s all in my head.

Advice,"I come from a culture where if a girl is born, they say it's a loss item","I have been good in studies since childhood.  Moved abroad in 2021 for higher studies with scholarships. Did not take any help from my family back home. 

My father always asked me for money these past years. As I was a student and working part-time,  I used to send him money every few months.  They never asked how I was doing emotionally and financially surviving alone on my own with no savings.  Whenever I had money saved I sent it to them because they were always making me feel guilty. 

3 years later, I graduated,  got a job with 62k a year, got married having a baby. My family did not express any happiness or excitement.  Two week after my marriage,  my father said you have to send us a fixed monthly allowance . it Shocked me because they never asked if i am having a boy or girl, how's my health etc. Instead they just care about money. (I have already sent them around 5k dollars since last 3 year). 

The guilt trip they send me to is that they paid for living/education expenses till my undergrad. (I always had scholarships and also was never a overspender,  never had any luxury).

Meanwhile,  my father used his life savings for my only brother (34m) to go to Hungary to do higher studies! And my father said as I sent him with my money you have to give us monthly money. 

I have been doing that sending dollars every month which I could use for my own family expenses.  My husband is a great person, I feel bad for not being able to help him properly with expenses.  I cut off all the contacts with my family. They were always abusive towards me, wanted to marry me off at 19 so that they don't have to pay for my expenses.  

I don't know what to do. I cannot accept the fact that my family is like that. I feel sad and alone. I don't have anyone except my husband and his family.

Advice,Recently found out my older brother is a serial rapist (never been convicted),"So, his entire life, he’s never been in a relationship longer than a couple months and it’s always been so annoying. He acts like every girl he’s with is “the one” he wants to settle down with, yet cheats on every one of them. He plays “dad” with all the moms he gets with and it’s so weird because those relationships have never lasted. 

Well I recently found out (my mom already knew all of this and never told me which kinda pisses me off a bit as I have a daughter of my own) that he has assaulted several girls. One of them was only 14-15 years old and he was 21 at the time. He had gotten her so drunk that she started having seizures and assaulted her in the middle of one…problem is, none of these girls have ever felt comfortable going to the police with this as he ALWAYS gets away with everything and he’s friends with the police. 

I found all of this out the day after I allowed him to spend the night on my couch, when my daughter was sleeping in her own room. Nothing happened to her but I feel so disgusted knowing something *could* have. What makes me even more mad, is that everyone in our family acts as if he’s never done these things, and plays along with all his new relationships. He is currently with a mom of a very young girl and I worry for them. 

I’ve cut him off and don’t let him around my daughter anymore. But I’m expecting twin girls very soon and I know he’s going to be at all the family gatherings and holidays and I just don’t want to even associate with him. But my daughter is very close with the rest of our family and I don’t want her to miss any of the holidays and time with them. My husband thinks I should let it go since he’s going to be around either way, but I don’t want my daughters to even know him. ",52,1.0,32,Elyciaaa,2024-11-15 10:30:41,1gs0au4

Advice,"After 3.5 years, I want to stop babysitting my 2 grandchildren under the age of 4. I am 61 years old (retired) and I’ve been babysitting for free. ","Edit:
* THANKS TO EVERYONE WHO REPLIED. A deadline has been given and it's before 2025.
* I never volunteered to babysit. I was told I would be babsitting. I didn't want my infant grandbabies watched by strangers, so I agreed. 
* I never had help from my parents, so I tried to do better for my daughter.
* I am retired, but that doesn't mean I have nothing to do in my life. I am active and very social which makes the commitment each week especially inconvenient. 
* Babysitting keeps me from the gym, cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, gardening and many other personal tasks.
* I bought a beach condo when I retired in 2020. I have not stayed there more than 4 days because I have to babysit. In May I told my daughter and SIL I wanted to stop babysitting and stay at the ocean for the summer. That never happened. They ignored me, but I am guilty for allowing them to do that.
* They are not generous on holidays / birthdays. They spend $150 or less on me. It's not that I need lavish gifts, but their actions make me feel underappreciated and undervalued. 
* Now they suggested I get paid. I don't want a job. My freedom is more valuable than their money. 
* I know this will impact the relationship I have with my granchildren, but I am willing to accept that change in return to being a GM on my terms. 
* They have the money to spend on childcare. I refuse to feel guilty about forcing them to use that route. I was a working parent. I found my way and now they have to find theirs. 
* I hope this thread helps other grandparents set healthy boundaries. 

I am a 61 YO grandmother who babysits 2 days a week for my daughter and SIL. It's been 3.5 years. I do not get paid. I clean, make meals, give baths etc. and stay for 8 - 12 hours a day, sometimes longer. I want to stop doing this. I love my grandchildren, but I do not want this commitment anymore. I recently asked for gas money because I am spending about $100 a month on gas because of the distance I have to travel to their home. They ask me to spend the night, but I never get a break when I do. Both work from home and they make a decent living. They are making me feel guilty. I want to live my life as I choose. I am retired but I am not free to make plans because I have to babysit every week. I want to hear various opinions on my situation. Thanks",1025,0.92,453,Virtual-Box-8890,2024-11-14 14:10:58,1grdzwh
Advice,I think my dad was a pervert ,"I have never told anyone about this. But I just need someone to know and give their opinion.

It started when I was ~6. My dad would help me get dressed after showers. He’d rub in moisturiser and sometimes he’d have showers with me. At this point it didn’t feel weird and I’d enjoy the showers. It used to be fun. He’d hit me a lot back then so idk it was a nice change?

It started feeling weird when I was 9 or 10. He’d insist on rubbing cream on me after showers even though I’d tell him to stop and that I was big enough to do it myself. I think I complained enough that my mum made him stop. 

I have really vague memories but I know that sometimes I’d be masturbating and he’d be there. But idk how those situations arose or what the context was. I used to masturbate a lot as a kid but it used to make me feel sick. I just couldn’t stop idk. 

When I was a teenager he’d cuddle me in the morning. It started off normal - just affectionate hugs. But then he’d start spooning me and wrapping his legs around me. I’d try to wriggle away and push him off but he’d clamp me. Back then I knew that it was weird because I could feel his private and I’d try and avoid it. It was only when I was older, spooning with my 1st bf that I realised I’d been feeling a boner. 

Around 15/16/17 he’d slap my ass a lot. If I was just walking past him, etc. I hated it and would tell him to stop. I think it weirded out my mum too because she made him stop. A few times he’s grabbed my breasts while we were play fighting. I felt really uncomfortable but idk I thought maybe it wasn’t as weird as I was making it out to be. It was never anything more so I really didn’t know what to think. 
 
There are other things that happened and all I can think is…wait that wasn’t appropriate at all. 

He wasn’t a great dad growing up. He was physical, short tempered and just a massive bully. But he’s been trying really hard to support me in my twenties. He’s funds my hobbies and education. He’s not perfect at all but I know he cares. 

I don’t want to think my dad was weird. It’s been easier to pretend it was normal and nothing major. But nowadays I can’t sleep. I’ve struggled with self harm, depression, psychosis, etc. etc. I don’t know how to come to term with things. I feel gross? I love him despite all the awful things he’s put me through. 

Idk I’m a mess, can anyone relate to what I’m going through? ",105,0.96,70,throwaway018384793,2024-11-14 21:32:35,1grnacw
Advice,Girlfriend says she's not in love with me anymore.,"My (36M) gf (32F) and I had been together for nearly 5 years. Things were great and we were amazing together. A couple months ago she mentioned one of her ex's messaged her and they just talked again. Well a few weeks ago I noticed she started texting him alot amd would take her phone with her everywhere. I told her I was concerned about it amd she swore to me they were just talking and told me the things they talked about. I told her i wouldn't be the controlling boyfriend that tells her to stop talking to him but it worried me. Then a few days ago i mention that I finally got her an engagement ring, to which she then says that I should take it back because she loves me but no longer loves me the way she should. I asked her if it was the ex and she swears its not. She said she had these feelings momentarily other times but always ignored it. Her main issue is that we dont go out much. (Which is true, i unfortunately am a home-body so thats on me) I still cant shake the feeling though that her texting her ex may have had something to do with this even though I've never had any reason to doubt her before this. Am i overthinkibg things or do you think she may have been emotionally involved with her ex again? Do i fight to save the relationship or just move on? 


Update: after talking some more we broke it off. I had the ring refunded so no loss there. The house we're living is in her parents name but she doesnt want it so i will be buying it from them (at the price they currently owe on it) . We agreed she and her daughter continue living here till she finds a new place as long as she keeps paying her part of the bills. It sucks, and i feel heartbroken, but i realized that its best to move on for both our sakes. Thanks for all the comments. I genuinely believe she is a good person, even if she did emotionally cheat. I know that sounds stupid, but it takes two to make a relationship work so i gotta take my own blame in this failing. Gonna spend some time working out what i want after this.

LetsNotMeet,Human Trafficking Facts and Stats,"Hi, everyone. Due to the nature of this subreddit and because it's a hot button topic on social media in general, we receive a *lot* of posts and comments about encounters being possible human trafficking.



Unfortunately, there is a massive amount of misinformation about what human trafficking is and isn't, and the vast majority of these interactions here in this subreddit and elsewhere on social media are not how trafficking typically occurs.



# **What is human trafficking, anyway?**



Human trafficking is the exploitation ([thanks to u/officialfourloko for pointing this out!](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/16t9o8w/human_trafficking_facts_and_stats/k2ub7cp/)) of people through coercion, deception, force and any combination of those three, for sex, labor, or both. Human trafficking DOES NOT usually occur by spotting some girl alone out and about, following her and kidnapping her or ""tagging"" her to kidnap later. For sex trafficking in particular, the people trafficked almost *always* know and often times love or trust the person that trafficked them. 



Human trafficking is, disgustingly, a business, and it'd be bad for business to grab some random girl that might have a rich family to look for her, and to do so in front of witnesses. While there have been a few cases of trafficking that have occurred that way (it's sensational and scary, or we wouldn't know about it), it is by far the exception and not the rule. You are more likely to be trafficked by a romantic partner than anyone else.


# **How it happens**


""The most pervasive myth about human trafficking is that it often involves kidnapping or physically forcing someone into a situation. In reality, most traffickers use psychological means such as, tricking, defrauding, manipulating or threatening victims into providing commercial sex or exploitative labor. Another myth is that traffickers target victims they don't know. Many survivors have been trafficked by romantic partners, including spouses, and by family members, including parents."" - Polaris Project



""Perpetrators of human trafficking span all racial, ethnic, and gender demographics and are as diverse as survivors. Some use their privilege, wealth, and power as a means of control while others experience the same socio-economic oppression as their victims. They include individuals, business owners, members of a gang or network, parents or family members of victims, intimate partners, owners of farms or restaurants, and powerful corporate executives and government representatives."" - Polaris Project


# **Recent Statistics**


Based on data* from the [2021 National Report](https://humantraffickinghotline.org/en/resources/2021-national-report) by The Human Trafficking Hotline:



* **72% of trafficking is for sex**, 10% is for forced labor, 4% is for both sex and labor, with the remaining 14% being for unspecified purposes.



* 62% of sex trafficking victims are adults, **28% are minors**. In some cases, demographic information is not provided to the hotline, which is why the percentage here doesn't add up to 100%.



* 84% of sex trafficking victims are female, 8% are male, with the remaining 8% having another gender identity, defined as someone who identifies as any identity other than cisgender male or female.



In the vast majority of cases (88%), the country of origin of victims was unknown. When the country of origin *was* known, the majority of victims were US citizens. 



*note: this data is all from substantiated tips received by the hotline from January 1, 2021 until December 31, 2021, most of which came from victims themselves. 


#  **Additional Info & Sources**


For more information, please visit [Polaris Project](https://polarisproject.org/victims-traffickers), a wonderful resource for information about human trafficking and ways to help if you are interested, or [The Human Trafficking Hotline](http://humantraffickinghotline.org/), which keeps one of the most extensive data sets on human trafficking in the United States.



If you believe you or someone you know is a victim of human trafficking, you can also call +18883737888 (open 24/7) to make a report (this is a United States number, if you suspect human trafficking in another country, please refer to your country’s national human trafficking hotline).

LetsNotMeet,What Belongs Here,"I'm getting real sick of people getting shitty over their stories being removed, so here's a list of stories that inarguably belong here. If you read this thread and you have a story, compare it to any of these. If it wouldn't fit in with this list of stories, *it does not belong on this subreddit.* Usually if you're not sure if a story belongs here, it doesn't. 


1. [They stalked all the stay at home moms](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/7bhjfl/they_stalked_all_the_stay_at_home_moms) - I don't think I need to explain why this fits. I know there is some skepticism in the comments, but as OP was interactive with them prior to deleting her account (typically creative writing pieces OP doesn't respond to many, if any, comments), I think it's okay to leave up. 

2. [This happened quite a long time ago yet it is never too far from my mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/gi7emq/this_happened_quite_a_long_time_ago_yet_it_is) - this fits because although OP made it out unharmed and nothing really happened, the insistence of ""coming up here"" and the fact the creeper left *surgical shears* where they are not needed pushes this story into ""out of the ordinary"" 

3. [No good deed goes unpunished](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1g3x4f/no_good_deed_goes_unpunished) - Here is an example of a car story that would actually remain up. It takes place almost entirely in the car, but it is not someone just following her, or road raging and she goes home physically unharmed. This would be terrifying to go through. (Side note: this is also one of my favorite stories of all time as I love it when assholes like this get their due comeuppance) 

4. [I was a victim of sex trafficking](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/p1bmel/i_was_a_victim_of_sex_trafficking) - this is a real story about actual human trafficking. If you ""think"" you escaped human trafficking, most likely you didn't. Human trafficking overwhelmingly does not happen the way most people think it does, the reality is truly insidious and horrifying. 

5. [The office in the middle of nowhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1t2uwq/the_office_in_the_middle_of_nowhere) - I don't think I really need to explain this one either, I just wanted an example for the ""found something creepy/bizarre"" category. 


As a reminder, stories posted in this subreddit should have been life threatening (stories 1 and 3), extremely unusual/uncommon (stories 2 and 4) or about a time when you stumbled upon something excessively creepy (story 5). 


# What does not belong here? 

* You *think* you were followed because somebody was acting weird but you didn't interact much, if at all and eventually they either gave up or you lost them with minimal effort on your part (so didn't have to hide/confront them) 

* You can't say for certain what someone's intentions were, you can only guess at what they were doing or planning. 

* Being harassed/stared at/catcalled. I understand how frightening and enraging this is, but if you're a woman and you live in any moderately sized city or larger, you will have experienced this. It's entirely too common to be worthy of a story here. That doesn't change the fact it's threatening, disgusting, disrespectful behavior, but this subreddit is meant to focus on, again, life-threatening encounters.
 * an additional note here: stories containing excessive detail about your personal appearance will be removed, even if they fit the standards for this sub. It's a harmful belief to perpetuate in multiple directions that only conventionally attractive people get creeped on - anyone can be harassed on the street. Oftentimes what you look like has little, if anything to do with it, it's the loser's complete lack of regard and view of you as a person and (and for women, lack of respect for us) that causes them to harass you. If our appearance mattered that much for it, 11/12 year olds that look very much like children to anyone with an ounce of brain matter would not get catcalled. 

* The encounter didn't happen to you, but happened to your mother, sister, father, friend, aunt, etc. 

I reserve the right to edit this post to add/remove stories as I see fit, as well as adjust formatting. I suppose we could use this post as well for any comments/suggestions for the sub, cuz why not.

LetsNotMeet,Banana Peel + Clock ,"I posted this in a different sub, but I can't get it out of my mind. The more I consider it, the more certain I am that someone, most likely my creepy maintenance guy, entered my apartment in a very unconventional way.

This happened  close to ten years ago. Daylight savings time reminder me of a very strange incident.

My husband, baby daughter, and I lived together in a small apartment. We had a clock on the wall in our living room that we never adjusted for daylight savings time. It had been an hour off for months. It was out of reach, and we were really busy.  Rather than changing it, we just joked about it all the time. We rarely relied on the analog clock anyway. Plus, eventually it would be correct again!

One day, I got home from a morning outing with my daughter, and I noticed that a banana peel was in the hall on the floor. It had been stepped on. This was very strange because we did not have any bananas in our house. In fact, we never did. None of us ever ate them. I was quite startled. 

I sent a text to my husband, and asked him if he stopped by home during his shift and possibly dropped a banana peel on the floor. He said he most certainly had not. We checked our camera footage, and no one had come into our apartment. I cleaned the banana up off the carpet. 

I packed a diaper bag for my daughter, so we could leave for the afternoon. Before we walked out the door, I glanced at our clock. The time was correct. It had been adjusted for the time change. I was startled. I checked my phone to be certain.  Sure enough, the clock had been adjusted. I grabbed my daughter and our bag, and we left. Once we got safely to the car, I messaged my husband to ask if he had adjusted the clock. He had not. 

When we got home that evening, my husband thought I had been joking with him. I still can't explain what happened. My husband is not a practical joker, and this would be a very weird practical joke to play.

We felt pretty certain no one had entered our front door. We had a camera. They weren't as good as the ones they make these days, but it worked. The only other way someone could have come into our apartment is through our attic, which was connected to the apartment next door. There were little attic doors in the largest bedroom ceilings. 

I used to tell myself this was some sort of other-worldly or paranormal activity, but the less naive I get, the more I believe our maintenance guy must have entered our apartment through the attic. I assume it must have been the Maintenance guy because he had access to keys, ladders, and such things.  He also gave me very bad vibes. He always made me feel very uneasy. His stares lingered, and he was always hanging around making uncomfortable conversation.

The thing that makes me most uncomfortable is that whomever it was left obvious clues that he had been there. If he had been trying to be stealthy, he surely wouldn't have smashed a banana into the carpet and changed the clock. I wonder what he was doing in our apartment. Just hanging around? How often did he do this? Why was he comfortable enough to leave obvious clues that he had been there?

He was fired after just a few months on the job.   I was relieved at the time. Looking back, thinking about things now, I'm more than relieved. I'll be very happy if that maintenance guy and I never meet again.",1,1.0,0,winelizabethadore,2024-11-15 02:36:03,1grryt9

This night, Mary had picked me up from a party and planned on staying at my house. When we got to my house though, we decided we were kind of bored and wanted to do something. She had her own car with a relatively good speaker and so we figured we'd drive around and blast some music (even though it was around 11:30 at night.)

We started driving around random neighborhoods until we got to this one street. The street is a small roundabout with no houses around it and is almost completely deserted. When we pull up to it, however, we see a teenage girl wearing pajama pants and a hoodie standing completely by herself. Mary thinks that this girl is her friend, pulls over, (no matter how much I told her not to,) and asks her if she's okay. The girl starts looking around nervously and tells us that she's lost, she needs a ride, and asks to use our phone. We tell her we don't have our phones and ask where she's trying to go.

""I'm lost-im trying to go to my aunts house."" She says, and she sounds under the influence of either drugs or alcohol.

We felt bad for her, and she looked only around 14-15, so we asked her where her aunt lived.

""Um-well- I was out with some friends and uh-my brothers looking for me."" 

At this point, we were confused, considering she just told us that she was trying to go to her aunts. She then tries to tell us that she goes to our school, which we know she doesn't, and makes up a fake name saying that it was her ""brothers who graduated last year."" She keeps insisting that we let her use our phones or drive her around, and me and Mary are getting increasingly worried.

""Man, it's just, kind of fucked up that you guys won't help me. Like, your saying you don't have your phone but I know you fucking do, I can see it!""
 She starts digging in her pocket now, putting a pair of sunglasses on and yelling. We tell her theirs nothing we can do and get prepared to drive off.

AND HERES WHERE IT GETS EXTRA WEIRD.

This girl tells us to hold on, goes to passenger  side (where I was seated) and signals a DIFFERENT CAR to pull up behind us. The car was an unmarked, old-looking white van (cliché, i know.) We speed off, obviously, and the girl swears at us, starts physically running after our car, and then jumps into the van. They start speeding after us and follow us for what was at least 10 minutes. 

Mary and I drove about 30 minutes away from my house before going back, just to make sure they didn't follow us. We were terrifed from that night on and never wanted to take another late night drive. Honestly, I still have 0 clue what was happening that night. Stupid teens? A robbery? Something more sinister? It's anyone guess.

So yeah: strange people in a white van who tried to get in our car? Let's never meet, please!",10,1.0,0,Vast_Asparagus4606,2024-11-15 15:17:33,1gs6z34
LetsNotMeet,Banana Peel + Clock ,"I posted this in a different sub, but I can't get it out of my mind. The more I consider it, the more certain I am that someone, most likely my creepy maintenance guy, entered my apartment in a very unconventional way.

This happened  close to ten years ago. Daylight savings time reminder me of a very strange incident.

My husband, baby daughter, and I lived together in a small apartment. We had a clock on the wall in our living room that we never adjusted for daylight savings time. It had been an hour off for months. It was out of reach, and we were really busy.  Rather than changing it, we just joked about it all the time. We rarely relied on the analog clock anyway. Plus, eventually it would be correct again!

SelfImprovement,Break life's back in half: Using Bane's prison routine to improve your life,"I was talking to a friend of mine, who is a massive comic book fan (I've dropped out of that field about 12 years ago), and I realized how Bane, one of Batman's greatest foes, can be used as a tool to self-improve (whilst ignoring the fact he's a drug-addicted criminal). 

This little guide will be simple and concise. Why? Because it was for Bane - the dude grew up in a hellacious prison with little resources. He had it worse than almost anyone, so there's no excuse for you. The guide, and routine, is as follows:

1. Physical exercise: surprisingly, Bane's prison routine did not include weights, just bodyweight exercises (4 exercises for 1000 repetitions is OVERKILL, but we're taking a concept here to apply to our lives, we're not literally copying what Bane did). This is actually perfect if you're overweight or weak in terms of your strength. Naturally, if you like weights more and/are already advanced past the beginner stage, do that instead. A strong body equals more confidence, more attention, more respect, and more power.

2. Reading books: Bane read 3 books a day, which is virtually impossible for anyone that isn't locked up (and even then it's absurd), but the idea of literature being knowledge is, was and always will be true. Bane read everything - from math to weapons training books, and you should as well (as long as it's non-fiction). Self improvement books, science books, skill-learning books, whatever. Knowledge will make you resourceful, a weapon.

3. Martial arts: surviving prison is a hard task to achieve without some proper combat experience, and Bane knew that. I've recently taken up boxing, which is an idea given to me by a friend. Never in a million years did I see myself doing that, but I did and now I love it. Martial arts offer great workouts, more confidence, respect from men, a valuable skill, and new friendships. 

4. Meditation: Bane didn't sleep, instead he meditated for 4 hours every day. Again, it's a comic book, so we cannot apply this literally, but the mental, spiritual and emotional benefits of meditation are demonstrably true. Whether it's for 5, 15, or 50 minutes on a daily basis, releasing all the negative energy out of your body and disconnecting from the world will undoubtedly make you happier. 

5. Positive social interactions: again, Bane's friends were horrible people that didn't really care for him, but the overarching lesson here is that most of them taught him invaluable lessons, whether directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally. Only surround yourself with those who will help you grow, and be genuinely happy for the fact you're growing.

6. Minimalism: unfortunately, in the world we live today, we're conditioned to think material possessions are somehow going to fill voids inside of us. Hinduists called materialism to worst lifestyle to have, and for good reason - you're spending a fortune on things that are worthless. You're wasting months of hard work on something that'll make you happy for a few days. Learn to appreciate the small things in life.

7. Keep moving forward: no matter what's happened, no matter what kind of horrendous pain you're going through, always march forward. Light might not be ahead of you for a while, and the tunnel might be long, but in the end you'll see the sunlight again, and confront it as a much stronger individual than you were going in.",185,0.91,18,One-Party2973,2024-11-14 11:45:24,1grajgp

DecidingToBeBetter,The MODS need your help! ,"


Hi everyone! It's truth time y'all. 

There's only a small number of us active mods in a very busy, very big sub. We try our best to get through all the reports but frankly...it's just overwhelming with such a small number of us to do it. So much so that we don't actually get to enjoy being a part of the sub as much because the list to get through just gets bigger every day. To top it off, life challenges keep throwing curve balls so it's not like we can spend hours every day moderating. 

We also understand that some long term contributors who have been the lifeblood of this subreddit are unhappy as it has become a little bit of a trauma dumping, venting, whinging and whining scrap yard. And if I have to read another repost about porn or masturbating we cannot promise that our brain matter doesn't spattle all over the place. We want to do better. We want it so that people are really getting something valuable from each other. To do that...

WE NEED YOUR HELP. 

To all the active commenters, posters and general cheerleaders of this page and the people who relentlessly support each other. We know you are out there because we see you when we moderate. Just didn't get the chance to write down usernames and for the life of us can't find how to just get a list generated. ( If you know how to do this can you please message modmail?) Also, if you've been very helpful identifying accounts like snooroar...talk to us! We want you! 

Make yourselves known to us on this post as a comment or through modmail. We'd love to see your post and comment history as evidence of your ability to emotionally regulate and guide our participants in making better decisions for them and their unique lives. We need people who are genuinely kind, open, tolerant and compassionate. While also being assertive with addressing the sub rules. 

We look forward to meeting you and welcoming you as mods to help us in making all our lives better!

The rest is just a little blurb of what will be expected: 

""We are looking for what we will call **""community mods""**. There is currently no need for somebody who *just* clears ques and approves posts, we want people who have a invested interest in this community. This does not mean you have to be a long time subscriber, but it does mean you have to be willing to put energy into projects and proposals. Do not ignore any basic mod duties, but said duties wont take you much time, so we want people to go the extra mile with us.

This is suited equally for both experienced and new mods. We are looking for the right people, not the right robots, so dont hesitate to apply even if you have very little reddit experience! If need be, you will be taught how to navigate and operate as a moderator so you can fulfill mod duties. These will require about 10 mins a day, assuming another mod has left anything for you to do. Browse the sub, check the que and mod mail. If you are frequently on reddit, this should be easy stuff. Understand the rules and enforce them, simple!""

Without further adieu, may the fortunes be ever in your favour 😉.

DecidingToBeBetter,"A lifetime of lies, drugs and hyper sexuality: Finally breaking free ","
Title: A Lifetime of Lies: Breaking Free from Self-Deception

Hi everyone,

I’ve been carrying this weight for a long time, and it’s time to get it out in the open. I’ve been a liar for most of my life, and it’s not easy to admit. It’s not something I’m proud of, but I’ve come to realize that I need to face the truth, not only for myself but also to connect with others who may have gone through something similar.

My relationship with lying started when I was really young. I remember being around six or seven when my mom left us with my grandmother. I began stealing and lying as a way to cope. We moved around a lot because we were a military family, and each move felt like a chance to reinvent myself. Every time we moved, I tried to create a better version of me, someone worth knowing, even though I didn’t feel like that person.

Things took a darker turn when I was about 10 or 11. I was sexually assaulted by someone older, and I didn’t know how to deal with it. I didn’t have the support or the language to express what I was going through, so I turned to lies. I became a catfish online, creating fake lives and relationships. I told people things that weren’t true, but it was my way of escaping from the pain of my reality. When people caught on, I just doubled down and kept hiding behind the lies.

Eventually, I moved back to live with my sister’s family in the States. I was bullied at school, felt isolated, and neglected my personal care. To make myself feel less alone, I started inventing fake friends and tragic stories about them. At home, things weren’t much better—verbal and physical abuse only made me feel more isolated. The lies were my shield, my way of pretending everything was fine when it wasn’t.

As I got older, the lies didn’t stop. They got worse. I moved again, trying to create a new image for myself, telling exaggerated stories about my past. I developed health anxiety, convincing myself I had a peanut allergy and avoiding peanuts out of fear. I even told people I’d had severe allergic reactions just to cover up my anxiety. I couldn’t admit to anyone that it was just fear controlling me.

At 14, I started using drugs and smoking, and my lies escalated. I wanted to fit in and feel accepted, but I was terrified of people seeing the real me—the one with all the anxiety and insecurity. When I was 16, I was diagnosed with ADHD, but at 18, my health anxiety took over again. I convinced myself and one friend that I might have cancer. I made up doctor visits, exaggerated symptoms, and created dramatic story to hide the truth . The truth was too scary to share, so I lied to cover it up.

In my early twenties, I genuinely thought I had borderline personality disorder. My behavior was so erratic, and I convinced myself—and others—that this was the explanation. It was easier to believe that than to admit the underlying truth. But this year, after a lot of reflection and self-awareness, I realized that what I was really dealing with was bipolar disorder. It’s like a fog lifted, and I finally started seeing things more clearly.

It was easier to lie to people I didn’t care about, but eventually, I started telling the same lies to my friends. I was trying to relate to them, trying to make myself seem interesting, or to make them think I understood their struggles. It all got out of control, and I didn’t know how to stop. The cancer lie, in particular, stands out. I only told one person about it, a friend of mine. It wasn’t planned—it just came out in the middle of an anxious moment. I thought I had cancer, and I believed it. When I saw my friend again, I felt compelled to keep the lie going, so I said it was my immune system being weak, which wasn’t a complete lie; I was just really sick, but I had convinced myself I had cancer.

For much of my life, I’ve struggled with hypersexuality, a pattern that started in my childhood due to trauma I experienced. By the time I turned 18, it became even more intense, and I made a lot of erratic decisions that, while not directly affecting my family, have ultimately impacted them. I’ve done some things I deeply regret, things I don’t necessarily want to go into, but they were harmful to me in ways I’m still processing. The impulsivity and hypersexuality have been destructive forces in my life, and I want to apologize to those I’ve hurt along the way. It’s something I’m still working through, but I recognize how much it has cost me.

Looking back, I can’t even explain why I lied so much . It felt like the anxiety took over, and the lies were my way of coping with the overwhelming fear. Every health issue I had, I believed it in some way, even if it was just my mind spiraling. But this year, something changed. I stopped believing those lies. It was like I woke up from a weird fog. I started questioning everything, trying to figure out what was real, and in doing so, I realized how crazy I must’ve looked to others. I had convinced myself of these illnesses for so long, but I finally saw that they weren’t real.

But over the past year, things have started to change. I’ve begun facing the truth about myself, even though it’s hard. I’m still learning, and I’m far from perfect, but I’ve started being more honest with myself and those around me. I know I’ve hurt people along the way, and I regret the lies I told, but I’m working to rebuild trust. It’s not easy, and I slip up sometimes, but I’m trying to break free from the fear that made me lie in the first place.

For so long, I thought lying was the only way to protect myself from rejection and judgment. The truth felt too vulnerable, too terrifying. But now, I realize that hiding behind lies only kept me trapped in a cycle of anxiety and fear. I’m learning to accept myself as I am—flaws, mistakes, and all—and slowly, I’m starting to tell the truth.

I’m sharing this because I want others to know they’re not alone. If you’ve ever felt like lying was the only way to protect yourself, or if you’ve hidden your true self for fear of being judged, I get it. I’ve been there. It’s a long road, but there is a way out. I’m still figuring it out, but I’m committed to being honest now. It’s hard, but I believe it’s worth it.

Thank you for reading.",31,0.85,2,Old-Measurement-2403,2024-11-15 10:15:19,1grzxyw
DecidingToBeBetter,Climbing changed my life,"I (25M) used to scoff at the cliché advice of ""get yourself to gym, it's impossible to feel bad after a workout, etc."". Ive never been a particularly sporty/exercise driven person.

Last year I left my relationship of 3 years and I was probably the lowest I had ever felt, I was drinking regularly, overweight and bitter.

One of my friends had been trying to convince me to come to his climbing gym with him for a long time, and I eventually decided to go along with him around 8 months ago.

Almost immediately I was hooked. I signed up for a membership on the same day.

Since starting climbing I have made a lot of significany changes to my life and I have honestly never felt more secure/happy in my self:

- Improved my diet, I cook at least 3 evenings a week 
- stopped drinking completely
- lost ~20lbs
- gained a new friendship group of similarly motivated people
- met my now girlfriend, who is pretty much everything I could hope for in a partner

I honestly don't think  any of this would have happened if it wasn't for climbing, I just needed something to motivate me.

If you're looking for an (imo) engaging alternative to your typical gym, I seriously can't recommend it enough!

DecidingToBeBetter,Fixed my phone addiction for my kids – thank you reddit,"A few weeks ago I posted about how I was feeling guilty after my daughter said “mommy, why are you always on your phone”…

I got a lot of positive feedback and practical tips. Three weeks later, I have implemented your advice and it has been a night and day difference. I wanted to share this here too since it seems like we are all going through it and maybe it will help someone.

**The results:**

* Daily screen time: 6hrs >>> 2 hrs
* Daily phone pickups: 250 >>> 50
* I feel less “scatterbrained” (slightly lol)
* My kids are noticing

Here's what I'm doing...

**Phone free spaces:**

* I made several places “phone free”, and communicated that to my kids
* Now they know when they are going to get my full attention
* I did the playroom and kitchen table

**Strict app blocking:**

* I locked myself out of social media first thing in the morning, and during dinner time (and told my kids)
* For the rest of the day, I set a limit of 15 unblocks on social media
* I'm also tracking my daily screen time and how often I pick up my phone more closely

**Watch my emotions:**

* I reach for my phone when I got stressed, tired, etc.
* When I notice this feeling coming on, I will communicate with my kids
* ex: “I need a few minutes on my phone and then I'll be back”
* Then I will try to call a friend or family to talk about it

I think just reading the comments and knowing that it's something we all deal with, and something we can fix made a huge difference too.

This has honestly been life changing. Thank you Reddit, and to everyone with positive responses.",236,0.99,23,Longjumping_Grass488,2024-11-14 14:07:49,1grdx9n
DecidingToBeBetter,I (18) want to stop being homophobic,"I am 18 and currently at a art school, and if anybody knows art schools, there is a lot of queer people in it. I am originally from Turkey and was raised in a more accepting muslim family, my mother didn't had a turban and my father only prayed friday lunch and I am not even a muslim. However, they were still not accepting of LGBT. I don't think I was heavily influenced, as I am usually the person that disagrees with them on almost everything and LGBT wasn't something mentioned on the table so I didn't see my parents commenting on it unless I asked it myself. My main problem came out when I was more exposed to queer people. And at first, even though I was not fond of it, I really didn't care, ""They are just another human"". I still follow this idea but for the past few months, some sort of feeling has been brewing inside me. It mainly happens when I see a lesbian couple but it can be any queer couple. I see them happy, and that is good they deserve happiness, but you know how old cartoons had these angel and demon personas on the shoulder of the characters? I feel like something like that inside of me is making me hate them and their happiness. Now I am gonna be honest here, I was never really unhappy with my life, but I was lonely. I didn't had much friends and they would mostly leave me after a while and I never were in a relationship. So maybe I envy those lesbian/gay/queer couples? But when I realize this I want to throw out as this is a terrible feeling to have for another person. I wanna be happy for them but all I feel is hate and envy and more hate as if it is a spiral. How can I get out of this hatred? How can I start being more sane about queer people again?",52,0.79,11,kurtbroppa,2024-11-14 21:26:29,1grn68v

AskHistorians,"Short Answers to Simple Questions | November 13, 2024","[Previous weeks!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)

**Please Be Aware**: We expect everyone to read the rules and guidelines of this thread. Mods *will* remove questions which we deem to be too involved for the theme in place here. We *will* remove answers which don't include a source. These removals will be without notice. Please follow the rules.

Some questions people have just don't require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.

Here are the ground rules:

* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right.
* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.
* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.
* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don't realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.
* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.
* Academic secondary sources are preferred. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the 'Oxford Companion' series, or a reference work from an academic press).

TwoXChromosomes,Trans Women are Women.,"Here at r/TwoXChromosomes we try our best to create and maintain an inclusive space for everyone to contribute about women. That includes trans women. We expect our users to adhere to the rules set in place, so as a reminder…

#Trans Women are Women.

We will ***not*** have any transphobia or TERFs in this sub.

For example, telling someone who brings up in posts about women that they’re not talking about trans women, or that bringing up trans women is derailing, is basically the same thing as saying trans women aren’t included in being women. 

Also keep in mind micro aggression and casual bigotry. You may not intend to exclude trans peoples or to cause dysphoria, but it can and does happen.

TwoXChromosomes,"My assaulter contacted me last night saying, ""Your Body, My Choice""","TW: Rape

About a decade ago, I was sexually assaulted in a very violent way. I hesitated calling the cops as he said he'd make my life a living hell, if I did. Tonight he called me, and stated ""Your Body, My Choice."" I had some choice words for him, but it left me terrified.

I haven't slept all night due to anxiety. Luckily though in that time, I filed a restraining order, spoke to my local PD, and ordered a ring doorbell. I did not expect the level of decency coming from the PD. The responding officer told me, ""I have a daughter. I will do everything in my power to make sure you're okay. He is a horrible person, I'm so sorry.""

And like, I appreciate his empathy, but why does having a daughter have to be the point of establishing empathy? I'll step off my soapbox, something to address at another time.

The assault was one of the main catalysts to me going to treatment for unresolved trauma, and my relapse (alcohol). It was so violent I was bleeding days afterwards, due to the tearing. It has been over a decade, but his actions still messed me up.

Edit: Sorry, I didn't mean to make it sound like I didn't appreciate the officer. I absolutely did. He was empathic and kind and gave me a huge hug as I was sobbing. I'm so grateful.",4512,0.9,293,DragonfruitFew5542,2024-11-15 09:45:14,1grz8ot

I had about twelve different voicemails from Mom, asking why I wasn’t responding, begging to know that I was still alive, but I just… couldn’t. It wasn’t worth it because she wouldn’t believe me anyway. Hell, I’m surprised she hasn’t flown over here yet to drag me out. I can hear her now, “You know you’re better than this, Daisy. Get up.” Yeah, great motivation, there.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
It was the voice in my head, telling me that I was worthless, that it would be better for me, for everyone, if I just took myself out of the pool. Not like I contributed much, just a struggling writer who posts horror stories on the internet, not like it was enough to keep the lights on. Then again, I don’t know if anyone would notice if I stopped paying rent in this shithole high rise, other than the slum lord that already bled me dry like a damned vampire. He didn’t even come around anymore, and knew that eviction wasn’t worth the trouble. Cops didn’t give a damn about things out here, and this guy was already on their shit list. Must not have paid his dues to the police union lately. 

BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!!!!

Loud, discordant tones rang from my phone, sitting on the charger beside my bed. I don’t even know why I bothered to keep it charged other than doomscrolling anyway, not like anything was looking up in the world recently. Figured it was just another silver alert, some old dementia patient taking the keys when they shouldn’t. My grandpa made it all the way to Mexico like that one time. Unlike his decaying brain though, mine found the idea of being outside fucking terrifying. Just the slightest hint of stepping out of my apartment was dread-inducing, with an insane amount of things that could go wrong at every moment. Hell, just going to the grocery store can get you shot these days, why risk it?

Not the point, Daisy. Check your damn phone. The sleep in my eyes wasn’t leaving, taking every chance when I tried blinking it away, desperate to put me back under its dreamy spell. My hand darted out, limbs heavy, still not awake, and pulled my phone to my face. It wasn’t even dark out, despite the blackout curtains making it look like the dead of night. No, the phone read 2:37 PM, with the alert notification in full right below.

EMERGENCY NATIONWIDE ALERT: ALL PERSONS

DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, LOOK AT THE SKY. PLEASE CLOSE ALL WINDOWS, DOORS, AND ANY OTHER WAY TO VIEW THE OUTSIDE. PLEASE SHELTER IN PLACE UNTIL THE ALERT HAS BEEN LIFTED. IF YOU ARE NOT IN AN AREA TO SHELTER IN PLACE, PLEASE CAREFULLY MOVE TO THE NEAREST BUILDING WITH ADEQUATE SHELTER.

REPEAT, DO NOT LOOK AT THE SKY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. IF YOU OR SOMEONE NEAR YOU HAS MADE THIS MISTAKE, IMMEDIATELY ADMINISTER THE FOLLOWING EMERGENCY PROCEDURES:

RESTRAIN THE EXPOSED. RIGID, STRONGER BONDS ARE RECOMMENDED.
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REASON WITH THE SUBJECT. THEY WILL TELL YOU THEY ARE UNAFFECTED.
TERMINATE THE SUBJECT THROUGH DISMEMBERMENT OR IMMOLATION. USE BOTH TO BE SAFE.
REMAIN HIDDEN UNTIL THIS ALERT IS LIFTED.

”The hell’s’goin’on.” I mumbled, still in my half-asleep state. I’m barely through the message when a call starts coming through from Mom. God… I don’t want to speak to her but with something like that coming through… I want to think it was a prank, some joker hacking the system for some kicks like Max Headroom back in the day. I don’t know though, so I better at least set Mom at ease. Guess it’s the best time to let her know I’m alive. Deep breath, Daisy, answer the phone. 

I hit the green button, with Mom’s voice coming in almost immediately, frantic, screaming. I can barely make out what she’s saying.

”Daisy? Oh god, Daisy are you okay? Are you safe? Don’t do it! Don’t look out, please!” She was tripping over words and sobs started coming between. “You father… oh, god your father…”

”Mom, what the hell is happening?” The sleep is shaking out, with my fear spiking instead. She never sounded like this. Mom is always the tough no nonsense type, more likely to curse at a problem and beat it into the ground instead of walking away. I barely ever heard the woman cry, much less utter the word ‘god’ without it being in Sunday School reverence. “Where’s dad? What did he do?”

”He was outside doing yard work… you know how your dad is. Next thing I know he’s bashing at the door, trying to get in. He’s… he’s changing. I swear his eyes are gone. He’s practically foaming at the mouth but it’s like all his teeth are just… growing or something. They keep getting longer in his mouth, sharper… I don’t know what to do, Daisy. What do I do? He’s trying to say something but I can’t understand the words.” The words are coming out more forced now, sobs more pronounced and breaths cut short in fear. Whatever apathy I had about talking to her before was gone, now full of fear that this may be the last time I speak to her.

”Mom, you need to hide. Go in the bathroom, there’s no windows or anything. Grab a phone charger, a knife, whatever you can. Don’t. Look. Out. Do you understand?” Jesus, is that me talking? I haven’t had this kind of command in years, not since I burnt out around my mid-20s. Adrenaline is one hell of a drug. “Mom, I need you to confirm. Do you understand me?”

”Y-yes…” She stuttered. “Daisy… Winston was out there with him. He’s gone.” 

Shit. Their dog. Stereotypical bulldog name aside, he was a good boy, probably got spooked about what happened with dad…no. Can’t talk to her about that right now. Got to keep the confidence going or she’ll break down completely. “We’ll find him later. He probably ran off.”

”No, no… he’s gone. Your father has him. He’s… he’s making something with the body. Like a statue or something.” She was muttering now.

”Mom are you moving? Are you going to hide?” I asked again, pressuring her to keep going. “I need you to hide in the bathroom. The one connected to your room, okay? Lock every door on the way, and keep yourself safe. Please, mom.”

Glass shatters as she screams, a garbled sound coming from nearby. There’s a brief thud as Mom drops the phone, making it hit the hard wooden floors of their house. I can hear Dad’s raspy voice, speaking with something unintelligible through a warped mouth. 

“HE HAS ME! DAISY! DAISY PLEASE! TALK TO HIM! HELP!” Her sobs were punctuated by scrapes along the floor with periodic thumps, shattered glass tinkling and crunching on the ground. “NO! NO JEREMY PLEASE, I DON’T WANT TO GO OUT!”

”Come and seeeeeeee,” A hiss was barely audible over her screams, Dad’s voice. I could recognize it anywhere, even through the strange noises he was making. “Worship with usssss” 

“NO! NO PLEASE! STOP! NO, DON’T MAKE ME LOOK!!!” Mom’s screaming pleas are cut short, complete silence on the other line now before she was suddenly begins to whisper, “Praise be…”

”MOM! Mom please, are you okay?” I was screaming into the phone now, holding it to my face on speakerphone to try and get any attention possible. Instead I only got silence, punctuated by the occasional scream in the distance. Nobody answered my cries.

I finally hung up, knowing that nothing would come from staying on the line. My only thought was that at least I have peace of mind knowing my parents are already gone. It’s not some mystery that I’ll never know the answer to, so at least there’s that, I guess. Now I know it’s not a prank either, something really fucked up is going on.

Okay, be logical, Daisy. The alert said don’t look at the sky. Dad was outside when it happened so that confirms something there. Restraining them makes sense now but… destroying them? Good god, that’s… that’s bad if the government is recommending it. Maybe there’s something on the news…

As soon as the thought crossed my mind I found the remote, flipping it to the local news on my hijacked cable. The anchorman was sitting there, worry on his face as voices from behind the camera clamored in nervous agony. I get it, I got to hear my parents die. How many of these people have loved ones they have no idea about? How many were there out of some sense of duty, trying to keep anyone who watched safe?

“We have yet to know if anything can cure the… result, of what’s happening. What we have heard from the CDC and WHO is that this is not an isolated event. This is happening worldwide, with the same symptoms presenting regardless of nationality, race, sex… nothing is discriminatory about this. If you look at the sky, you are dead, effective immediately. If someone you know looks at the sky, immediately seek safety and isolate them, restrain them if possible. This has a one hundred percent infection rate, and will not pick and choose who receives its horror. We hope to have a representative from the CDC on soon to speak.” He was stammering, barely keeping it together. The phone ringing nearly made him jump from his chair, the sweat on his brow drenching his perfectly groomed hair. “Yes, that seems to be them now. Professor Sigurd?”

”Yes, yes this is Professor Sigurd. Please, if you’re listening, we beg you to not go outside. Don’t look out of your windows, don’t do anything that could expose you to a clear view of the sky. Something is changing people.” He was frantic, terror in his voice but also… menace? He knew something the rest of us didn’t yet. “Please, if someone you know is exposed, isolate and restrain them. They WILL try to expose you as well, in any way possible.”

Explains what Dad did, I guess. The professor kept going, though.

”The only thing that affected beings want to do is reinforce their numbers. They’ll do it through any means, even working together. The only thing that we know is that they speak of ‘worship’ for whatever they see.” He continued on.

”I’m… I’m sorry professor, can I ask a question?” Anchorman asks, holding a hand up like he was commanding the caller to stop, “What the hell is up there?”

”As of now… we still do not know. We’re attempting to see how we can view it without causing an infection. It’s a drawn-out process of trial and error.” He replies, shaking in his voice. “It’s currently unknown, though we have tried to see it through cameras and other means, nothing… nothing comes up. It’s like filming a clear sky.”

”So recordings of the phenomena will not cause infection?” Anchorman tries to clarify, a look of relief spreading across the nervous lines drawn taut on his face.

”We have only tried digital recordings, but yes. The infection will not take hold when viewed through recorded video. That said… we have yet to commence live viewing, only trying prerecorded as of now. Please, use discernment and do not try anything that could expose yourself or others.” Still rambling on. He sounds more panicked than before though, something else creeping in. “I want to stress, and I feel that I cannot do it enough, to stay hidden from any of these… things. They are no longer your loved ones. They are no longer the people you know, worked with, or grew up with. They are monsters, plain and simple.”

I turned it off. Not like I had planned to go outside any time soon, anyway. So, no worries about looking at the sky for me. Now, just to lock the doors and wait for things to blow over.

Mom’s screams keep bursting through my mind though, making me jump as if she were right next to me, shrieking for her life as Dad drags her away. It all felt so real that I just had to try. Picking up my phone, and letting out a deep sigh, I called her number. Ringing. The steady, consistent *do-do-do-do* sound as I waited for her was torture. I knew she wasn’t going to pick up, so why the hell am I doing this? It’s only going to go to voicemail, then I have to hear her sounding happy…

The screen changed, video popping up as she answered as a video call. The ceiling was visible only, their fan spinning lazily above, a spatter of red on one blade still dripping down steadily. I was holding my breath without realizing it, but whatever air was still in my lungs began hissing out slowly as I whispered, hoping against whatever terror was causing this… “Mom? Mom, is that you?”

“Come and seeeee, Daisyyyyy…” A whisper barely audible over the phone speaker. Suddenly the screen is hectic, something picking up the phone and flailing around the room. Moments of chaos pass, finally settling on a face. 

What remains of a face, at least. It was definitely Mom, or was at one time, but now the entire upper half of her face was… gone? Like physically there was still the space, but the skin where her eyes and nose once were is just gouged out, scraped raw to expose the bone and muscle in her skin underneath. Her eyes were totally gone, nose cut off at the base, yet I still could feel her staring at me.

”Come and seeeeeee…” She whispered again. No, no no no, this wasn’t right. This wasn’t my mother, this wasn’t anything how she should be. There’s no reason for any of this. “Come and see, Daisy. Worship with us. The seal is broken!”

I didn’t even realize I was practically smacking the shit out of my phone screen, shaking hands doing my best to hit the damned cancel button for the call. The red button finally connected, the disconnect tone hitting right as Mom began to turn the phone screen away from herself, the open door flashing before me as it began to reveal the open sky. My eyes clenched shut as I tossed the phone away, praying for it to end.

Why? Why did I try that? I should have known… I should have known it was going to be bad. Jesus, what’s happening out there…

I got my answer almost immediately, a loud explosion shaking the building, causing windows to rattle. Whatever exploded, it was close, screams coming from outside that could be heard even up here on the fifteenth floor. Another loud boom shook me again, this time feeling even closer. Close enough that the window in my bedroom shattered, bringing the noise outside in, screams echoing from below.

Good god, what is going on out there? I could hear nothing but screams and chaos coming from below, the Atlanta streets in a frenzy, violence ringing through the air. People begging for their lives, pleading for their loved ones, all punctuated by that same goddamned phrase… “Come and see.”

As much as I don’t want to, there might be something useful on TV. If it’s still active. The screen came on, same channel as before, but the anchorman was now replaced by a woman, a small chyron at the bottom of the screen reading out a new message- MARTIAL LAW. ALL EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE SUSPENDED.

That was fast. It had only been… fifteen minutes? Honestly, time is a foreign concept right now. I threw my phone somewhere under the couch while I was trying to get away from Mom, so no telling what it was. The television didn’t have the time either, just more warnings coming across the screen. Those same instructions to dismember or kill anyone affected by the thing in the sky.

”We uh… we’re going to go live to Devin outside.” The new woman on TV was stammering out, looking around nervously like she had no idea what to do. “He’s… volunteered. Volunteered, yeah, that’s it. He’s volunteered to go outside and film the sky for us live to see what’s up there. One second, we’ll switch to his feed…”

The screen cut out to the anchorman from before, now screaming and red-faced as others were dragging him somewhere. He was fighting back, but it was basically useless against the number of people around him. Whoever was recording was following right alongside, saying nothing while some fucked up snuff film was about to go down. The pale fluorescents around them made the beige hallway seem like the most mundane corridor to hell there could be. Finally, they reached a heavy metal door, with the group setting Devin down and pushing his back against it. The camera was shoved into his hands, changing pov to show the scared man who was previously recording. Before Devin could beg for mercy, they pushed him backward through the door, the camera falling with a thud next to him on the ground. They slam the door shut as Devin’s sobbing, bleeding face is captured for the world to see, still lying on the concrete.

“Please… Please I just want to go to my family… please.” He was choking out between pained breaths. “Liza, please, please, be safe, please. I’ll be there soon…”

Didn’t realize it until the screen began to blur, but I was crying now. Jesus, I’ve felt empty for so long that I almost forgot what it was like. Between seeing my own family and hearing what’s on the streets, can’t say I didn’t feel for the guy. Fucking hell on earth, but he probably has no idea where his family is. I was almost rooting for him like I was watching some underdog at the fucking Olympics when he left the camera behind, keeping his head down and running fast. There’s a small car parallel parked right down the street, I’m guessing it’s his, because he dug keys from his pocket before jumping in, car starting with a jump before it was swarmed on all sides. People… no, the blood all over their faces said otherwise. Monsters.

”That bastard!” A woman’s voice cut in, feed switching back over to the studio news desk. The woman was beating her fist on the table, anger overflowing in her voice. “Sorry folks, uh, technical difficulties heeheehee… we’ll be right back.”

The screen flashed out, instead taken over by the emergency alert message, same as before. The people down at the station must have lost the battle with their own sanity, turning on each other… not surprising. 

It took me a few minutes of searching and grasping blindly under the couch, but I finally found my phone again. There was a missed call from Mom. I’m assuming just to try again for her original goal, but I’m… I know what she is now. I’m not risking that. Let’s see if there’s anything else out there though…

Twitter was a cesspool, as usual, with plenty of conspiracies floating around. Reddit wasn’t too much better, some claiming it was the end of the world while others said it was some Russian attack. Meanwhile everything around the world was going through this same nightmare, people turning into monsters outside our doors but we’re arguing on the internet about who’s behind it. Nobody even knew what the hell it was! All of this bitching and moaning, all of this blame being thrown around, and nobody can even know because just looking up is enough to turn you into one of those fucks.

The worst part is that it doesn’t show up in photographs or videos. Not digital, anyway. There was talk of trying analog recording methods, a lot of discussion about how digital can’t capture it because of ‘cybernetic cloaking’ or some shit like that. There’s no telling what’s truth and what’s not at this point.

The analog idea got me thinking though. God, where’s that damn thing at? I ran to the closet to throw open boxes, still packed from moving over two years ago, desperately searching. Finally, I found it, my old Polaroid that Dad got me for Christmas one year. This thing was vintage, and he found it in great condition. I double-checked it was good to go, grabbing a pack of photos for it and loading them in. Camera open, the daylight seeping in from cracks under the window, I tested it out. The shutter gave a mechanical hiss, bulb flashing bright against the relatively dark room, and a small picture zipped right out of the camera’s front. 

Alright, take it out, flap it around for a second aaannnnddd… good. My tiny studio apartment was all there, caught on grainy film against the backdrop. In a world that wasn’t ending, this would be the cover of a Midwest Emo album. Alright, Daisy. Step up. Don’t look up, just put the camera through the window and press the shutter. Don’t even think about it.

Thinking about it was the only thing I could do. Okay, start slow instead. Two hands, nervously reaching from this side of the curtains while turning my head as far around as I could, trying to hold the bulky camera steady enough to snap the picture. I didn’t even know if I would get a picture. Angle it toward the ground now… okay, and click. I could hear the bulb hiss, that same shutter sound, before I yanked it back in, looking with fear at the undeveloped photo jutting out from the slot. 

Pick it up, give it a wave… color began to fade in slowly, revealing the lush greens and browns of trees below in the Atlanta Fall. Around the street though was a bloodbath straight from a horror movie. These… things were just grabbing people, horror on their faces as they were dragged from homes and businesses, all being forced to open their eyes, looking up at the bright, cloudless sky above. Even in the grainy photo, I could still catch the fear in those people’s eyes, some seeing their final moments against their will. Others were right in the midst of their own agony, gouging their eyes out with fingers, scratching any semblance of sight from their face with whatever they could find. I dropped the photo upon noticing a child with what looked like a shard of broken mirror from a nearby car, readying it in front of his left eye for something I knew wasn’t going to be good.

Fucking hell. I don’t want to do this, don’t even want to try seeing what’s in the sky. What if… what if I can do something good though? Maybe contribute something good, solve a part of this big fucked up mystery of a situation. I can try, right?

Deep breaths, Daisy. Deep, deep breaths. Stick the camera through the curtains again, keep it steady, there weren’t any taller buildings than mine nearby, the city starting to level out into suburbs just outside my window. This is it, a clear shot of the sky beyond, but will it work? Will it turn me into… into one of them? Hell, I’m probably dead at this point, still too scared to leave my apartment at the end of the world. Still worried about eviction or paying bills like there’s going to be a tomorrow…

My finger clicks the shutter, that same bulb flash and hiss as it imprinted outside onto the film. Deep, slow breaths, careful not to bump the photo as I bring it back in, making sure to keep looking away from the crack in the curtains, the world outside going straight to hell. I got it. I got the photo. Now just to give it a little exposure so it develops…

Jesus Christ.

It… I see it. Clear as fucking day, I see it. It’s showing up on the Polaroid, this fucking… giant? It looked like a man up top, riding a horse like he was heading into battle. The horse was beyond dead though, skin and nerves flayed, exposing the dark, red, bloody muscle underneath. It was in motion as it was captured on the grimy photo, legs mid-pump, propelling itself toward Earth. No telling how big the damn thing was, but it was larger than the sun in the sky, threatening to blot it out at any moment as it cast a shadow over the world beyond. The rider was even more terrifying than the skinless horse, a charred, barely hanging on body with missing limbs. The foot was barely attached, jostling alongside the horse. Meanwhile the face… the face had its’ eyes gouged out, much like those below, but it looked like his wounds were cauterized, terrible burns marking the top of his visage as his jaw hung open, one side dangling down further in a lopsided grin. 

I wanted to throw up, wanted to scream and open the window wide to show myself it wasn’t real. I could hear something nagging at the back of my mind the entire time, a guttural, whispered voice struggling to speak through a destroyed throat, “Come and see…”

Everything else in my head was screaming, telling me not to listen to the damned thing. It sounds so welcoming though. To look to the sky and let all my worries go, to see the giant figure on the red horse…

No, can’t let go now. I actually did something. I got some kind of answer, right? I did something good? Who the fuck am I even asking at this point other than the voices in my head? At least some are telling me to live, better than most days.

A scream pierced the air from outside, waking me out of the trance I had been in, hand reached out to the curtain in front of me to pull it back. Fuck, no, can’t do that. I pulled my hand back fast, like touching a still-hot pan on the stove, dropping the Polaroid in the process. From lower down, the scream quickly died out, joining the now steady whispers growing loud enough to hear even this high up, all beginning to sync in their strange beckoning, “Come and see.”

They must have gone through most of the street-level buildings already, which means they’ll probably move up here soon. I can at least get the picture on the internet, maybe someone can do something with it. A tweet, a Reddit post, anything. Hell, I’ll put up a TikTok if it gets the attention that could help someone.

It only took moments after I snapped a picture of the Polaroid to post, and not long after that for comments to start flooding in.

STOP SPREADING DISINFO FFS

COOL PIC. ARTIST NAME?

NICE PHOTOSHOP JACKASS BUT THE WORLD IS ENDING.

I TOLD YOU ALL TO REPENT!

Standard run-of-the-mill bullshit, of course nobody would believe it, why believe the batshit insanity happening right outside your window when you could make up conspiracies on the internet? Jesus Christ, I might jump off the roof before I even get a chance to look at the thing. The flood of notifications started to make me just want it all to end, knowing that there wasn’t going to be any help for anyone in this shitstorm of death.

AND WHEN HE HAD OPENED THE SECOND SEAL, I HEARD THE SECOND BEAST SAY, COME AND SEE.

You’ve got to be fucking kidding me. 

As many Sunday School lessons and church sermons I’ve been dragged to in my life, all the southern evangelical hellfire that I’ve heard… there’s no fucking way.

It… it fit though? The four horsemen of the apocalypse… except this is the second one? Jesus, what was the first… the pale horse, I think? No idea where he is but the second was the red horse, the one that was always brought up in sermons about the end times… endless war and bloodshed to really bring everything together.

We really, truly are fucked, I guess.

A crash from below takes me out of my focus, remembering millions of bible verses I had to study back in school despite how bored I was. Hell, Revelations was one of the few that held my attention for longer than a second. The whole thing was like a metal album on the most hardcore hallucinogens possible. Seeing it firsthand is… much more terrifying.

It’s the end of the world outside, a bloody horse and undead rider are hurtling through the sky, and I feel… whelmed. Maybe it’s just the lack of meds and my brain deciding it’s not the worst thing that could happen, but the end of the world feels like a damned relief. Or at least it did until the noises started going downstairs. 

Crashes at first, mixed in with some of the few sporadic screams left in the streets. Then it started getting even closer though, working from the street through the thin walls of my building. Screams below my feet, outside my door… they were finally coming after us.

My phone let out a loud siren again, another alert coming through during the chaos. I look down, seeing if there was any message for safety, shelter, an answer to any of this.

COME AND SEE

That was it. The emergency alert was just the same goddamn thing. Everything is over. 

I don’t know… I don’t know what to do. I’m safe in here, I think. I don’t want to risk opening my door because… then they might come in here. No, stay here. Stay in safety. Don’t look outside, Daisy.

”Come and see.” A voice, but not from the streets below me or even outside my door. It sounded clear enough to be right in my ear, standing beside me, pushing me to go look.

Why not, right? I had already seen the picture, not like looking at the actual thing could break me much at this point, right? 

No. No. Have to figure a way out. Don’t think about looking at the damned thing. Just get out, try to find shelter elsewhere…

Basement. There’s a basement level that has sewer access, I think. Can’t see the sky if I’m underground, can’t get exposed by those things if there’s nothing to make me look at. It’s perfect. 

There’s no rhyme or reason to it. My BPD brain just suddenly said, “You can get out of here,” and next thing I know I’m just rolling with it. The energy is here, so I’m not letting go. I don’t want to die, as much as I’m okay with the world ending.

A knife, a flashlight that barely works… wasn’t much to choose from in the sparse apartment. Have to give myself some credit- at least I wasn’t a hoarder.

It took all of five minutes to get ready, then one minute for all my hopes to get to the basement to fly right out the window. Noises grew louder, the screams advancing up the building along with something new- the smell of smoke.

”Shit… shit, shit, shit.” Is all I can whisper-shout to myself as things get worse. I brace myself, standing in front of the apartment door, eyes closed tight praying to whatever god would send this hell to us that they weren’t going to be right outside just yet. Reach for the knob, get ready to turn, fling, and run…

“Jesus!” The knob was hot, and the fire already close outside. There might not be any way down. They’re probably trying to flush us out. I grabbed a towel off the bathroom sink, wrapping it around the knob this time and pushing it open. Flames were already lighting up the dingy hallway, lights flickering out as fire tore through the electrical system. Whatever fire safety system they had in the building wasn’t doing shit, an alarm ringing without any sort of sprinkler even attempting to help. Smoke was rising high, covering the ceiling before the flames could take it first. Only time was keeping it from burning.

Change of plans, run the other way. The stairs are on the other end of the hall, with only hopes guiding me to see if they would still get me down to ground level. Bursting through the emergency door was like hitting a wall of heat, fire already rising up from the ground floor under the winding stairs below. No way down, only up.

Screams echo behind me from the hallway, creatures running through to pull out flaming bodies, tossing them from windows to see the sky outside. There’s nothing that could get me back there, these damned things already swarming this floor in droves to take more for their own. No, this was… this was it. Face them, or burn below. Neither are any kind of fun way out. Hell, both are going to be painful, and I would rather not do any form of pain.

“Come and see, come and see!” One of the things was practically chanting with glee back in the hallway. Maybe it was better if I took myself out, not give them the chance to get a new recruit. The knife in my hand could probably get right through my neck easily. Maybe if I stabbed myself through the ear it would keep me down. My only worry is that they’ll get to me before I can actually die…

No, the knife wouldn’t work worth a damn. The only other option is… up there. The stairs above me were clear of any flames, just smoke rising slowly to build up above. There was a roof access door up there. Usually, it’s where the teenagers would go to smoke without getting caught, but it would make a good place for a final bow. Twenty-six floors, I’m on fifteen… better start running. 

Except before I can get moving, one sees me. It screams, running for me in a frenzy while still repeating that same damn verse fragment. Come and see, come and see… it was in my head at this point too, screaming on the outside and inside. There’s no escaping it. As soon as it began after me, more joined, running from rooms and the opposite end of the hall, pouring toward me in a chorus of the damned. Down below, more ran up the stairs, flames covering their bodies like living funeral pyres, all coming to attend my wake. No time to hesitate now, I guess.

Stairs were taken two at a time for the next five floors at least, but that was about when I started feeling how out of shape I was. The adrenaline was going wild, but my lungs were burning. Floors above were no better than mine, with creatures already starting to flush through from the roof down. Wouldn’t be surprised if there were people up there when everything went to shit, considering it was easier than smoking on the street for most people. Rising flames kept anyone from escaping though, leaving them to either jump to their deaths or be forced to look outside by the demons.

Air was getting scarce up here as the smoke continued rising, making me cough through labored breaths. Floor twenty-two now, screams echoing behind me as the same creature that saw me initially kept following. Maybe it’s some sort of hive mind they have, because this thing was forming a whole group to run after me, just a couple of flights of stairs behind. Some of them were on fire, spreading the blaze around to others as they packed in tight on the narrow steps. They didn’t stop though, all frothing past each other to get at me. Keep climbing.

Keep climbing.

Keep climbing.

Gritting my teeth and taking the deepest breaths I could finally got me to the roof access. A huge red door with an emergency light blaring above it, loud buzzing from the fire alarm letting everyone know that the world was fucked. The damn thing was already swinging open and closed hard, wind outside fighting with hot, flaming air inside to see who would win. 

“COMEANDSEE! COMEANDSEE! WORSHIP WITH US FOR THE TIME IS NEAR!” So many voices down below on the stairs, all screaming out in the same terrifying rumble, eyeless faces smiling up at me in bliss. They weren’t afraid, weren’t driven by any kind of hunger or goal, they were just… happy. It’s the same looks I would see on the adults during church services, those same smiles of being assured in their place in the world, even after they stepped out of that building and acted like a whole different person than they claimed. That same, fake smile stayed though, making the damaged half of their face look even more terrifying in contrast. The chorus of hell continued as I ran out of time to open the door. They were almost upon me when I finally got up the nerve, walking close and closing my eyes before stepping out.

I can visualize the entire roof in my mind after being up here so much. Straight ahead is the AC unit for the building. To my right is another, shorter building that could interrupt my fall. My left was the best destination. Over the side, right down onto the paved street below, still probably teeming with these terrors. I don’t have a choice. The voices grew louder behind me, screaming “Come and see!” so loud that it began to make my ear buzz with static, deafening in its power.

Run. Run, Daisy. It’s all I can do to keep moving, but I eventually hit the edge, barely stopping myself from falling right over. Stop for a moment, make sure you do this right. Climb up, take a stand, don’t face the road though. No, if I see what’s below, it’s going to make me stop. Don’t stop. Can’t stop. Have to end myself before they can end me.

Feet on the concrete ledge, wind beginning to hit me hard, almost knocking me off balance and into the pavement below, I opened my eyes to see the creatures pouring out of the access door, running behind me. I stepped back, falling backward to face the sky above, losing any stability and giving myself to gravity.

”COME AND SEE!” The voices rang out again. The sun was bright, but in the moment I fell, back to the ground with nothing but the high sky above me, their words echoed louder, “Come and see!”

And I saw. Finally, I saw, while a loud, thunderous chorus, all combined into one singular voice, ringing out once more, “Come and see.”

I beheld a red horse, galloping through the sky with immense speed. War sat upon him, a massive sword held in frail, decaying hands slicing the air as more and more on earth cut each other down, brother killing brother. My last sight before gravity turned me on my head was the horse, his eyes burning bright with the heat of the sun, pure hatred burning in its face.

As my body turned, seeing the creature began to make me feel at peace. This was our fate, but was it a bad fate? The Messiah will be here soon, and the horseman is just bringing his good news. War will be a blight on the earth no more, with no humans left to foster aggression toward one another. Now, we would all come together in worship, spreading the good news of what’s to come by opening the eyes of others. 

My eyes are open, now, though these eyes cannot yet comprehend the beauty of what I’ve seen. No, I’ll need to open up my real eyes, the ones underneath these, then… then I’ll be able to see the true beauty of what’s to come. The true salvation all this bloodshed will bring. The coming of a new kingdom built on the bodies of the damned.

The last fading thought that I have is the same phrase that brought me terror just moments before. My lips part, pushing words out in a whisper against wind trying to rip them through my throat. Three final words before the pavement meets my head, the old me’s plan working perfectly as I hit skull first, spilling my brain over the concrete. My lips still manage to finish the final word though, twitching as the rest of my body falls to the ground.

nosleep,I Think I Need To Break Up With My Girlfriend,"Before anyone feels the need to state the obvious, I know I’m not a good person.

I’m a cheater- always have been. I could lie. I could tell you about how my dad wasn’t around or some Freudian bullshit about how every girl I ever dated could never match up to my mother, but it wouldn’t be the truth. I didn’t have a hard life and my relationship with my mother is healthy.

I’m just an asshole. But I didn’t deserve this.

“Brian, you’re the best thing that has ever happened to me, but I need just a little more time,” Blythe whispered, her long blond hair falling over her reddening, gorgeous face.

“Yeah, sorry. It’s only been nine months,” I scoffed, “You’re just—” I bit my lip. I’ve never really handled rejection well. It isn’t that my ego is fragile or anything, pride is just hard.  “You’re worth the wait. I have work in the morning.” I brushed her hair out of her face and chastely kissed her soft lips.

I should have just gone home and went to bed, rubbed one out for good measure, but a scorned man goes where his dick and the night will carry him.

On the drive home, I pressed my thumb against my cellphone screen like a worry stone and thought of Shelly. She was a six and a half out of ten on a good day, but she never said no.

The phone rang twice on my end before she picked up. “How soon do you want me over?” Shelly purred. I liked that. No hello, no small talk, and best of all no, ‘I need more time’.

“How about you host tonight? I was in the area. I’m about 5 minutes out.” The thought of Shelly in my bed like old times was a nice one, but I didn’t want to risk anyone seeing her car there. I knew Blythe had no reason to be suspicious, no reason to follow me, but I was careful. I’d always been careful.

Shelly agreed. She always did. I was there right on time. I hesitated just for a second in her driveway. I almost pulled back out, but then I started replaying the shock in Blythe’s eyes when I asked. The way she softened her voice when she told me she wanted to take a little more time. Like she thought my feelings needed sparing. That I’d fall apart and cry or something. Her infantilizing tone was too much.

Pride has a way of really fucking things up and so do I. Less than a half hour later, I wasn’t thinking about that anymore; I was busy getting tangled in the sheets with Shelly.

In the heat of the moment, I felt something sting my back. I tried to swipe it off, not wanting to be distracted from her, but it was starting to burn. As I twisted to get a better smack at my back, I saw Blythe at the window, blond hair floating in the wind and her face pressed hard against the glass.

I scrambled to turn around and claw my way through the tangled sheets. In all my glorious efforts, I only succeeded in falling off of the bed and smacking my cheekbone on the wooden frame on my way down. Shelly squeaked at the sharp smack. Something between a stutter, beatboxing, and a juvenile attempt at profanity fell out of my mouth. I finally untangled myself enough to turn towards the now vacant window. Blythe was gone.

I ran out the front door, stark naked to an empty street. Not even taillights winked in the distance.

“Get back inside! Have you lost your mind? Someone’s going to call the cops!” Shelly’s screams rattled in between my ears. I’m sure they would if she kept it up. I glanced one more time down the empty road and turned back inside.

I didn’t mention Blythe when I tried to explain my sudden interest in streaking, but I did tell her I thought there was someone outside the window. At this point, I was starting to doubt that Blythe had been there at all. Hell, that anyone had been there at all. Maybe it was guilt. Either way, the night was ruined. I didn’t kiss her when I left. I didn’t even look back.

The gravel crunched under my Corolla as it crawled down my street. My heart thumped in time with the rolling tires imagining Blythe waiting in the driveway.  Maybe a brick through my window. Something. But there was no sign of Blythe, her car, nor any vandalism. Lost in thought, I smashed the brake with the nose of my car inches from the garage door. The spot on my back started to tingle.

I jingled my keys as I half-skipped to the entryway. I shook my head and grinned. I’d call Blythe in the morning to be sure, but I was confident at this point that I had made a mistake at Shelly’s. I kicked myself internally. But there’d be another night. There always was.

After a fast shower, I checked my back. Except for a small red dot, there was nothing to blame for the burning. Could it have been an asp? Do spider bites burn? A bee sting? My mind wandered, but I didn’t have any solid answer.

Maybe I should be ashamed to admit it, but as soon as my head hit the pillow, I was asleep. Guilt couldn’t override my exhaustion, and I wasn’t all that sure I felt guilty anyway.

My dreams told another story though. My pupils dilated with such ferocity adjusting to the dim lighting of Blythe’s living room I could feel the stretch in my eyes. Although my chest heaved with effort, I could only whisper her name. She responded with laughter- the tinkle of an amused child. My heart battered in my chest. The pain from the bug bite on my back dialed up to 11; sharp appendages caressed the edges from the inside. I choked on the scream trying to throw itself from my lips. I could feel something soft pushing from my stomach, blooming in my esophagus. I gave a forceful cough and felt a thick, squishy lump fly up from my throat and flop onto my tongue. Gagging, I pulled a clump of Shelly’s hair from my mouth. Long strands straggled up my throat as I removed the mass. All the while Blythe laughed.

I woke up a mess- bloodshot eyes and my stomach in knots. I fumbled my phone and called Blythe. The certainty I’d had from last night was fading. The damn nightmare was playing tricks with my head. Or my guilty conscience. Either way, I needed to know. The phone rang. Once, twice, three times – and she finally picked up. She sounded her usual chipper self.  My voice cracked as I lied. I told her I’d called out from work, that I cared about her too much to leave things the way we had last night. And she ate it. She ate it well. The cramp in my stomach released. We made dinner plans and hung up.

I tried to lay back down, eager to get some restful sleep, but my body wouldn’t comply. The relief I felt wasn’t enough to appease the burning on my back.

I stumbled to the bathroom. Upon further investigation, what was once a small dot had most definitely spread. The center appeared to have crusted over a bit. No matter how I twisted or contorted, it rested solidly between my shoulder blades just out of reach. The crusted head on the mound taunted and begged for the sensual scratch of my fingernails. But there was a bigger problem. My cheek was swollen where I’d smacked it on Shelly’s bed frame the night before, a light purple shadow licking the apple. Another lie I’d need to invent to cover my tracks. It was never the cheating that bothered me. It was the lying. It was the having to remember. It was an irritating inconvenience. 

I pulled out my phone to text an apology to Shelly. Given the giant pain in the ass this all had been, I doubt I’d be seeing her for a while, but I believed in keeping all my bridges intact for the crossing. As an afterthought, I asked if she’d been bitten by anything lately.

As I rotted in bed waiting for a reply, soft dreamless sleep found me.

My eyes thrust open as the lump on my back radiated pain. Both cheeks boasted that just-smacked tingle that teased of a fever. I started to think about the time I’d been playing in a brush pile as a child. A black widow had bitten me and I’d been dog shit sick for a few days. But did it burn?

I checked the time and nearly tripped over myself throwing clothes on to meet Blythe. No word still from Shelly. Maybe my odd behavior had spooked her, but no response at all? Weird. No time to think on it now. I hastily deleted the text thread and shot one to Blythe telling her I was on my way. I wouldn’t normally go to dinner sick, but I needed to see Blythe. I just couldn’t shake that something was off and I needed my mind at ease.  I popped a couple of ibuprofen and headed out the door.

For the first time in 9 months of seeing her, Blythe was late. This shit day was turning out to have plenty of firsts. It had only been five minutes at this point, no big deal. I tried to tell myself that maybe there was traffic. A flat tire. She couldn’t find her keys. Anything other than her standing me up. The next five I started to feel a twinge of rot in the bottom of my stomach. She was outside the window, saw everything, and was standing me up as punishment. My armpits leaked fever-sweat. I was angry. Just as I scooted my seat back to leave, she walked in.

“Sorry! Couldn’t decide on shoes!” She struck a pose with her heel lifted before gliding into her seat. I couldn’t help but chuckle; I was about to lose it over a woman and her shoes.

Blythe was completely herself. Smiling and beautiful. I was trying to keep things light, but I’d started to sweat all over now. The thick kind. The kind that refuses to drip. The kind that reminds you of that kid in third grade who spat on you on the bus and it globbed on your cheek. Oh, the kids sucked air and one dared you to do something, but you wore that glob like a coward’s badge and did nothing. You sat there with your head down until your stop, staring at the congealed mess on your sleeve, and you-

“You look like shit, are you alright?” Blythe’s eyebrow was hiked higher than a whore’s skirt and I cackled right there at the table. My stomach heaved. I wasn’t alright. We both knew it. But only one of us knew why.

She settled the tab and invited me over to her place to take care of me. I know I didn’t deserve it, but I needed it. Even the dim lights in the restaurant were starting to bother my eyes.

This is where things get a little fuzzy. I remember most of the drive. I remember seeing Blythe’s door, and then I remember waking up on her couch with the phone to my ear, still ringing.

I shook my pounding head and answered. “Brian Pond? This is Detective Waysome,” he sucked air but didn’t wait for confirmation, “We’re investigating the disappearance of Shelly Moore. She was reported missing by some friends five days ago. It looks like the last call on her log was to your number in the area of 4 AM that morning. Do you have some time?”

My eyes flew open fully now. “I haven’t seen her. Five days? I’m sorry I haven’t been feeling well,” my pitch rose as my vocal cords stretched and seized. “I have to go, but I’ll call you. I’ll call you.” His voice had begun to leak out of the speaker but I couldn’t listen anymore. I jammed my finger repeatedly on ‘end call’.

I had been with Shelly last night, so how had she been missing for five days? None of this made sense. There was no way I’d been asleep on this couch for days. Blythe would have taken me to the hospital, right? I needed answers, and if the sharp stabbing behind my eyes was any indication, possibly an ambulance.

The lining of my brain squeezed as I called for Blythe. The reverberation of my voice off the high ceilings followed by the somber silence lifted the hairs on the back of my neck. I tried to stand, but my legs buckled under my weight. My body sagged. On my second attempt, I managed to stumble down the hall to Blythe’s room. I slid my hand against the wall to guide me as I walked, still not trusting my legs not to crumble under the weight of the raging fever. The patterns on the floor swirled under my feet with each step. I had to be hallucinating. My heart rate hiked, and I called for Blythe again. Still only silence.

Near panicked, I pushed through Blythe’s door. Shelly was sitting on the bed undressed and unmoving, as Blythe carved the last bit of a symbol on her chest. Candles on every surface illuminated the room.  My dry, swollen throat wouldn’t allow me to scream. A skull with grey chunks of meat still attached sat in the center of an altar on the dresser. The walls were covered in symbols. My breath hiked in my chest as I noted that a few matched those carved onto Shelly.

Blythe brushed Shelly’s hair back from her face and tucked it behind her ear, her smile slowly melting into a frown. This had to be a hallucination, a fever dream, something. My brain was cracking and aching trying to comprehend the scene unfolding before me. My throat finally unlocked, and I whispered Blythe’s name. She finally turned to me standing in the doorway and her smile returned. She gently patted a spot on the bed twice beside Shelly, gesturing for me to sit. I didn’t want to, I wanted nothing more than to run, but my legs operated but my legs weren’t my own. They marched themselves to the edge of the bed and I sat. Blythe looked at me with the eyes of a mother regarding their toddler they’d caught twirling their fingers in the toilet water for the third time in a day. Disappointed, slightly disgusted, but still with love. Vomit inched from my stomach towards my throat. I was terrified.

“Let’s start being honest with each other, okay Brian?” She tilted her head while her eyes bore into me; a small smirk quivered on her lips. “I know about Shelly. I saw everything. I can’t even begin to tell you how disappointed I am,” She paused for a second as she sucked in a big breath, her face relaxed and returned her familiar beauty. “I sent a little friend home with you to see what you’d do. To see if things were worth salvaging. And boy was I sorely disappointed!” She clicked her tongue and her eyes bulged. “You slept well considering what was growing inside of you, and then texted her, right after you made plans to see me? Not cool Brian. Not cool at all.”

Blythe was pacing back and forth in front of her bed, erratically throwing her hands around as she spoke. I kept my face as emotionless as possible and listened. I was terrified to say the wrong thing to her. The longer she spoke, the more her eyes began to bulge in and out like a fucked up cuckoo clock; spit flew from her mouth with every accusation. The smell of burning hair wafted across the room. My eyes flicked to the alter where a small clump of hair singed from a nearby candle. Blythe’s grin stretched, showing all her teeth. I imagined her biting into chunks of my skin and swallowing like a crazed cannibal, making sure I’d never be able to leave her. Fear was eating the small remnants of the rational part of my brain that was left. Her bulging eyes now glittered with interest. Like she could see inside of me. Like she knew. “Right, that. I guess you’re not the only one keeping secrets Brian, but I told you I needed more time! But before we get into any of that, let me help you with your back.”

Blythe danced her way behind the bed, humming. The creaking of the springs in the mattress as she crawled towards me twisted my stomach. She slid her legs on either side of my body and twirled her finger gently in circles around the monstrosity on my back. She leaned in close, her hot breath against my back and lips brushing me in a way that bordered erotic as she whispered. My legs still wouldn’t work to run. When the whispering stopped, she ran her hot tongue across the lump. As the saliva cooled, something began to pulse under the surface of my skin, pushing and stretching its way out. “Yes! You’re doing such a good job!” Blythe squealed, “What a good girl! Come meet my friends!”

There was a flat pop as the pain in my back peaked and then subsided. My body crumbled forward as I wept from the pain. I felt flaps of skin flutter as the thing set two fuzzy feet onto either side of the wound and heaved itself out of my back. It scurried up to my shoulder and twitched as it hesitantly hovered its furry, bloody leg at the entrance to my ear. “You won’t fit in there anymore silly! You’ve gotten too big!” Blythe cooed. I shivered as it twitched once more before jumping onto Shelly. Blythe unwrapped her legs around me, clapping gleefully as she made her way back around the bed to watch.

I knew what it was the second I felt its legs on me but admitting it while it crawled out of my skin would have taken me past the point of insanity. Now that I could see it on Shelly, I couldn’t deny myself the truth anymore; it was a spider. A huge god damn spider. It clamped its legs around Shelly’s head with its abdomen pressed hard against her face. I had no knowledge of nor experience with giant spiders, but my brain screamed that it was eating her. I couldn’t help it, I puked and sobbed. 

The last bit of hope that clung to all of this being a fever dream died as a low, muffled, moan leaked from Shelly’s mouth underneath the spider’s fat body. Blythe grabbed a jar off the altar and threw it at my head, narrowly missing. The jar shattered as it smashed behind me. A combination of ammonia and rot replaced the singed hair smell. The symbol behind me smeared as the foul liquid wept down the wall. “Don’t you dare fucking cry for her Brian! She’s a whore!” Blythe sobbed as she screamed. As more of the symbols smeared behind us, I felt a pressure release from my legs. I could wiggle my toes! Blythe was wailing with her hands ripping at her hair. The spider didn’t seem bothered by the noise, still pulsing and shivering against Shelly’s moaning face.

Blythe had completely lost it. If I thought I was terrified before, I lack the words to describe what I felt at that moment. There was no doubt in my mind- Blythe was going to kill me. My eyes darted, looking for a weapon. Finally, they landed on a snow globe I’d bought Blythe a month ago on our trip to New York. Sleeping with Blythe in the hotel was where the idea of living together was born. Where I had decided I didn’t want to spend any more nights without her in my arms. Where this whole mess started. I snatched the globe from its place on the stand and slammed it against Blythe’s head as hard as I could.

Blythe dropped to the floor. The room fell silent except for Shelly’s ever-softening moans. I couldn’t be sure Blythe wasn’t faking, but I couldn’t bring myself to check. I needed to get out of there as fast as possible, for my sanity more than my safety.

I slammed the door behind me to trap the spider inside and ran to the garage. I wanted nothing more than to run, but I had to be sure the spider was dead. I couldn’t end up like Shelly. I grabbed the gas canister for the mower and with a fresh wave of nausea, headed back into the house.

I threw gas on the curtains before splattering a trail to Blythe’s bedroom door. Shelly didn’t deserve to die here, but as far as I knew, she was gone the second the spider suctioned itself to her face. I grabbed the matches by the fireplace, lit one, and threw it onto the curtain before finally running out the door and tasting the night air.

I tripped over my feet before landing on the lawn. Blood loss and shock were whispering to stay. To let this soft grass be home. I was so tired. But images of Shelly sitting naked, the life being sucked out of her broke me of giving up and adrenaline surged once more. I shakily pulled myself up and into my car.

I drove for two hours straight before my gas light dinged. I booked the closest no-contact hotel room and arrived on fumes. I was covered in sweat, puke, and blood. The plan, however poor, was to clean up, rest only for an hour, refill my car, and keep driving- put as much distance as possible between everything that had happened and myself. I wanted so badly to believe I had made all of it up. That Shelly was fine and not texting me back because I had made an ass out of myself. That I had slept through the dinner with Blythe. That I was still asleep, dreaming the most fucked up fever dream I’d ever had in my life. But the pain from the gaping hole in my back wouldn’t let me pretend.

I’m not ashamed to admit I cried in the shower until the lines in my hands were peaks and valleys. I tore up the bedsheets to make a makeshift bandage for my back. It looks disgusting, but I can’t get help. I can’t even begin to think of a story I could tell the hospital that would explain my injuries. Or if the police were looking for me for Shelly. Or the fire. Or Blythe.

Even exhaustion hasn’t blessed me with sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I picture Shelly naked with symbols carved all over her body, covered in webs. The spider on her face, pulsing and shaking in ecstasy with hundreds of babies on its back. I should have stood on the lawn and watched the whole house burn. Just to be sure.

I went out to the car and got my work laptop to search for news articles on the fire I started at Blythe’s, but the information was limited. As of the last time I searched, they hadn’t reported any bodies. It’s being referred to as an accidental fire.

My mind was still swimming, so I started to write. I need someone to know my story. I need them to know that I -never meant for this to happen. Even after almost a year of seeing Blythe- loving her, I had no idea she was into anything like this. She never once acted unstable in the entire relationship. I never meant to hurt Shelly. She didn’t deserve to be caught up in this mess, and I shouldn’t have left her.

For the last 10 minutes, I’ve heard something softly tapping at my hotel door. Fear has a way of filling in the gaps. My brain tells me the feet are soft but strong. Furry and many. I won’t get up and I won’t look. I’ve seen enough. There’s a storm coming. I can hear Blythe’s tinkering laughter riding on the winds. The giggling of a child who knows they’re about to pull a very naughty trick.",109,0.97,9,Equivalent_Ad_3482,2024-11-14 20:22:54,1grlz9e
nosleep,My wife just admitted that she's an alcoholic. And it doesn't stop there...,"“I think I need to go to rehab.”

My heart dropped when I heard that. It came out of nowhere. The woman I was married to - and living with - had been struggling in the throes of addiction, and I was none the wiser? I had never felt so taken aback. 

“Carrie, what do you mean? I don’t understand where this is coming from,” I said, gingerly taking her hand in mine. 

“Exactly what I said. I need help, John. I’ve been drinking again. Like, a lot.” 

My mouth involuntarily fell open. Carrie had admitted to having alcohol dependency after graduating from college, but I had always been under the impression that she’d nipped it in the bud. 

“Honey… How long has this been going on? I never would have guessed if you hadn’t told me,” I replied, taking a step back. 

“I know,” she said, tears welling in her eyes. “It’s been six months. I’ve been drinking vodka to hide the smell. That nightly glass of wine… it’s actually cranberry juice and Smirnoff. I’ve been throwing the empty bottles in the dumpster behind my work so you wouldn’t catch on. I’m sorry that I kept this from you, I really am. I just couldn’t bear the thought of losing you over it.” Carrie broke down, tears streaking down her cheeks. 

“Hey, hey. I would *never* leave you over something like that. You are the love of my life. We’ll get through this together,” I reassured her, gently rubbing her back. 

“Really? That makes me so happy to hear.” She wrapped her arms around me, and she stayed there for a long time, sobbing into my shirt. “Thank you for being so accepting. I needed that,” Carrie said, finally pulling away. 

“That’s what I’m here for. I’ll support you no matter what - but there’s something that I need to know.”

“Anything for you.” 

“I need you to be honest with me. Is that all you’re hiding?” 

Her eyes widened, and I could see the wheels turning in her head. “No, this was it. There’s nothing else going on.” 

“Carrie. Don’t lie to me. We’ve been married for thirteen years. I know when you’re not telling the truth.” 

“Fine. I’ve been going to a support group. You know, for alcoholics.” 

My brows furrowed. “Okay? And why did you feel the need to keep that from me?” 

“Because it’s not working. This was a lot to get off my chest. I don’t want to talk about it anymore.” 

“Alright. But we’re going to revisit this later.” 

She nodded, before darting into our room and locking the door. I didn’t know what she was playing at, but I knew that my wife wasn’t telling the truth. Not all of it, at least. And I was determined to find out what she was hiding. 

Now, I wish I would have just left her alone. 

Carrie didn’t check herself into rehab right away. She said that she had to “make some preparations” before being admitted. No problem there. What *was* an issue was the late nights that she would spend out with people she claimed to be friends, or coworkers, or family. I knew better. 

Each time Carrie would tell me that she was coming home late, I’d check her location. She’s not the best with technology, so I’d wager a guess that she forgot that she shared it with me. And I used that to my advantage. 

Whenever my wife made up an excuse not to come home, her phone said that she was always at one spot - the abandoned church on the outskirts of town. So I did what any suspicious husband would do. I tried to catch her in the act. 

“Look man, I don’t know if this is the best idea,” my coworker, Jeremy, said as I neared the parking lot. 

“Oh yeah? Well, what would you do in this situation?” 

“I’d probably just, like, call the cops or something.” 

“Really? And tell them what? That my wife might be boinking some random dude in an empty church? They’d be more likely to write *me* a ticket for filing a false report.” 

“Whatever man, I tried to warn you. Good luck.” And with that, the line went dead. 

“Thanks, I guess,” I grumbled, slapping the car in park and pocketing my phone. 

I glanced up at the run-down building before me, steeling myself for what I was about to do. The church was even creepier in person. A fire had left it completely charred, evidenced by the imprints left around the shattered windows. Vines snaked along the exterior, lending to the place’s eerie ambience. I *really* didn’t want to have to go in there, but I knew that I didn’t have any other choice. 

After reassuring myself in the rearview mirror for what must have been at least ten minutes, I finally gathered the courage to go inside. I crept up to the entrance, my eyes darting frantically around the parking lot. I felt like I was doing something wrong. Like one misteps would have the local police force swarming me in an instant. 

I quietly pushed open the front door, breathing a sigh of relief when it didn’t creak. The church was dark, but I could see a faint light emitting from one of the rooms toward the back. My heart jackhammered in my chest. Was I really doing this? What if Carrie found out? It would break her. 

No. She wasn’t being honest with me, and I had to know why. I couldn’t afford to turn and run. Not after making it so far. 

I pressed forward, following a path that had been cleared through the debris. Aside from that, the interior looked just as I imagine it had the day of the fire. Everything had been burnt to a crisp, save for a marble statue of the Virgin Mary near what used to be a stained glass window. I shuddered when I saw it. It felt as if its eyes were following me around the room, casting judgment on me. 

After a painstakingly long time trying to remain silent, I finally made it to the source of the light. I cautiously peeked my head around the corner to what I assumed was someone’s hollowed out office. What I saw still haunts me to this day. 

Carrie, along with about four other pale figures in hooded robes were gathered around a man’s flayed corpse. His organs had been carved out, and the group was chanting in an unintelligible language. Beneath the body lay what appeared to be a pentagram. 

I ducked out of view, clutching my chest and trying to stifle my breathing. This couldn’t be happening. I began to question everything I knew about my wife. I couldn’t believe what I had just seen. 

I did the only logical thing I could do at that moment - I hightailed it out of there. I crept out of the church as quickly as I could without alerting any of those lunatics, and I raced home, going well over the speed limit. 

Once I arrived back at the house, I tried my best to steady myself. Hot tears stung my eyes as I pulled out my phone. I didn’t want to do it, but I knew that I had to. I steeled my resolve, and I called the police on my wife. 

“Hello, 9-1-1. What is your emergency?” 

“I th-think I just saw a cult ritual. There was this guy, and he was-” I nearly vomited just recanting the gruesome scene, but I managed to keep it down. “The man, he was… dead. Please, you have to send someone. It was at the old church on Fifth Avenue.” 

“Alright sir, stay calm. I’m sending a squad car. Are you in the vicinity?” 

“What? N-no, I’m safe. I-” 

My eyes grew wide, and for a moment, I thought that I might pass out. Just then, I received a text from Carrie. My breathing shallowed as I opened it. 

There was a picture. One of *my* car sitting in the church parking lot. It was followed by a close-up of me in the driver’s seat. My heart thumped wildly in my chest as a text bubble appeared. 

*We need to talk. If you tell ANYONE about this, you’ll be next.* 

“Hello? Sir, are you still on the line?” the operator asked, pulling me out of it. “What did the man look like?” 

“Uh… I’m not sure. I’m sorry, but I have to go.” I hung up before she had a chance to protest. 

I didn’t waste any time. I packed what I could in the few precious minutes that I had, and I left. I have a feeling that I just messed with some *very* powerful people. I’m going to get as far away from that town as possible, no matter the cost. I’m not sure what’s next for me.  

All I know is that I don’t want to end up like that man with his chest open for all to see, lying on the floor of an [abandoned church.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/)",379,0.89,52,HorrorJunkie123,2024-11-14 11:33:40,1gra94e

nosleep,I Found My Little Sister's Diary. I Wish I Hadn't.,"My little sister, Emily, always loved keeping a diary. She had stacks of them, pastel covers with little locks, each one filled with messy handwriting and stickers. She used to guard them fiercely, threatening to tell on me if I so much as looked at them.

But Emily passed away three months ago.

She was only eleven. A freak accident at the lake—she fell in, hit her head on a rock, and drowned before anyone could get to her. The funeral was unbearable, and afterward, I couldn’t bring myself to touch her things. Her room remained untouched, like a shrine to the girl she used to be.

But last week, Mom asked me to start sorting through her belongings. I found her latest diary in the bottom drawer of her desk. It was unlocked.

I thought reading it might bring me some closure. I thought it would help me feel close to her again.

I was wrong

The first few entries were normal.

“Today we had pizza for dinner. I took two slices before Joey could get them all! He got mad, but I don’t care.”

That made me smile. Emily always loved teasing me. The next few pages were full of harmless ramblings—complaints about school, doodles of flowers and stars, lists of her favorite songs.

But then, about halfway through, the tone started to change.

“I saw the man again today. He was standing in the backyard, watching me through the window. I told Mom, but she said I was imagining things. He’s always there, though. I can feel him.”

The man?

I paused, flipping back through the earlier entries. No mention of him before. Maybe it was just Emily’s overactive imagination. She’d always been a little jumpy, a little too eager to believe in monsters under the bed.

I kept reading

“The man came closer last night. He tapped on my window. He didn’t say anything, just smiled at me. His teeth are so big. I wanted to scream, but I was too scared.”

I felt a chill run down my spine. Emily’s handwriting got messier with each entry, her words more frantic.

“He comes inside now. He stands at the foot of my bed while I pretend to sleep. He whispers my name. He says he’s waiting.”

Waiting for what?


I flipped to the last few pages, my heart pounding.

“Joey doesn’t see him. No one does. He told me not to tell. He said they wouldn’t believe me. He said I belong to him now.”

I stopped reading. My hands were shaking. This had to be some kind of prank, a made-up story Emily wrote to scare me. But the way she described it, the fear in her words—it felt real.

Too real.

That night, I couldn’t stop thinking about the diary. I couldn’t shake the image of Emily, lying in bed, too terrified to scream while some stranger stood over her. I barely slept.

When I finally drifted off, I dreamed about her. She was standing at the edge of the lake, staring at me with wide, unblinking eyes. Her lips moved, but no sound came out.

When I woke up, I was drenched in sweat.

And there was mud on my shoes.

I told myself it was nothing. Maybe I’d gone outside to clear my head and didn’t remember. But the next day, I found a page from Emily’s diary lying on my desk.

I hadn’t brought the diary upstairs.

The page wasn’t one I’d read before.

“He says Joey will come next. He says Joey will join me soon.”

My blood turned to ice.

That night, I locked my bedroom door. I tried to convince myself it was all in my head, that grief was playing tricks on me. But as I lay there, staring at the ceiling, I heard it.

A tap.

Tap.

Tap.

On my window.

I didn’t want to look. I couldn’t. But something made me turn my head.

He was there.

A man, tall and thin, his face pale and stretched like wax. He smiled at me, baring rows of jagged teeth, and pressed a single finger to his lips.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe.

When I woke up, it was morning.

The window was locked. No sign of anyone outside. I almost convinced myself it was a dream, until I went downstairs and found another page from Emily’s diary on the kitchen table.

“He says it’s time. He says Joey belongs to him now.”

I haven’t slept since. I haven’t left the house. I keep hearing taps at the windows, whispers in the dark. Last night, I found muddy footprints leading from the lake to my bedroom door.

I think I understand now.

Emily didn’t fall.

She didn’t hit her head.

He took her.

And now, he’s coming for me.

nosleep,I found a journal belonging to my great great grandfather. It's the most terrifying thing I've ever read.,"For context, I'm a 23 year old history student at college in a small town in the United States. I love learning about history, specifically wars. My grandfather passed away recently after a long battle with Stage IV leukemia. He and I were very close. He would tell me stories about his combat experiences in Vietnam. A few days later, I received a package from his estate. ""Dear Mr. Thompson. Enclosed are a few items your grandfather wanted you to have."" I opened the package to reveal a leather bound journal and a WW1 era dog tag. I opened the letter accompanying the items. ""Jack. This is something I never told you for your own good. Grandpa."" I took a deep breath and opened the journal.

Journal of Private James Holden, 2nd Battalion, Western Front

**October 5, 1917**
They say the war will end soon. I’ve heard that lie before, but I write it here for the sake of hope. The trench is the same as always mud up to our knees, rats growing fat on the dead, and the constant stench of decay.

Tonight, the fog rolled in thicker than I’ve ever seen. Corporal Davies swears he saw something moving out in no man’s land. We laughed it off, but he wouldn’t let it go. I don’t blame him. The silence feels… wrong. Even the guns seem hesitant.

**October 16, 1917**
Something happened. I can hardly hold the pen, my hands are shaking so badly.

Willoughby—young lad, barely out of training—vanished during the night. He was on watch with me when he suddenly dropped his rifle and climbed out of the trench. He said nothing, just disappeared into the fog. We called after him, but he didn’t respond.

Hours later, he came back. Only, it wasn’t him. Not really. His uniform was torn, and his skin was grey as ash. When he smiled, it wasn’t a man’s smile—it was too wide, too unnatural.

We shot him. God help us, we had no choice. But even after the bullets, he kept moving. It took a bayonet through the chest to stop him.

We buried him just before dawn. No prayers, no ceremony. None of us could look at the grave for long.

**October 19, 1917**
The whispers started last night. I thought it was the wind at first, but no… it’s voices.

Davies claims they’re speaking to him, calling his name. He says he can hear his mother’s voice, telling him to come home. I told him it’s the war playing tricks, but I’m not so sure. I heard something too—my sister, Mary, who died years ago.

The men are on edge. Some won’t speak. Others won’t sleep. I fear what tonight will bring.

**October 24, 1917**
We’re cursed. There’s no other word for it.

Davies tried to leave. We found him at the edge of the trench, staring into the fog. He fought us when we pulled him back, screaming about ""the light"" and ""the voices."" It took three of us to restrain him.

By morning, he was dead. His body was cold as ice, his skin pale as death itself. We buried him next to Willoughby.

The whispers grow louder. I swear I saw shapes moving in the mist, but every time I looked, they vanished.


**October 29, 1917**
Another one gone. Pritchard this time. He walked into the fog like Willoughby did. When we found his body, it was covered in frost.

The whispers are constant now. They call my name. They laugh.

I dreamt of my family last night. They were standing in no man’s land, their faces twisted into horrible smiles. I woke up screaming.

The fog doesn’t lift anymore. Day and night, it surrounds us. I’ve stopped counting how many men we’ve lost.

**October 30, 1917**
No one is left. Only me.

The trench is silent, save for the whispers. They’re louder than ever, and now they’re inside my head. I see the faces of the men who died, their hollow eyes watching me from the mist.

I don’t know how long I can hold out. My hands are numb, my breath fogs in the air. The cold seeps into my bones.

They’re calling me.

I think I’ll go.

I closed the journal, my eyes dilated and breathing rapid as my heart nearly burst from my chest. It shouldn't have been possible. It didn't make any sense! I made my way to the window to look outside. There was a heavy fog rolling in, usual for this time of year. My eyes looked around, then widened when I saw something that made my blood run cold. It was Grandpa. Standing there in his combat uniform with a too wide smile on his face. His skin was grey and he was mouthing something. I could just barely make it out through the fog.

nosleep,"I was digging through old archives, looking for old Civil War documents, and came across something I thought I would never find.","I am a very big Civil War buff I like trying to find old documents scouring through libraries to see if there’s anything I can learn that I can’t find online through old journals or note books and the other day I was digging through the back at the wilderness branch library in Orange County, Virginia when I came across an old notebook tucked away that looks like it hasn’t been moved in many years I decide to take it off the shelf sit down and read it and afterwards I knew I had to translate everything into my notes and post it for you all here is what I found



I never thought I’d die in the rain. I imagined an end under a hot Southern sun, maybe at the edge of a cannon’s blast or in a frenzied charge across an open field. But there I was, lying face-down in a puddle, soaked from the relentless downpour that had drenched the forest for days.

My name’s Corporal Jesse Langston, 14th Mississippi Infantry. The year was 1864, and I was in the middle of the hell they call the Battle of the Wilderness. Fires raged through the woods around us, licking up trees and the wounded alike. The smoke choked the air, thick with the coppery scent of blood. I’d seen enough horrors to last a lifetime, and that night, I reckoned it might end right there.

But then, as the smoke closed in, my vision blurred, the pain in my leg faded, and my eyelids grew heavy. I figured that was it—my last breath, my final sleep.

When I woke up, the first thing I noticed was the heat. The Southern woods were stifling, but this was different. The air was so thick with humidity, I felt like I was breathing through a wet cloth. The smell was different, too—sweet and rotten, like flowers left too long in the sun. And the sound… strange animals called out, and the underbrush rustled with life. It was like nothing I’d ever heard before.

I sat up, disoriented. The forest around me wasn’t right. The trees weren’t the familiar oaks and pines of Virginia; they were enormous, wild-looking things with strange, waxy leaves and vines that hung like curtains. I glanced down at my uniform, caked with mud, but then I looked at my hands—there was a rifle in them, all right, but it wasn’t mine. This weapon was… sleek, black, strange. No musket I’d ever seen.

I was in the wrong place, maybe even the wrong time, though I couldn’t let myself believe that just yet. I stumbled forward, feeling the weight of a pack on my back that didn’t belong to me. I’d fought long and hard in the war, seen horrors enough to make any man question his sanity, but this… this was something else.

Suddenly, a burst of sound erupted through the jungle, like a thunderclap but sharper, almost metallic. I hit the ground, instinctively gripping the strange weapon in my hands. My heart was pounding as I lay there, trying to process everything.

Then, out of the shadows, I saw them: men in olive green uniforms, faces streaked with dirt and exhaustion, weaving through the trees. But their gear was strange, their helmets rounded, their packs stuffed with things I couldn’t recognize. They were dressed as soldiers, but not in any uniform I’d ever seen.

“Hey!” I called out, barely managing a croak. My throat was bone-dry.

One of them froze, his eyes scanning the jungle. He raised his weapon, and his gaze landed on me, confusion flickering across his face. “Who the hell are you?” he shouted, a thick accent that I could barely understand.

“I… I don’t rightly know,” I stammered, looking down at my muddied, Confederate-gray trousers, my boots still caked with Virginia clay. “Where… where am I?”

“You’re in Vietnam, buddy,” he replied, keeping his weapon trained on me. “Now who the hell are you?”

“Corporal Jesse Langston, Mississippi Infantry,” I said automatically, though the words felt hollow, meaningless.

The soldier frowned, looking back at the others. “Mississippi Infantry? What kind of joke is this?”

I didn’t have any answers for him, or for myself. I felt like a ghost, wandering through some strange afterlife. The soldier lowered his rifle, his face softening with a mixture of pity and fear.

“You’re coming with us, all right?” he said. “We’ll figure out what to do with you later.”

I nodded numbly, following them through the thick foliage. I tried to make sense of my surroundings, but nothing felt real. The forest seemed alive in a way I couldn’t understand, with insects buzzing louder than gunfire and plants that looked like they could swallow a man whole.

As we walked, the soldiers whispered to each other, throwing glances back at me. I couldn’t blame them. I was a relic, a piece of a different world that didn’t belong here.

Hours passed, maybe days. The jungle around us grew denser, the air hotter. Every sound made me jump—the distant cries, the hum of something overhead that made the trees shudder. At some point, I realized we were being followed.

The soldiers moved fast, silent as shadows, and I struggled to keep up. My legs ached, and my heart raced, but then I heard it: a rustling in the bushes, a whisper of movement. Before I knew it, there was a crack of gunfire, sharper and deadlier than anything I’d heard before.

I dove into the mud as bullets tore through the air, splitting trees and sending splinters flying. The soldiers returned fire with rapid bursts, their strange weapons lighting up the darkness. I gripped my rifle, feeling the cool metal under my fingers, and instinct took over.

I fired, though I couldn’t see the enemy. The soldier beside me shouted something I didn’t understand, but his voice was drowned out by the chaos around us. It felt like the war all over again, the same violence, the same desperation.

When the shooting stopped, the jungle fell silent, save for the labored breathing of the soldiers around me. I looked down at my hands, trembling, covered in mud and blood that wasn’t mine. It felt like I’d been thrown back into the same nightmare, only now it was dressed in different colors, new sounds, new faces.

The soldier who had first spoken to me—who I now knew as “Jack”—looked at me with something like understanding. “You’re not supposed to be here, are you?”

“No,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “I don’t… I don’t know where here is.”

Jack put a hand on my shoulder, a strange look in his eyes. “You and me both, Langston. None of us belong here.”

We trudged through the jungle until dawn, the oppressive heat giving way to a dim light that crept through the trees. I kept my eyes on the horizon, hoping for some sign that this was all just a dream. But the jungle kept going, stretching endlessly in every direction.

By the time we made it to their camp, I knew one thing for certain: I was trapped in a different war, one I could barely comprehend. But it was a war all the same, and I was a soldier.

And in war, the only way out is through. After making it back to camp I decided to go back to sleep. Maybe this was some all weird dream maybe once I woke up everything would be back to normal or I could have some kind of sense and understanding about what is happening.

When I opened my eyes again, the dense jungle canopy was gone. In its place was a canvas ceiling, stained and sagging with rainwater that had pooled on top. The sounds of insects and distant gunfire were replaced by low moans, quiet sobs, and the clinking of surgical tools.

I was back in the Civil War.

My head felt thick, like I was pushing through a fog that wouldn’t clear. I sat up, groaning as pain shot through my leg, and looked around. Rows of cots stretched out around me, filled with wounded men. The tent was dim, lit only by a few oil lamps that flickered and threw shadows across the makeshift hospital.

A nurse appeared at my side, her expression weary but kind. “Easy now, soldier,” she said, gently pressing me back down. “You’ve been through quite the ordeal.”

I stared at her, still dazed. Her face was soft and familiar, a world away from the hardened, grim soldiers I’d walked alongside in that strange jungle. My mind spun, struggling to grasp what was real.

“Where… where am I?” I managed to croak.

“You’re back with the 14th, Corporal Langston,” she said, a soft Southern drawl in her voice. “You were found unconscious in the Wilderness, just outside of Spotsylvania. You’re lucky to be alive.”

The Wilderness. Spotsylvania. The words felt familiar, like pieces of a dream I’d half-forgotten. But then images of the jungle returned—the strange soldiers, the foreign weapons, the terrifying roar of the unknown battle. It had felt so real. I could still feel the weight of that sleek, black rifle in my hands.

“Vietnam,” I muttered, more to myself than to her.

The nurse’s brow furrowed. “Vietnam?” she repeated, looking at me with a mix of confusion and concern.

“It’s… nothing,” I stammered, forcing myself to focus on the tent, the familiar scents of blood and sweat and antiseptic. Everything around me felt vivid and solid, but the memories of the jungle clung to me, like they’d seeped into my very bones.

For days, I lay there, recovering in that makeshift hospital, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d left part of myself back in that other place. I could still hear the sounds of that faraway jungle in the quiet moments—rustling leaves, distant voices, the thunder of gunfire unlike anything I’d ever known.

One night, as I lay awake in my cot, staring up at the tent ceiling, a young soldier beside me stirred. He’d lost a leg in the Wilderness, but he wasn’t making any sound, just breathing heavily, his eyes wide and staring into some unseen distance.

“It was different,” he murmured. “The guns… the fire… it was different. Like nothing I’ve ever heard.”

My heart skipped a beat. I leaned over, trying to catch his gaze. “What did you see?” I whispered.

He looked at me, his face pale, his eyes haunted. “It was like… another war,” he said, voice trembling. “A place we shouldn’t be. Men with strange weapons, in a place with thick trees, thicker than any forest here.”

A chill ran down my spine. I wasn’t alone. Somehow, some way, this war had touched something else, another time, another battlefield. And we’d crossed into it, just for a moment.

The nurse came by and gently quieted the young soldier, giving him something to ease his pain. But as I lay back down, a thought took root in my mind, a deep, unsettling certainty.

We were part of something much bigger than we could ever understand. War wasn’t just tearing through our land; it was tearing through time itself, ripping men out of place, out of everything they knew, and leaving them lost.

As I drifted back to sleep, I wondered if I’d return to the jungle when I closed my eyes. Or, worse yet, if that distant war would come looking for us one day, finding us here in these tents, in this hell that seemed so endless. I wondered if I’d ever escape it, or if, somehow, I’d be fighting forever, lost in a cycle of battles that stretched beyond any time or place I could understand.

And as sleep overtook me, I swear I heard the faint sound of gunfire echoing in the distance, sharper and louder than any musket I’d ever known.

ExplainLikeImFive,ELI5 is looking for new moderators (in non-american time zones) to join our team!,"Hi Everyone,

If the general sentiment amongst laypeople seems to be that wages are too low, prices are too high, and many people across industries are having a hard time finding or keeping work, but we keep hearing from experts that the economy is good, what criteria are they using to evaluate it? Is that sentiment simply a false narrative laypeople are being fed, and wages, prices, and jobs have actually improved, or is the economic experience of the average person actually not a very good indicator of overall performance?

TrueOffMyChest,Want to fulfill all your wildest dreams? Become a Reddit mod!,"Picture this: You're soul searching in between jobs, enjoying the single life to discover your inner self and allowing your mother to live above you and all you ask her for in exchange is a daily delivery of dino chicken nuggies and a refreshing bottle of mountain dew. It all sounds perfect, right? So why does it feel like something's missing? Well look no further because we have the solution for you...

**Reddit Moderation!**

What could more perfectly complement your fulfilling lifestyle than playing internet cop on Reddit? See a post you disagree with? You can delete it! User making valid points and hurting your feelings in modmail? Mute them! Having a bad day? Just ban a random, unsuspecting individual!

`**Disclaimer for Mod Code of Conduct purposes: you can't actually do any of this`

On to more serious matters,

We are in need of more moderators to help maintain the subreddit. No experience is needed. All we ask is that you have the time, patience and a good sense of humor. Our team will be available to train you and answer any questions you have. Communication is a *must* and really, why wouldn't you want to talk to us? You'll be placed on a probationary period to start and we fully understand that mistakes will be made and activity may fluctuate. Please note that being selected as a mod does not guarantee you will be a permanent addition. Not everyone is a good fit and that's okay.

So what does moderating actually entail?

* Clearing the queue will be your #1 task. The queue is where you'll see any content that has been reported or our automod has flagged for review. All you have to do is go through it, read the content and decide whether to remove it, approve it and sometimes report or ban a user. The queue fills up *fast* and needs a lot of attention. Seriously, some of you need to lay off the spam reports.
* Modmail is your next task. It's mostly users asking why their post is missing (automod ate it 99% of the time) and asking that you fix it. We also recieve ban appeals here. If you're lucky, you'll get a death threat every now and then. Hooray! If any modmails are uncomfortable, too personal or upsetting to you, you can delegate it to another mod.
* Sometimes a post will come up that's especially spicy or attracting a lot of attention. When this happens, one of our mods likes to comb through the comments for violations or sit on it to monitor incoming comments for violations. If it gets too much to handle, or someone isn't available, you can lock it.
* Communicating with the team is one of the most important tasks in your role as a moderator. As a team, we discuss moderation actions, rule changes, sub events and the direction of the subreddit. That all sounds very boring but rest assured, there's a lot more casual talk than anything else so feel free to chime in on Beaver's dislike of garlic bread (encouraged), Tim sharing new sanrio drops or my Call of Duty K/D ratio.
* Lastly, let's talk about the meta. Sometimes things need doing on the sub, like this recruitment post I was supposed to make months ago. While the day to day is important, we also need to keep the sub up to date with new features and tools and update it to fit the growing userbase.

If you managed to get through all that, congrats! You made it to the actual app, which is also long and annoying. Here's a tip for applying: there is a short quiz portion to the app. We don't care if you get everything right, we just want to see your line of reasoning and understanding of the rules and subreddit culture.

[APPLY HERE](https://forms.gle/RwSTF7VQbPE4Djta9)

These apps are open indefinitely, and we will be doing staggered recruitment, so feel free to take your time.",107,0.9,74,BvbblegvmBitch,2023-12-27 00:24:23,18rtwhw
TrueOffMyChest,Reminder - We are not a political subreddit - Posts about the election will be removed.,"Rule 7 (Posts must be personal) still exists.

No, your hot takes about the election, whether celebratory or gloomy, are not what this subreddit is for.

No, you whining about how much you have to see posts about the election is not what this subreddit is for.  Also, you're playing yourself when you do that.

No, making a post titled ""WWIII"" to bypass the filter (which includes both Trump and Harris) won't convince us to leave your post up.

There are many, many places to talk about the election on and off of reddit.  This is not one of them.  We've had dozens, possibly hundreds of posts removed.  Given that nobody reads these pinned posts or the rules on the side, I expect we'll have dozens to hundreds more!

TrueOffMyChest,My husband got a blow job from a stripper at his brother's bachelor party,"*Background from my original post: My husband got a blow job from a stripper during his brother's bachelor party. I found out a few days later because he sent me a text  about it that was meant for his brother. My husband left work early to come home and delete it from my phone but I had already seen it. He played it off and told me nothing happened. A few days later his brother got married and after the reception my husband told me what he had done with the stripper. The day after the wedding he said he was making up nonsense because he had too much to drink at the reception. Several days after the wedding he came to me in tears and confessed that it was all true and he did get oral sex from the stripper. He tried to blame it on being drunk but he later admitted that he didn't drink as much as he pretended too and wasn't really drunk at either the bachelor party or the reception. The best man had apparently kept the groom away from any shenanigans with the strippers. The best man did not drink anything since he was the designated driver. The other men at the bachelor party (besides the groom, the best man and my husband) were single so they were not cheating with how they acted with the strippers. I was pregnant when this happened.*

I accepted that as good enough and figured I wouldn’t be able to talk her out of it. I kinda gave up without entirely moving on and that was the better part of a decade ago.

 Now, this year, she has been regularly hitting me up late at night suggesting we should meet up and go out like we used to.

She’s been with the same guy for like 8 years, I believe they’re engaged but not married.

TrueOffMyChest,Boyfriend couldn’t accept my child from my previous marriage,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 27F, and my boyfriend 25M and I recently broke up after many heartfelt conversations where he admitted he couldn’t see my son as part of his family. I’m struggling to process the end of our relationship and could really use some advice or support.

For context, I divorced my ex-husband when my son was only 8 months old. After that, I was completely celibate for 3 years before meeting my boyfriend. This relationship was my first since my divorce, and I truly thought we could build something lasting.

We were together for 9 months, and we spent every single day with each other during that time. I have a son from my previous marriage, and while my boyfriend and I had a lot of love between us, he always struggled with the idea of including my son in his family. I met his parents, siblings, and extended family, but whenever I suggested including my son, he made it clear he wasn’t comfortable. At one point, he even said my son could only meet his family when we were close to having children together—which I felt was unreasonable.

Eventually, he admitted he couldn’t move past the fact that I had a child and a marriage before him. He tried hard to overcome this because he loves me deeply, but he couldn’t, and he acknowledged that my son deserved better. I respect his honesty, but it breaks my heart.

I’m a mom first, and I know my son would eventually feel the rejection, which I can’t allow. So, we made the tough decision to end things. He believes I’ll find someone who can love and accept both me and my son fully, but it’s hard not to feel hopeless right now.

If anyone has been through something similar, how did you handle it? Did you find love again with someone who embraced your child as their own? How did you stay strong for yourself and your child during such a painful time?

Thank you for taking the time to read. Any advice or shared experiences would mean so much right now.

UnpopularOpinion,It’s ridiculous that people list every possible caveat whenever they make a statement.,"Example: “I personally love apples, but I know that some people are allergic to them, and others don’t like them!” This is absurd. Stop it. 

Example of the reasoning behind this behavior: “But the internet has no reading comprehension and I don’t want to get cancelled for being applephobic and pro anaphylactic shock!” 

Unfortunately, couching every statement, no matter how benign, in a bunch of qualifiers doesn’t guarantee that won’t happen anyway. Some people will inevitably misinterpret and get hung up on the caveats, or get mad about a caveat you DIDN’T include, and miss the point entirely.

“Unless you’re talking about a legitimately sensitive topic, just say what you mean already PLEASE.” An appropriate use of a caveat.

relationships,I've been LC with my (29F) dad (54M) for quite some time and he tried to open a can of worms by asking why am I LC with him.,"TLDR: I went LC with my dad after my mom passed and even more LC after my grandmother passed. This happened because he was quite an unsavory parent when I was a child. Recently, he reached out to me and asked why I don't talk to him and my brother anymore and I told him that that was a conversation I really didn't feel like getting into. He responded and I quote ""Wow, I never thought I did anything so egregious"" and I don't know where to go from here. 

  
The childhood I had was not rough but it also wasn't easy. My dad was the type of man to work 16+ hours a day to make sure that the family had everything we needed because my mom was disabled and couldn't work, but he also did some things that I don't think I'm allowed to mention in this subreddit. As soon as I was able to I left the house and started slowly breaking contact with my dad. After my mom passed from COVID, I stopped visiting home. After my grandmother (his mom) passed, I stopped visiting the state entirely because I had no reason to. I've been in therapy to try to work through some of the things, but it has been slow progress. 

  
All of this came to a head last week when I got a text from Dad randomly saying that ""Something wasn't right in his spirit"" and that I needed to message him quickly so he can know that me and my daughter are okay. I responded very courteously saying that we were fine and that everything is okay and tried to leave it there, but he started pushing. He brought up the fact that I've been estranged from him and my brother (who is exactly like him) for some years now and he just cannot understand why I don't reach out and talk to them like I used to. I tried to keep a level head and this is how I responded: ""All due respect dad but that is just not a conversation that I am ready to have at this point. This is a can of worms that I don't really want to open now. I'm sorry""

To which his response: ""Wow but okay. I didn't think that I did something that egregious to you that you would stop talking to me and your brother. But whenever you're ready we can talk about it. You're grown. I'm grown true, you're my daughter but we can have a civil conversation""

My concern is that there won't be a civil conversation. My father is the type of person who says ""I've been this way for 54 years and I'm not changing. You can deal with it or not"" and because of that I've chosen to not deal with it. But at the same time, him reaching out feels like a trap of some sort.

relationships,I [35M] Lost my job due to layoffs and my fiancée [F29] keeps calling me unemployed and useless. Any words of encouragement for me? I feel so low in life.,"It’s 1:07 am, as I drink my beer, let me share with you my story.

Was in a decent job. I did well. It paid me decently well and I loved what I did. I could sustain myself without depending on anyone.

Some background about me:

I come from a broken family ..alcohol, abuse, name calling you name it, I never wanted to stay home.

I struggled through my college days in Xavier’s Kolkata, surviving one meal a day. Sometimes if my friends shared their tiffin I ate else I just went out for a walk.

I used to walk everyday up and down to college to save 5 rs bus fare.

Somehow I got through graduation and with some hard work and luck I got into TISS Mumbai. Completed my studies on scholarships.

So coming back to my family, I wanted to move out and as soon as I got a decent job I Moved to Bangalore. I couldn’t bear the home environment anymore.

In Bangalore, I regained my health and career. Finally I could focus and excel at my job without much distraction.

All this while I never got into any relationship. I wanted to focus on my career and seek God.

And then, one fine day, I got a text from a girl on Instagram. I ignored it. Anyways I never believed in online love. But she was insistent, and I gave in. We started talking and soon enough we were in love.

Moreover by then I was 33, and since I didn’t come from a good family, no family ever wanted to marry their daughter to me so under pressure I thought why not give it a try?

We were in a long term relationship. And then we finally decided to meet up. We met and trust me on the very next day she started fighting me. I thought all women are moody and perhaps it’s nothing to worry about.

We stayed in long term relationship but kept meeting often, until one finally day she kicked me in anger. I was shocked.

As much as I was angry and upset, I let it go.

Then this happened again. This time it was in public she tore my tshirt.

She’s the kind of person whose mood would fluctuate every single minute. This is an exaggeration but you get my point.

She asked me for forgiveness, eventually I gave in. We were in love again.

I’m the meanwhile we were also engaged. Since I didn’t have a family, it was just an exchange of ring.

Also, I thought it might be wise to meet her parents. It was the right thing to do.

So I met them. Very beautiful family - her mom and dad. They came from a well to do family.

But as soon as I got back to Bangalore after meeting her parents, that Wednesday I lost my job. Some of us were laid off.

To add insult to injury, the very next week after being laid off, my father was hospitalised. So I had to go back to the family which I hated.

They never respected us and now all of a sudden they were dependent on their children. Long story short, he passed away. For about two months I wasn’t able to focus on my interviews.

It was a very tough period in my life and I’d have loved to receive some support from my now fiance.

You won’t believe me, but right after my dad passed away, in the next half an hour my fiance started a fight with me….”Fuck you and irresponsible” and what all she said just half an hour after my father passed away. She fought with me just because “I didn’t give her time” that day my father died.

I was shocked… she literally “fuckk youuud” me half an hour after my dad died.

Once I got back to Bangalore, she would be sweet some days and really cruel the other days.

I’m purposely using the word cruel.. like literally cruel!!!!

She’d keep calling me and reminding me that I’m unemployed whenever we fought.

She called me unemployed even when we didn’t fight. She’d say things like I was unemployed because I was cursed by God!

When I had interviews from good companies, I wouldn’t do well because i was so low in confidence. She wouldn’t even care. Just before my interviews she’d keep calling me useless and unemployed and how I’d not get a job etc..

And I don’t even want to get into the guys she used to talk to behind my back. We fought like cats and dogs. But she kept lying. I don’t even want to go there.

Anyways by Gods grace, today I’ve somehow managed to find a job after a wait of about 6 months.

TL;DR: Right now it’s exactly 1:25 am. Any words of encouragement or advice for me? Would greatly appreciate. I \[35M\] Lost my job due to layoffs and my fiancée \[F29\] keeps calling me unemployed and useless. Any words of encouragement for me? I feel so low in life. Feeling so low in life. My life is messed up. ",15,0.76,29,Quirky-Meat-6027,2024-11-15 15:03:17,1gs6nsb
relationships,My bf used to be in love with my bestfriend ,"

I’m a 27F and have been dating my boyfriend (28M) for three years now. We actually met four years ago, and before that, he was close friends with my best friend. They used to talk daily, but I didn’t know any of this until later. Around May four years ago, he confessed his feelings to her, but she rejected him. That same month, he started talking to me more and distancing himself from her.

He’s genuinely a kind, caring person, and though he wasn’t overly flirty, I sensed he liked me. After about eight months, he told me he’d once had feelings for my best friend but reassured me that his feelings for me were much stronger. By then, I had already fallen for him, he has so many qualities I admire. I initially rejected him, feeling like I might just be a rebound, but we decided to stay friends. Three months later, we couldn’t resist our connection and started dating.

A year into our relationship, I discovered he still had residual feelings for her. I found out twice, once at six months in, and again at twelve months, when he texted her a long apology for “ruining their friendship”. When I got mad he said he only wanted to make things right and that he couldn’t stand the thought of having hurt her( he knew from a mutual friend that she was feeling bad about losing him as a friend )

A couple of months later, he admitted he gave it much thought and he apologizes that he now believes he started liking me as a rebound, but he insisted that his feelings for me are genuine. These past three years have been emotionally difficult. I keep discovering more about how deeply he once cared for her, which leads to arguments and has made me feel incredibly insecure. I’ve even started taking SSRIs to help with the anxiety this has caused.

He’s broken up with me several times, saying he can’t handle the constant fights. I want to let go of the past and move forward, but he’s now given me an ultimatum: he only wants to stay together if I never bring up anything that bothers me. He says he’s had enough and won’t tolerate any more discussions or negativity. (To be honest he had been fairly patient with me, but he said he has reached a breaking point where he can’t take it anymore, because he simply can’t change the past and I just have to make peace with it)


I’m trying to make this work, but I feel conflicted, sad and confused….I need your advice on what to do?

TL;DR: I’m a 27F, dating my 28M boyfriend for three years. He confessed feelings for my best friend before we got together, and though he says his love for me is genuine, I’ve struggled with insecurity and anxiety over his past feelings for her. He’s broken up with me multiple times over these issues and now says he’ll only stay if I stop bringing up my concerns. I’m trying to move forward, but I feel conflicted and sad.

relationships,Should I (33F) tell my best friend that she (32F) hurt me by not really including me in her wedding?,"My best friend of almost a decade got married about a week ago. I thought we were mutually each other's best friends: turns out I didn't even make it into her top three. This is a person who I see regularly, who I have traveled with extensively outside the country, I've celebrated a lot of life events with, and who officiated my wedding last year (I didn't have a bridal party, so she was the only person that had a special role). 

Before I knew who her wedding party was, I had offered to do a reading, thinking I could return the favor for officiating our wedding. A couple weeks later, she asked me if I would do the reading and she said that would be great because she and her husband were deciding to keep the wedding party small. I was a couple drinks in, and it took me a second to realize that this was her way of saying I wasn't in the wedding party. I put on a good face, and thought, ""Hell, at least I'm involved, and I'm sure she'll make keep me involved in other ways."" I'm not a particularly traditional person, so maybe she figured I wouldn't care as much? Over the next year of planning, she didn't really include me, despite the fact that I offered help and expressed interest. I was feeling okay about the whole thing, but during the wedding, I found out that I wasn't invited to the rehearsal dinner, despite the fact that I would be doing something during the wedding. I had also asked that we also get a professional photo together so I could put it with one I had from my wedding. That didn't happen either.   
  
Needless to say, I'm baffled and saddened by the whole thing.  I'd like to pretend like I'm not hurt, but it's forced me to reevaluate a relationship that I considered on par with family. I went from thinking that this person was my ride-or-die, to feeling that she didn't want me around. Other people who know both of us are also confused and think it's weird. To be fair, their perception of our friendship could be biased by how I talk about it. My husband thinks I'm making a mountain out of a molehill, but he also doesn't have any close friendships that are anywhere as intimate as this. 

Should I bring this up to my friend, or should I just stay quiet and distance myself a bit? I can't imagine that much good will come of bringing it up this late, but I truly feel like I've been grieving a deep friendship that I'm realizing now may have been a bit one-sided. I didn't want to bring it up before the wedding because wedding planning is stressful and I didn't want to be the person in her life causing drama. So folks, WIBTA if I brought this up a month (or more) after the wedding? Does it feel like the benefits of gaining some clarity benefit the potential awkwardness that might come from it? 

*TL;DR! Best friend of almost a decade didn't include me as much in her wedding or wedding planning. It has changed my understanding of our relationship, and made me question if I've just been misreading signals that we're not as close as I thought we were. Should I talk to her about it now that the wedding's over, or just swallow my pride and grief and focus on building other relationships?*",177,0.91,136,_cryborg,2024-11-14 18:26:17,1grjoem
relationships,My (26f) husband’s (28) feet stink and I can’t stand it anymore. ,"I get that feet are *not* the cleanest part of the body and that they’re bound to smell sometimes. But Jesus Christ. 

For context: my husband works in a sawmill. He wears heavy work boots, which of course, make his feet sweat. 

He will often rewear pairs of socks he wore to work, sometimes wearing the same pair for 3 or 4 days. I’ve asked him not to do this because it smells so horrid I can’t deal with it. 

But even still that doesn’t matter. As soon as he comes home and takes his shoes & socks off, the smell is INSTANT and permeates the air. It even lasts after he takes a shower. And it doesn’t smell like just sweaty feet from a long day. Nonono. It legitimately smells like he has been walking around in a sewage tank and I’ve asked myself on several occasion if that’s what he’s really doing before he comes home. Because I just cannot fathom the smell and how it is THAT bad. 

I’ve tried to be nice to him about it before with little suggestions and he gets defensive and mopey. I try to be firm about it and tell him to wash his damn feet, same reaction. 

At this point I don’t know what else to do. I’m currently hiding in my bathroom because I cannot stand to be laying next to him as he sleeps AND stinks up the entire bedroom. 

We’ve been together almost 10 years and his feet have never *not* had a little odor to them but NEVER this bad.. 

TL;DR: my husband feet smell to the point I don’t want to be near him and he gets defensive when I mention it. What do??",453,0.92,155,wanderlustrousx,2024-11-14 01:24:21,1gqzi5n
relationships,Advice for stopping arguments?,"I (27F) have been married to my husband (26M) for 2 years now but we have been off and on since grade school. We have both dated other people, had our share of that, and came back together later when we were ready to settle down. We have always been super lovey in the way we communicate and treat each other. We had a son a few years ago and of course with a new baby brings new stress in a relationship. We tend to get along together fine on a day to day basis with no real bickering or issues, but when we do fight, it is so bad. 

My husband is usually very kind and caring, but over the last few years as our sex life has not been as active as usual (with the toddler, hormone issues, etc) he has started to lash out randomly and become very aggressive and extreme. We have had many arguments over our sex life as he does not feel like we have sex enough. At the worst of it, we may only have sex once a week or so which I feel like is not awful compared to some, but he sees it as me not wanting him. This is not the case at all and I try to reassure him each time he expresses these feelings, but I do understand how badly it can feel to feel unwanted. What I don’t understand is how he treats me sometimes. 

Randomly, he will have outbursts that seemingly come from nowhere. For example - tonight we have a good night together, a great day together, we were even texting earlier in the day about how much we loved and appreciated each other and how lucky we are for our family. We said our goodnights and I love yous and went to sleep. Around midnight, our toddler woke up crying. My husband jumped out of bed and grabbed his things and stormed out of the bedroom (this is unusual for him, as I work tomorrow and he stays home so typically he would help take care of our child). I came out to the living room to ask him if he was okay and he responded “I am so sweaty” I told him to turn the heat down and this is when he went off. He starting yelling at me, mocking me, and talking to me in a way that was not okay. He ended up slamming our bedroom door as well. This came from nowhere and the way he spoke to me and mocked me made me feel like it was borderline verbally abusive. Again this is just tonight’s example but this happens ever month or so. Sometimes he will curse at me, call me b****, or say fu** you. I have asked him to go to therapy or talk to a doctor about his anger issues. He started on a depression medication awhile ago and then randomly stopped taking it because he was “better” and refused to start it again. 

I know I’m probably rambling on but I’m just not sure what to do at this point. Everytime this happens I tell him that I can’t keep being treated this way and that I want to support him and get him help but if he won’t do it himself then there is nothing I can do. It makes me miserable but it doesn’t happen every day or even every week so I don’t know if this is normal and I am just being sensitive or what. I love my husband and I don’t want to split our family but I just feel like I deserve more than this and I wish he felt that way and would get help. 

How can I help support him to figure this out? Any advice on healthy ways to communicate this? ",4,0.84,3,Puzzleheaded_Gas_888,2024-11-15 00:34:23,1grqb2w

TrueAskReddit,Are we witnessing a power shift from west to east ? ,"In the far east, China's economy and geopolitical influence is constantly growing. They are getting bolder and bolder in challenging US hegemony and getting closer and closer in technology, military, economy etc. BRICS likewise is getting stronger with more members joining and recently their current attempt at dedollarization. Russia's offensive in Ukraine is still going strong and it seems American and EU support is only barely holding them. Both Iran and Russia have been hit with such sanctions yet they are holding fast and haven't collapsed despite the wars they are involved in. You also see rising economies and massive projects ranging from NEOM in Saudi Arabia to China's Belt and Road. 

Meanwhile, You see economic downturns and woes all across the West world. The Canadian housing crisis, while not getting tons of coverage, is now having a massive effect on both citizens and immigrants. The USA's internal political strife is of course on every screen. More and more countries seem to dislike the US and even some allies look elsewhere for economic and military opportunities. Global support for Israel because of the current war is shifting more and more towards the Palestinians fight for freedom. GenZ is reported to rank amongst the all time lowest in USA in terms of Israeli support and alignment. Brexit. The effect of Ukraine war on European economies that look to be waning.

TrueAskReddit,"Is it possible to shift human society from competition to collaboration, or is that just wishful thinking?","I’ve been wrestling with this idea lately: Could we, as a species, ever move away from a society driven by competition and shift towards one built on collaboration?

It seems like so many of our issues — from economic inequality to environmental destruction — stem from this relentless drive to “win” rather than to work together. But if we could change the foundation of how we operate, could we solve these problems more effectively?

TrueAskReddit,"Imagine undeniable evidence of Trump, Musk, and Starlink meddling in an election—how would Americans respond?","Imagine we discovered undeniable evidence of election manipulation involving Trump and his allies, with major figures like Elon Musk possibly in the mix. With Musk’s financial support for Trump in swing states, combined with his control over influential platforms like Starlink and X (formerly Twitter), the implications for election integrity could be huge.


Consider the scenario: Starlink’s vast satellite network may have vulnerabilities, particularly in areas where it could intercept or interfere with unofficial election transmissions. Add to this Trump’s history of preconditioning his supporters to distrust election results and his possible legal strategies to sidestep charges if re-elected.

When I was younger id always get bullied for some reason, I dont think I was that different from the other kids in my class but granted it was racism. I was in a russian school and im not russian (I moved to America) so it was mostly racism but still, my neighborhood wasn't that racist compared to my school and I would constantly get used for money or be picked at (id bring my pocket money to buy ice cream and just like a cartoon some neighborhood kids would threaten me if I didn't give them my cash, which I did lol). Which I DO get because I was easy to manipulate (obviously, I was 7). But now like when I was in middle and high school I would get picked on CONSTANTLY. By people I thought were my friends (not friends anymore). They were always lowk shitting on me 24/7 but I still stayed friends with them???

Confession,I took shrooms and realized how much I've been hiding from myself,"I never thought I'd end up writing this, but here I am, spilling my guts on reddit. I took shrooms last night---honestly, I don't even know what I was expecting. I've done them before, but something about this time... it was different.

Its like everything I've been keeping in the deepest corners of my mind finally burst out like a savage flood. The walls I've built around myself, the ones I thought were rock solid, melted away like butter on a hot stove. And what I found underneath was terrifying.

I've been so consistent at lying to myself. Lying about my happiness, lying about my relationships, lying about the things I love and hate. I've buried my true feelings so deep that even I didn't realize I was doing it. But under the influence of those shrooms? I couldn't escape the truth.

My belly, which I've hated for years, became the focal point of everything. It was like I couldn't stop thinking about how I've been using it to hide from myself. I thought if I made it smaller, if I controlled it, I'd feel in control of everything else. But instead, I just spiraled. The more I focused, the more I saw how empty I was, how empty everything felt.

I thought I'd come out of it with some new sense of peace or enlightenment, but instead, I just felt EXPOSED. There's nothing savage about it. It's the truth. And now, I'm left with a question that's im too afraid to face: What do I do with all this now? How do I go back to pretending when I've seen myself for what I really am?

I don't know how to deal with it. Maybe I'm just venting here, but I needed to share this. I feel like I've been forced to look into a mirror that I can't unsee.

Confession,"I Worked for a Major Food Delivery Service, and It Was Full of Scams. I Fought Back, and Here’s How That Went Down. ","Back in the day, I got hired as a customer service rep for a huge food delivery service. You know the kind—one of those apps everyone’s got on their phone. I wasn’t working directly for them; my company was contracted to handle all their customer service. At first, I was genuinely excited about the job. I actually felt proud to be part of something that, at least on the surface, seemed like it made people’s lives easier.

But pretty soon, I saw things that didn’t sit right. And by “didn’t sit right,” I mean I saw open scams happening every single day. It wasn’t just the occasional mistake or lazy customer service; it was full-on fraud being green-lit and ignored because everyone at the top was profiting.

Here’s how it went down: Some restaurants on the app were legit—others, not so much. These sketchy places knew exactly how to exploit the app's refund policies, almost like they had our internal guidebook memorized. They’d “accept” orders but not even bother making the food. Instead, they’d keep the line busy or let it ring. They’d wait long enough that when the delivery window passed, they could claim, “Oh, the food was made and delivered.”

And you know what’s worse? Some of these businesses were nearly untraceable for us CSRs. They’d found every loophole, and we basically had to take their word for it. People were paying with debit cards, so getting refunds was already a hassle unless you met certain criteria, criteria these scam restaurants knew to avoid like the plague.

At first, I tried to let it slide, thinking maybe I was wrong. But I wasn’t wrong. I saw so many customers being scammed, so I decided to step in and do something about it.

I started small, so no one would notice. I’d cancel orders I knew were scams, especially with places I’d flagged as frequent offenders. The “restaurants” would call in, furious, yelling at us for “system errors” they thought were cheating them out of their scam payday. I’d apologize with the most professional “Sorry, our system’s down for maintenance,” or another bullshit excuse they cannot pursue us for, and secretly enjoy the fact that they weren’t getting a single cent that day.

When I got away with that, I went a little further. I started shutting down scam restaurants for entire shifts. Sometimes I’d take them off the app completely while I was on duty. And guess what? Customers were actually happier—because the businesses that were left actually delivered real food. Everyone benefitted, except the scumbags at the top and the businesses taking advantage of people. And I felt like I was actually doing the job they’d hired me for, just with a little more backbone than they’d bargained for.

But my luck ran out eventually and upper management noticed something was off. They didn’t have hard evidence, but they could tell that someone was making changes and it was always during my shift. They didn’t even question me—they just fired me on the spot. I didn’t get a chance to explain, and honestly? I don’t think they would’ve listened and would have probably made things worse for me. It was easier for them to fire the “problem” than address the massive issue of fraud happening on their app.

Would I do it again? Honestly… yeah, but I’d probably be a little smarter about it. Do I regret it? Kind of, but also, no. What I did wasn’t “right” by the book, but sometimes you have to go off-script. I just wish the thousands of people still getting scammed every day had someone on their side willing to stand up against these crooks.

I didn’t walk away with a clear conscience, but I walked away knowing I did something. And maybe that’s enough.",97,0.91,43,amberazanu,2024-11-14 19:11:11,1grkl9l

Stories with jokey punchline will be removed. We shouldn't be laughing at the end of the story. Stories dealing with depression, suicide, mental illness, medical ailments, and other assorted topics belong over on /r/ShortSadStories. However, this doesn't mean you cannot use these topics in your stories. There's a delicate balance between something horrifying and sad. If we can interpret the story as being scary, we will do so. 

Please note that badly written stories, don't necessarily fall under this category. The story can be terrible, but still be focused on horror.

**No Plagiarism** 

All stories must be an original work. Stories written by AI are not allowed. Stories must be submitted by the authors who wrote the story. Do not steal other users' stories. No fan-fiction allowed. Repeat offenses will result in a ban. If someone can find your story somewhere else, it will be removed. This rule also applies to famous or common stories that you’ve merely reworded slightly. This does not apply to famous stories you’ve reworked considerably, such as a fresh take on a fairytale or urban legend. The rule of thumb is that the more you alter the text to make the story your own, the more lenient we’ll be.

**Rape/Pedophilia/Bestiality/Torture Porn/Gore Porn are Off-Limit Topics**

The intent of this ban is to prevent bad actors from exploiting this sub as a delivery system for their fantasies, which would bring the tone down, and alienate the reader base who don’t want to be exposed to such material. We acknowledge that this ban throws out the baby with the bath water, as well-made stories that merely happen to have such themes will get removed as well. But if we let in the decent stories with such content, those bad actors can point at them and demand to know why those stories get to stay and not theirs. Better by far to head the issue off entirely with a hard ban and stick to it.

**24 Hour Rule**

Authors must wait 24 hours between submissions. This is intended to prevent prolific writers from crowding out others from the front page by spamming the sub. It is likely if you mistime it, you’ll be able to copy/paste and resubmit your story once the 24 hours has passed.

**Exceptionally Poor Quality Stories May Be Removed** 

We reserve the right to remove any story that fails to use proper grammar, has frequent typos, or is in general just a poorly composed story. This is relative, and we will use that right as sparingly as possible. Walls of text will automatically be removed.

ShortScaryStories,My New Neighbors Are Vegans And They Won’t Shut Up About It.,"I moved into my house six months ago. It was a no-brainer - it was far enough away from the city to have some peace and quiet but close enough to visit when necessary, trees provided good shade in the summer, and the rent was cheap. It was perfect. 

Then my new neighbors moved in. Typical yuppie idiots - moved out of the city but brought the city with them. Drove a Tesla and drank kale smoothies. And gardened. 

I tried to ignore them, but they began to ruin everything. They constantly blasted their crap modern music, disrespected the local shop owners, threw parties that brought strangers to the previously-quiet neighborhood. And they kept taking up more and more space with their noxious eyesore of a garden, raising herbs and vegetables to eat as part of the ridiculous “environmentally-friendly” vegan cooking they wouldn’t stop talking about. Christ, that garden turned my stomach. The lights, the sounds, the smells - I hated it all. And I began to hate them.

So I started asking them nicely to tone it down - to turn down the lights, quiet the music, be considerate of their neighbors and the place they’d moved to. But they ignored me - “we bought this place and we’ll live as we choose.” Then I proceeded to asking less nicely. I left notes on their car and door, filed noise complaints with the local police, rallied the other neighbors against them. But I was new here, and they had lots of money to throw around, so my efforts went nowhere. They even filed a complaint with the police against *me*, if you can believe it! Said I was *harassing* them. They had no idea what harassment was. 

This went on for weeks, getting progressively worse - the noise and lights and smell driving me insane. Then they crossed the line. 

I was enjoying a quiet night in when lights came on and shone directly into my living room. And when I looked out of my window, one of them had the nerve to look back at me and *smirk.* Smirk! Like I was some country bumpkin they’d put in his place. 

I’d had it. I got up and marched over to their house, seething and determined to end this. I banged on the door until it opened. 

“Oh, it’s you.”

“Yes, it’s me,” I replied. “The neighbor whose life you’ve been making hell since you moved in. We need to talk.”

“About what?” he asked. “How you’ve been harassing us? We’ve already filed a complaint.”

“Yes, I know. I was hoping we could resolve this over tea like civilized people.”

He stared at me. “Fine, come in, let’s talk.”

As he closed the door behind me and started toward the sitting room, I ejected my fangs and plunged them into his neck, savoring the tangy taste of blood that flowed from him like a torrent, ruined only by one lingering scent. 

“For Christ’s sake, enough with the FUCKING GARLIC!”

ShortScaryStories,Recourse for the Wrongly Convicted,"Alex knew the name of the man who had *actually* murdered his daughter.

He had never met the man. There was no connection between them, no reason Alex could give as to why he was the real killer. Alex sounded insane - even to himself.

So he went to prison. 

—

Alex was released 40 years later, at the age of 70. The deathbed confession of the actual murderer had caused a witness in the case to recant their testimony, admitting to fabricating their claims.

Alex had been right about the killer’s identity the entire time.

Fate didn’t care, though, and had kept piling on. Two months before his release, Alex had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. He had mere months to live. 

Trillionaire Eric Granger was determined to change that. 

—

Eric Granger, CEO of the world’s most powerful corporation, had heard Alex’s story.

He wanted to make that story right. 

—

Granger’s company had developed something that the world didn’t know about. *Couldn’t* know about yet. 

 A time machine. 

“We can’t give you your life back,” Granger told Alex. “Changing the past could have reality-shaking consequences on the present.

“We *can* send you to the future though.”

Alex wasn’t sure why he would want to go. Just to see it, he supposed? The cancer would kill him any day now.

Granger smiled. “Cancer gets cured in a hundred years.”

—

The machine looked like a photo booth - a small seat, curtains on either side. 

As it turned on, an unusual smell began to emanate. The smell was unlike anything else in the world. 

Yet, it felt familiar to Alex. Like something one might find in a childhood home revisited in adulthood. 

—

“I’ll be dead when you wake up. A hundred years for me, a quick nap for you,” Granger yelled over the machine. 

Alex wondered why Granger didn’t travel to a point in the future when whatever killed him had been solved by science.

All he could come up with was that maybe the time machine didn’t have the kinks worked out yet. 

It wasn’t a comforting thought as he drifted into sedation.

—

Alex awoke, groggy. 

*Is this…?*

His hands…they were wrinkle free. He was so young…

Alex looked around, and found himself in a small cell that he knew well. 

He screamed as the realization of what had happened set in. 

After a moment, though, it was all gone. The deathbed confession, the time machine, nearly everything. 

The only thing he retained was the name of his daughter’s actual killer. 

*That* he knew, for some reason. 

He would remember that name for the next 40 years, sharing it with anyone who would listen, though no one believed him. 

—

Some nights he dreamed of the time machine’s smell, even though he didn’t know what it was.

He dreamed he was flying across a dark night sky, the smell both guiding him home and leading him astray. 

A smell from his distant past, a smell from his distant future.

ShortScaryStories,I sneaked into my daughter's room and found something bad,"In the hush of noon, when the world stood still,  
I crept into her room, feeling a thrill.  
With grades to check, just a quick little peek,  
To see how she fared, for her future’s sake.  

I opened the drawer, expecting to see  
Papers and projects, her bright history.  
Instead of pencils, atlases and maps

A severed finger lay, carefully wrapped.  

My breath caught tight, confusion and fear,  
What did this mean? How did it end up here?  
Thoughts raced through my mind, a whirlwind of dread,  
Images flickered of things left unsaid.  

Was it a prank, my mind was at war

Or a sign of malice, bullying gone too far?  
I glanced at her books, her photos on display,  
Wondering what secrets had led her astray.  

Each moment stretched thin as I stood in the gloom,  
A father’s heart heavy, sensing impending doom.  
What questions to ask, what path should I tread?  
The innocence lost, like a ghost in my head.  

I closed the drawer, my mind in a spin,  
The weight of her secrets now pulling me in.  
When she came home, how would I cope?  
With a severed finger and fraying hope.  

In that quiet room, where dreams used to thrive,  
I wrestled with love, and how to survive.  
For shadows can creep, and darkness can bind,  
And in that moment, I felt the divide.",70,0.96,2,vincidelaunc,2024-11-15 10:58:22,1gs0y4a

ShortScaryStories,"In 2014, I boarded a train. It's been 10 years and I still haven't reached my destination. ","An embarrassing amount of time passed before I realized something was wrong.

I had made this train journey almost daily for over two decades and could tell by muscle memory now when the brakes would screech and the doors would open. And yet it hadn’t happened yet.

I checked my watch. It displayed 4:15. *That’s odd. We definitely should have stopped somewhere by now.* 

I looked out the window to try and discern where we were. I only studied the passing landscape for a few seconds before my brain began to scream at me, signalling that there was something *wrong* with what I was looking at. I couldn’t make out any particular shapes outside. It seemed as if the landscape had been reformed into a singular blob of mass and color.

Nothing that I was looking at resembled *anything* that I had seen before. 

I stood up and made my way to the end door of the carriage, trying to see if the other carriages were experiencing the same problem. It was locked.

What’s more, after peering through the carriage window, I saw nothing but the swirling colors around us. It was as if our train was connected to nothing. 

It was as if we were alone. 

I heard the sound of yelling and glass breaking from behind me. I spun around and saw a couple passengers crowding around a man standing on one of the chairs, looking towards the now-open window.

“You’re seeing this too, right?” He called out, his voice queasy. “This shit ain’t *real.*”

No one replied. 

“I can’t do this man. I don’t know what’s going on!” I could see fire burning in his eyes, his hair whipping around due to the draft.

As he looked outside the open window, I saw a strange calmness settle over him. He had resigned himself to this fate, whatever it was. He took a deep breath. And jumped. 

His jump seemed to have very little momentum.

Instead, as soon as his entire body left the train carriage he froze into place. He was still for a blissful second, before he *separated* before our eyes. Every piece of him disjoined from each other, and he was left frozen in place as billions of molecules vaguely resembling a person.

And yet he was still *alive*. 

Or at least I gathered from the screams that emanated from him. Panicking, I fell to the ground, cupping my ears with my palms, trying to escape the raw, guttural sounds that pierced my head. 

It was the sound of death from someone who could not die. 

I’m not sure how long it’s been since I made the mistake of boarding this train. None of us passengers have aged, or eaten, or done anything that is usually recognized as being required for survival. Sometimes we pass the passenger outside, still frozen in time, like a lighthouse of solidity in a sea of shapelessness.

And the worst part?

We always hear him before we see him. ",306,0.99,10,ineedabettertitle,2024-11-14 20:23:59,1grm00n
ShortScaryStories,My mum draws a picture every day on my lunch bag. They have gotten progressively more worrying.,"
It’s a habit she’s had since I first started kindergarten. 
Back then, it would be my favourite cartoon characters colourfully drawn in scene, cute quotes and words of encouragement. 

As I entered my teens, the colours tapered off a bit and the drawings seemed to reflect my teenage moody self, a lot of deep purples, blacks and whites were used to create scenes of stormy weather, ocean waves and rollercoaster rides.

Honestly id mostly forgotten about the lunch bags. 
I’m not a teen, certainly not a child anymore. 
I hadn’t had a packed lunch in years. Hadn’t thought about the drawings.

But recently, my luck changed. I was fired from work, my fiance left me the same week.
Suddenly I found myself back at my mother’s home, sleeping in my small childhood bed, surrounded by posters and stale memories.

Weeks passed, and on my first day at my new job, mum presented me with a packed lunch. 

When I got my break at lunchtime, seeing my mother’s drawing of a man dressed in a suit, briefcase in hand, a large grin on his face. “Have a happy day, son!” Mum had written in bright green marker.

It’s been a couple months now. I like my new job. I enjoy living with mum. But things have gotten.. strange.

I started noticing the drawings on my lunch bag were becoming.. odd.

Last Tuesday, for instance. I took out the paper bag, ready to enjoy my salami salad roll, to be greeted by carnage. 

Black and red scribbles, the writing mostly intelligible, apart from one sentence I could make out “help me”

I went home sick, even though I wasn’t technically unwell, I was sick with worry. But when I got home mum was fine, sitting on the porch staring off Into the woodlands, and when I asked her about it she just gave me a small smile and shrugged it off.

The rest of the week the drawings got more vulgar, more graphic. I have tried to talk to mum about it. She’s been locked in her room most of the week, only leaving to pack me a lunch every day, it seemed. She will not come out when I knock. 

I tried to brush it off. Tried to find explanations.

By the next Friday, the drawing was simple. There were no unreadable words, no messy scribbles.
A detailed sketch of a Single gravestone under a willow tree. My name, in delicate cursive, carved into the tombstone.

I left work immediately, and got home to an empty house. It took a while, but after pleading with mum to be let in, only to be met with silence, I took matters into my own hands and busted down the door to her bedroom
I’m not sure how long she has been dead for but her mummified state tells me it’s been a while. 

I don’t know who has been drawing on my lunch bags lately, but I know it wasn’t my mother.

ShortScaryStories,The Upstairs Couple's Kids Keep Dying,"Clarence and Jamie Wilson. Unit 206. 

6 children in the last 9 years. Most of them have lasted for less than 5 months. 

It has always looked suspicious. Rumors of poisoning, shaken baby syndrome, or outright neglect have circled around them for years. But none of them have ever been proven true. 

No doctor has ever been able to find a cause for so many deaths. Each baby presents differently. One with multi-organ failure, another with fatal pneumonia, most recently a neonatal stroke. There has never been shred of evidence to suggest neglect, nothing to indicate they have ever inflicted any harm onto their children. 

Some consider it immoral to bring a child into this world knowing they will likely suffer the same fate. Jamie believes it is her only choice.

Jamie lays little Jeffrey down in his crib. He is only 3 months old. A small tear streams down her face as she watches him break out into a coughing fit, quickly turning blue. Respiratory failure. She knows he stands no chance. Jamie lets out one deep sob and leaves him there. 

She walks down the hall into Kayla’s room. Kayla lays in her usual position, the oxygen mask glued to her face. Based on the severity of her cystic fibrosis, the doctors predicted that she wouldn’t live past 6. Yesterday, they celebrated her 12th birthday. 

Jamie knows she is only buying time. 

How many souls are worth the life of one child? It is not for me to decide. As long as she keeps her end of the bargain, I will continue to oblige. 

I watch Jeffery take his last breath, and grant Kayla another year of life.",1073,0.99,13,Feeling_Sky_7775,2024-11-14 10:54:31,1gr9bbj

ProRevenge,"Neighbor was stealing water from my supply, so I ruined him.","I live in Asia, and just purchased a new house. Now, the previous owners were family friends who needed cash urgently and haven't been living in my country for nearly 3 years. So I got it for a great price in the middle of the capital city.

The sale was finalized at the start of this month and I moved in right after. The house was definitely a fixer upper, as the previous owners had left mid renovation and the main door was locked with just a padlock, not even a door lock. 

The house had no gate, meaning anyone could just walk right on in. The first day I moved in, someone's bike was parked in the garage. I just parked it on the road on the same day I had a gate installed. An angry man was knocking on my gate later and I didn't bother answering, but through my window I could see him giving up and taking the bike after 15 minutes. 

So already, I wasn't digging the neighborhood. But I didn't have any incidents after that, aside from people not knowing that this was no longer an abandoned house, so my gate was blocked more often than never but a ""No Parking"" sign on my gate fixed that issue. 

Last week, I was having a shower in my bathroom and I noticed my water pressure was lower than usual. I also heard my next door neighbors water pump going. Now this neighbor, an old guy, lived in a 3 storied house, the first being the lowest and the one he lived in. The other two floors were rented out to tenants. 

This guy wasn't happy about the house being sold, and voiced many concerns to my friends the previous owners. He was super angry about it, and my friends did warn me but I'm a 6ft guy with 3 dogs. No way he was doing anything and yep, he didn't. 

So with this living situation, a water pump is needed to pump water to the tanks on the roof, since the public supply's pressure is not enough to get it up 3 stories. 

Now, I heard the water pump going and immediately was suspicious. Sure, coincidences exist, but it wouldn't hurt to check it out. I waited till his pump turned off, and then turned on different taps in the house. Sure enough, the pressure was back to normal. 

This made me even more suspicious, but if he was stealing water, it also made sense. The water bills had been going up over the years this house wasn't lived in, but the house also had some water leaks. So it was chalked up to that, even if the bills were too high to be caused just by leaks. Now it's starting to make sense. 

At some point in the last 3 years, this old miser thought he'd save the cost of paying for water, and waltzed into the property and is siphoning water from my lines. I couldn't find where exactly he was siphoning water from, but after checking my pressure multiple times, I was pretty sure.

So I sat on it for a few days, thinking if I should confront him, go the legal path or just let it be. Now, water in my country is very cheap. My total bill, even with washing 3 animals, a car every week and watering my garden only cost like $5 per month, even with the neighbor also stealing some of it. 

But it wasn't about how much I was paying or who was paying for it. It's about entitled old people who think that they're deserving of using other people's resources without paying for it, and then getting away with it. It didn't sit right with me, and I really wanted to teach him a lesson. 

What I did was really simple. I just turned off my water from the mains. I wouldn't have to break into his property, nor would I be breaking any laws. It was the best way of getting back at him without needing to even lift a muscle. 

So on Monday, just 4 days ago, I waited till the pump flicked on, and turned off the supply. Now, the way household tanks work in my country, is that there's a ball valve in the tank which detects the level of water and turns on the pump. If the level doesn't increase, the valve stays open which electronically sends a signal to the pump to stay on until the level gets to a point at which the valve closes and also shuts off the pump. 

However, the level wasn't increasing and anyone knows that starving a pump of water isn't a good idea. This way, my expectation was that I'd burn out his pump and cause issues with his tenants. 

What I didn't account for is that his pump running constantly would mess up the fuses by constantly drawing power overnight and absolutely destroy his wiring. If he decided to upgrade his household wiring to a more modern standard, this would've been prevented. This house clearly still had 90s era wiring. 

At around 3AM, I heard all residents in the house waking up and talking in hushed voices about why just their house in the neighborhood doesn't have power or water. I found out about the power part, because the tenants devolved into shouting at their landlord. 

Our tenant protection laws are very important, and power and water are classed as essential even on a state level. Cutting those services are grounds for lawsuits, unless due to weather or some other unavoidable reason. 

In this case, the landlord is responsible for keeping the house wiring up to date and in good condition, alongside the supply of water. So the tenants were not happy and one of them immediately moved out two days later when it was informed that water and power will not be returning the very same day this happened. 

Both tenants in the two floors lodged a complaint with the police, and if a person is in clear breach of laws, the police have the authority to fine or penalize the person without a court judgment. It can be challenged in court if the person thinks that they were unfairly penalized, but they still have to pay the fines and will only be refunded if and when the court finds the fines unlawful.

So now, the landlord lost both tenants and has to pay a fine of $500, which is a lot of money in our country. He also has to refund the security deposits of both tenants, and cannot rent out until both issues are fixed, which will cost him more money. 

As of right now, he's moving out on Sunday to his daughter's place since he cannot afford to live alone. The tenants were his only source of income, and he's a retired mechanic, so he has no other income. 

He did find out why the motor kept drawing power, overloaded the wiring and burned out. He came by to my gate and asked me if I turned off my water, and I said ""oh yeah, my tank had a new leak on a pipe and I turned it off till the next day until the plumber came by to fix the issue"".

Y'all, the look on his face. He kept a straight one, but I just knew he was holding back. He just said ""oh okay"" and went back inside. Not sure if he knows I know, but I don't care because he can't do anything. 

I'm getting a plumber down next week to correct my plumbing and remove any pipes that leave my property. So I got rid of my water issue and a neighbor who could potentially be a pain in the ass, by simply flicking a tap off. Two birds one stone I'd say.

ProRevenge,"If you're gonna steal the catalytics off my truck you should've checked if they were actually functional first, wasn't so funny when it was turn.","Was a fun morning at the beginning of last week starting up my truck and waking everyone up at 2:45am to learn someone swiped the hollowed out cats. The idiots missed the neighbors cameras that basically gave away who they were. Its two kids from the area who drive around in a pretty busted up police crown vic. I chose not to call the cops, instead I called one of my friends who's code enforcement and let him know what my plan was and he relayed the info to the police that I was finally going to do a nuisance tow on that same crown victoria 


The car they drive isnt street legal as it has no license plates or insurance or working taillights and rattles like shit due to the trash sound system they also spend their whole day at a chicken shack smoking. Not sure who theyre getting money from but I'm guessing stealing catalytics was part of the equation. When I spotted the car sitting on a quiet street I called it in and got the go ahead to tow. I took it straight to the police station and they tried to run a owner check with the vin number only to find out it hadn't been registered since 2011 and the owner was someone other than the kids who sold them the car with no title because of all the back registration  owed 


 The cops said we can go ahead and take it to the junkyard til they can get a Black title(aka certificate of destruction). By then the two idiots were running around all over town looking for their car thinking it got stolen by one of their friends as a prank(the key lock was so worn out you could start it with any car key). They found it at the junkyard and tried to steal it by one of them distracting the owner and the other stealing their car but the junkyard was aware of who they were so they cut the driveshaft off beforehand.

ProRevenge,Tricking My Slacker Coworker into Sabotaging Himself,"I work in an office with a guy I’ll call “Seth.” Seth is that coworker everyone knows: lazy, always passing his work onto someone else, and somehow always getting away with it. He’ll sit around on his phone or go to the bathroom every 10 minutes. He’s the kind of guy who will show up late, make some lame excuse about traffic, and then disappear for “lunch” for two hours.

For the past six months, Seth’s favorite target has been me. He’ll send emails asking if I can “help out” with a project, but what he really means is, “do all the work while I take the credit.” I complained to my boss a couple of times, but somehow Seth always managed to weasel his way out of trouble. The final straw came when he passed off a major report that was due to a client in two days, dumping it on me last minute.

One day I casually asked him if he was good with Excel, and he admitted he didn’t know much about it. Perfect. The next time Seth tried to dump a bunch of spreadsheets on me to organize for his next report, I agreed. But this time, I embedded a series of *hidden formulas* into the documents. These formulas didn’t do anything important, just enough to mess with the numbers if someone didn’t know how to check for hidden cells. It took me a little time, but I was careful not to make it too obvious. The kicker? Every time Seth tried to copy and paste the data into his report, it would scramble everything just enough to be completely useless.

On the day the report was due, Seth slacked off like usual, assuming I had handled it like always. When the client called, furious because the report was filled with nonsense numbers, Seth panicked. He rushed to fix it, but every time he tried to fix one part of the report, something else would break. He came to me, frantic, and asked for help. I acted confused and said, “Oh, I don’t know what happened! Maybe it’s a glitch?” I gave him some vague advice and watched as he spent the entire day trying to salvage his mess.

ProRevenge,Oh I played the long game ,"I am by no means an expert, or pro, at revenge but I am a patient person. I disclosed this to a friend and they directed me here. ThrowAway for obvious reasons, it's a long read but the setup and backstory are important.

7 years ago I was lucky enough to be able to buy my own place, I had saved for 10 years, worked my ass off, and I was so happy to be able to have a place to call my own.

Now, being a single person on the mortgage meant I had to make compromises, one such compromise was buying a property on a shared block (a lot cheaper). Where I'm from this usually means it's on a ""strata"" title. For some that's a bonus as it means there's a communal fund for repairs, typically insurance is cheaper as it's collective, and other things like maintenance being taken care of. Strata titles also come with a lot of by-laws and restrictions on what you can and can't do. I'm a pretty private and introverted person so having to deal with people and have limits on how I live was a no-no.

I took my time, found the perfect property. Shared block but freehold title. Only thing that was I needed to pay public liability insurance for the shared walkway on the property (split equally between owners). The real estate agent is local to my area, there's also about 3-degrees of separation between us, he has friends who are friends with my friends type of thing, didn't know him, but knew of him, so that sorta felt good too.

About 5 months after I move in I get a knock on the door from the owner (landlord) of the property next to me to discuss insurance. Not a problem, I ask for a copy of the policy so I have a record. It gets sent through and low and behold it's for strata insurance. I was incredibly confused and after much back and forth the property isn't a free hold title but a strata title. I called my lawyer who conveyed the title etc. He was dumbfounded but over it all did the right thing and made things as right as they could.

I arranged for a meeting with the real estate agent. I brought emails and printouts of the adds they had all saying it was free hold, emails between the real estate agent and my lawyer discussing it's freehold status, despite it being in absolute black and white he refused to accept any fault or offer anything to make things right. I don't begrudge that, he's looking out for himself, I get that. However I wouldn't forget it.

I did enter into mediation with the real estate agent and all I asked for was, when the time came for me to sell, they'd do it or cover the costs. I thought this was reasonable, but they flat out refused offered me 1k to go away, which I refused. I had the option to pursue them legally (and was advised by the mediator to do so) but ultimately I decided against it for a few reasons, the main one being my health at the time.

So I planned and plotted, and I schemed and connived as to how to get back at this son-of-a-bitch. And I settled on this.

I found his personal facebook page which wasn't set to private, saw some photos of a ""Boys on Tour"" trip he went on a few weeks prior (so about 5-6 months after I bought the property). I also found his address through a business registration search. On the anniversary of the sale, for 6 years straight, I sent them flowers with a note :-

""Dear Real Estate Agent  
Remembering you, on this, our special day.  
She has your eyes.  
Love Elle""

They varied ever so slightly over the years but always had ""on this our special day"" and some weird inference to a love child and a desire to reconnect.

I also from time to time arranged for postcards and letters to be sent from another country, the one he was ""On Tour"" in, always signed ""Love Elle"".

I learned about 3 weeks ago that this guy had recently divorced, lost his home and is not longer working as a real estate agent. His wife had found out he cheated on her. The story I was told (through said friends of friends) went along the lines of ""He would get weird gifts and flowers every year, same day, every year. She (his wife) finally put two and two together and realised what the date was and he admitted to cheating on her"".

Now, I didn't mean for this, but it turns out a year before I bought my house he had gone on holiday, came back with an STD, gave it to his wife but somehow convinced her that it wasn't him. As such ""our special day"" turned out to be right around the time he'd have been balls deep, sans condom, in someone who wasn't his wife, only one year earlier.

NuclearRevenge,Reminder: Criteria For User Comments,"Hello! This is a reminder to remain respectful when leaving comments or sending messages to other users or our mod team.

Recently, we had to lock a few posts due to a lot of misbehavior in the comments. Eventually, we decided to unlock them after clearing up the comments. Do not make us regret this decision.

While I’m at it, I might as well provide some criteria for leaving comments in general. 

**So, what kind of comments are allowable?**

• Compliments
• Questions
• Respectful Criticism/Observations (this helps us review posts)

**Now, what kind of comments are not allowable?**

• Insults
• Rude Criticism
• Wasteful/Low Effort Comments (that don’t contribute whatsoever)

**What about miscellaneous comments that are unrelated to the post?**

• We will decide to approve or remove these kind of comments at our own discretion. But most of the time, it should be fine. 

As a side note: In most cases, bad comments are simply removed with no further action. But in some cases, users may also be banned. 

FYI: In case of ban bypassing, we do observe posts and comments made by new accounts. This is an alternative to restricting the new accounts entirely.

•••

If you have questions regarding any of this then feel free to ask.

Thanks,

NuclearRevenge,Revenge on a hacker,"One day I get an email from a hosting provider telling me that attacks are being launched from our server and I need to look into it.

I find that there is indeed a hacker in our server. He was using an app to anonymously control his bot network, among other things.

I looked at the app he was using, and discovered that it was an opensource project. I then downloaded the code for this backdoor, modified it to log everything to a file, and replaced his app with my honeypot version.

Over the next six months I collected every scrap of information I could on this guy. I then used that information to take over many of his online accounts, including his main email account. That was the account where he had registered all of his services to, so I was able to issue password reset requests for everything he owned. I gained control of six other email accounts, two dozen IRC accounts, his facebook page, his dating profile, numerous websites, and the backup site he used for his cell phone. I have his phone number, his moms number, and his girlfriends number. I know his address, his birthday, the schools he went to, even his favorite foods and music.

After I took every single online account he had ever had away from him, I sent a nasty email to his ISP in an effort to extort yet more information from them. In that email I said some very unkind things about the monarch of Indonesia and how I might smear the monarch publicly if I didn't get the information.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The hacker dispeared immediatly after that. I have looked for him at times over the last fifteen years since and he has not resurfaced. The Indonesian lèse-majesté laws regarding insults to the monarchy are not to be trifled with. The prison term for such an offense is 15 years.",1920,0.95,94,DavesPlanet,2024-09-30 19:00:05,1ftajvn

NuclearRevenge,Revenge on an animal abuser ,"One day I was on my evening walk with my dog and we came across a small dog standing in the middle of the street shaking. It’s hair was matted, had mange, ridden with fleas, one eye swollen and sealed shut with mucus, nails so long it was walking on the back of its paws, malnourished, and quivering. I was shocked. 

I called my wife to bring me a blanket and come pick us up. While I was waiting, the door of the house in front of us opened, and out came a disheveled looking older man. He started calling for the dog to come inside. I absolutely lost it. I screamed at him asking if it was his dog and he replied it was. I asked him why it was in such bad shape and he said “she’s sick and won’t eat”. I yelled at him there was no fucking way in the world I was letting him take her back inside. The shouting match lasted long enough for a few neighbors to come outside. (Who later told me he had another dog in the house). Eventually my wife pulls up and I wrap the doggo in the blanket and go home. 

I looked up the name of our local no kill shelter but they were closed until the following day. My wife and I decided to call her Sally. I gave Sally a bath and went and bought some wet food since she wouldn’t eat dry kibble. She devoured it. I set her up a nice sleeping area in the garage for her to spend the night. 

1st thing in the morning I took Sally to the shelter and called animal control and told them what happened. They went to check her out, took a statement from me, and ended up at his house confiscating his other dog. Unfortunately Sally was put down due to the horrible shape it was in (she was also very old). 

Here’s where the revenge begins. 

This old assholes house was on the route I took to walk my dog twice a day. My dog liked to take a dump about two houses before we reached his. Perfect! Now I didn’t need to carry bags of shit all the way back to my house! I started tossing them on his roof twice a day. At first he would climb a ladder around once a week to get them down, but eventually I broke his will to do that. This went on for about a year before I moved. His roof was covered in shit bags. 

I also printed out flyers with his address and pictures of how I found Sally and put them in all the neighbors mailbox’s. 

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
I live across town now, but every couple months I ride by and toss a bag of dogshit on his roof to let him know I’m still thinking about Sally. ",1404,0.95,43,BalloonKnotBandit,2024-09-22 18:24:32,1fn6ndp

LifeProTips,LPT: Use moving as an excuse to quickly cancel any service/utility provider over the phone with haggling agents. ,"I first did this (without lying) when I moved out of my college apartment but it has proved to work wonders since. My apartment had all utilities included in the monthly rent. But you did have to set up WiFi through a specific provider and give them the exact address so it could be billed properly, and call to cancel upon moving out. It was a quick, easy, cancellation, but figured it was a fluke since they’re familiar with the complex. 

I had to call and cancel WiFi services about 2 years ago, since I moved to my current house. This time, so much haggling. I finally just lied and said I was moving out of state and gave them a zip code I know they don’t provide to since I was so annoyed. It was only then that he relented and cancelled my service. 

So fast forward to now, me and my housemates  are switching WiFi services since we can get ridiculously better speeds for the same price as our old provider. When I called to cancel, I plainly said “I’m moving to a housing complex that requires us to use a specific service provider that isn’t you.”

And boom. No haggling. No “well would you like to stay with us for X service?” NOTHING. The call was only 5-ish minutes long and everything is in process. So, I highly recommend doing this. 

Some tips:
- You don’t have to provide them with any address, zip code, etc. Providers are not privy to that information unless you are just moving service. But it can speed up the process. 
- Search up the company’s coverage ahead of time. Pick a place that is in the middle of nowhere if you have to. Having the info at the ready is always good.
- Claim ALL residents are moving out. (Or that it’s just you.) They may ask if a different person wants to continue coverage and to transfer the billing. 
- You don’t have to give them a lease/moving date or anything of the sort. Just say you’re comfortable with whatever the shutoff date will be. This will stop any further monthly bills.
- If it’s a large utility (gas, water, electric) say you’re moving to a different state. Some large companies cover multiple states, but again, a quick google search can give you specific states if you want them.
- Many companies now link accounts through phone number. So if you’re canceling to attempt to get a “new customer” deal, make sure to use a roommate’s number that has never been associated with it.
- if they ask “are you sure”, say you’ve signed the lease and they are firm on a different company. Nothing more. 
- Make sure to pay the final bill if there is one. Otherwise they’ll be calling you or even blacklist you if you ever try to use them again.",517,0.94,45,HomesteadInferno,2024-11-14 19:50:40,1grld19

— /r/needadvice is a subreddit for getting advice about things going on in our lives outside of our relationship with significant others, potential significant others, and significant others of days past. Your relationship, your parent's relationships, your friend's relationships... if you are dealing with any person's romantic relationship, it doesn't belong in here. (This is code for ""no romance related stuff"") No dating advice. No hookup advice. No sex related advice, including anything involving rape (even if it happened to you), molestation, or underage sexual activity.

2. Nothing about personal messaging each other - Don't ask or tell posters or other commenters to PM, DM, or inbox you.

3. No sharing/posting to drama subs - Anybody cross posting any threads to the drama causing subs (subreddit drama, any of the SRS, just anything to increase the drama in a thread) will be banned. That just won't be tolerated at any level. Don't tattle on the mods of other subs here either.

4. No revenge submissions - No ""How to get even"" at all, not in submissions, not in comments.

5. No threadjacking or comment qualifiers - Stay focused on OP's problem. If you disagree with someone else's advice, offer some advice of your own with a top level comment instead of debating. If you agree with someone's advice and have nothing to add, just upvote it.

6. No misogyny, misandry, racism, religious intolerance, or similar - Respect one another, even those you disagree with. We're all equal here. It does not matter if you're male, female, null, both, or nongendered. It does not matter where your come from, or what color your skin is. When meeting someone from a different walk of life, treat that person as you would like them to treat you.

7. No lying advice - Don't ask how to lie, don't advise on lying.

8. No references to suicides - Anything related to suicidal ideations are not allowed. For the sake of yours or your family/friend's safety, anything mentioning suicide needs to go to /r/SuicideWatch

9. No soliciting items or funds - Since we allow throwaways, don't solicit money in here. Please view any effort to solicit money in here as a scam. But any need for donations can go to /r/assistance or /r/care.

10. No advertising - Do not link your subreddit (unless it is relevant to the subject matter of the post), your youtube page, your personal website, clickbait, or stuff for sale. Mods are the arbiters of what constitutes advertising.

11. Kinda Safe for work - We know that lots of controversial and personal things get talked about here, and that's fine. Try to keep your titles safe for work by avoiding foul language and graphic descriptions.

12. Nothing about missing persons - Don't ask about how to track someone down or find someone you used to know.

13. No stand-alone jokes. A joke with legitimate advice is fine, but not by itself.

#Ban Appeals

* For ban appeals: Do not delete any of your comments and posts, especially if they were removed by the mods. Deleting submissions looks evasive, and it forces us to choose between your word and our memory. Only the mod that removed you can reinstate you.

needadvice,What should I do in this situation? Please help,"Hello

27F, 5’2”, 155lbs, vapes nicotine, no alcohol or illicit substances, on fentanyl 50mcg/hr, clonazepam 1.5mg, vyvanse 30mg, Dexedrine 5mg, zopiclone 7.5mg, and PRN oxycodone 10mg suppositories (I get 20 a week total) and 100mg gravol suppositories q6h.

I have endometriosis, Adenomyosis, chronically have 5cm+ ovarian cysts on one ovary or the other, a 6cm subserosal uterine fibroid, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, epilepsy, asthma, partial IgA immunodeficiency, chronically elevated ALP, ALT, AST, and GGT enzymes, diverticulosis, chronic severe nausea and vomiting, osteoarthritis, dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine, kyphosis of the cervical spine, raynauds, and they found a 2cm nodule on my bladder that they said is either from bladder cancer or interstitial cystitis. I had a TIA and a miscarriage three years ago, have had 15 kidney infections in five years (no UTI prior), 11 kidney stones in seven years, 3 blood clots in three years, have had my appendix and gallbladder removed (2014 and 2022), and had an ovarian cyst removed 3 years ago. I also have a small hiatal hernia, a small calcified granuloma in my upper left lung, bibasilar atelectasis, PTSD and ADHD. I believe “that’s all”.

I am currently dealing with an increase in my pain levels, specifically pelvic pain (center of pelvis) when my bladder starts to fill up (goes to 8/10 and does not get alleviated when I urinate and in fact usually gets WORSE after urinating and the pain won’t go down for hours), I am waking up pretty much every hour or two overnight to urinate, frequently need to urinate during the day (getting to the point where I need to urinate every hour), am starting to have frequent difficulty in starting urination (takes 2-3 minutes) and have had a few times in the last two days where I couldn’t urinate for hours despite needing to, only being able to urinate by some grace of god (bladder by then is extremely full and am in 10/10 pain, and have had to catheterize before for inability to urinate), and my urine has been cloudy, colorless, and smells very strongly constantly the last two days (despite drinking less than usual and normally my urine was yellow, not colorless). The pain is also starting to get into my flanks (mostly right side) and the sides of my mid back (around the bottom of my ribcage, like when I had kidney stones, except the pain occurs at the same time my pelvic pain occurs, which is when my bladder starts to fill up and while/after urinating). The pain is a sharp, stabbing pain.

Overall, the last two-three days my symptoms have been getting worse. I’m barely getting any sleep, am severely nauseated because of the increasing pain, exhausted, and when I do eat or drink, I get full and nauseous after a couple of bites/sips and have thrown up a few times, quite violently (vomiting would occur randomly, sometimes directly after eating or drink, sometimes a few hours later). When I press down on my pelvis or put any kind of pressure on my pelvis/lower abdomen, specifically in the center, the pain gets worse but no “rebound tenderness” from what I can tell.

Also, there is NO burning pain when urinating and no blood (that I can tell) in my urine.

needadvice,Looking to relocate 100miles from my family ,"Hello

Looking for some advice on how to let my parents know that me, my  family and kids are looking to relocate back to my OH town, we have been in our town for 11 years now.

She came to study and ended up staying because of me. Fast forward and we now have 3 kids.

Every Friday her family travel down to look after the kids for us and ultimately they have an amazing relationship with them.

We have reached a point where our mortgage is due for renewal in June 2026 so still a good way off but that would be when we are looking to go.

I'm excited about the prospect of starting fresh, new job, new house, kids would be excited too.

Where we currently live we have my family close by but can still go 6 weeks without seeing them, and that's why I think it would be a great move as my OH family are so hands on. Retired etc so they have the time I guess.

My issue is how do I tell my mum and dad 

I have 2 brothers we speak daily so they'll be okay, I'll still travel down every few months so no difference really with how often I see them.

But it is giving me anxiety knowing I'll be sitting down to tell my mum and dad (divorced, mum remarried)

How would I best approach this? 

Anyone with any past experience.


Really been on my mind.

But I'm 100% that I want to relocate. I'm applying for jobs already etc to remotely work if possible too.

Thanks ",2,1.0,5,boringmode-enabled,2024-11-14 04:37:11,1gr1zio

TrueUnpopularOpinion,IMPORTANT: We Need To Talk About The Content Policy...,"The Reddit Admins have messaged us and have brought it to our attention that several posts in violation of the Content Policy had been either gone unnoticed or were allowed to remain.

In light of this, we are going to be more strict regarding violating content in the future. Furthermore, we have added extra measures to decrease the amount of content that will be allowed to slip through the cracks.

Please understand that all subreddits on Reddit are required to follow these rules in order to be allowed to exist.

As a reminder, **any** of the following will be considered a violation, and is **not permitted**:

* **Advocating for, justifying, glorifying, or encouraging violence towards ANY group or person** except in self-defense (includes defending or advocating for corporal punishment for children)
* Stating or implying that **certain races or protected groups are genetically or inherently less civilized, less intelligent, more violent, or otherwise inferior as compared to others** (includes mentioning racial crime, intelligence, responsibility, accomplishment, or competency differences without also presenting further context that explains that the differences are not due to inherent or genetic superiority or inferiority)
* **Making any statement or implication that Reddit believes to have the effect of denigrating LGBTQ+ people**, including:
   * Stating or implying that trans (wo)men aren't (wo)men or that people aren't the gender they identify as
   * Criticizing, mocking, disagreeing with, defying, or refusing to abide by people's pronoun requests
   * Stating or implying that gender dysphoria or being LGBTQ+ is a mental illness, a mental disorder, a delusion, not normal, or unnatural
   * Stating or implying that LGBTQ+ enables pedophilia or grooming or that LGBTQ+ individuals are more likely to engage in pedophilia or grooming
   * Stating or implying that LGB should be separate from the T+
   * Stating or implying that gender is binary or that sex is the same as gender
   * Use of the term tr\*nny, including other spellings of this term that sound the same and have the same meaning
* Criticizing, mocking, or expressing contempt towards any protected or vulnerable group based on their identity in a manner that denigrates the group
* **Making negative statements or generalizations about a demographic or protected group** (i.e. ""<People of a certain race> are violent"") or making positive statements or generalizations about a non-protected group in a manner that implicitly or explicitly excludes protected groups or is not meant to apply to other groups (i.e. ""White people are civilized"")
* Advocating for the removal of rights or privileges from a demographic or protected group in a manner that would leave them with less rights or privileges than the general population (unless doing so in a manner that solely advocates for people to be punished for crimes or immoral actions)
* Utilizing slurs in a derogatory manner
* Stating or implying that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or other forms of hate or misgendering are justified, should be acceptable, or aren't hateful
* Arguing that the age of consent should be below 18, or otherwise stating or implying that pedophilia or grooming should be acceptable
* Advocating in favor of rape or engaging in victim-blaming against rape victims
* Initiating or participating in brigades against other subreddits
* Agreeing with any user saying something in violation of these rules
* Posting spam/unsolicited self-promotional content or [threatening, harassing, or bullying](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043071072) a user

JK Rowling is a perfect example. She is by every defenition left leaning, and has been really outspoken about it. The only thing she is vocal about that the left doesn’t like is her stance on transerights and how they are handled. Now everyone seems to hate her, is burning her books and attacks her on Twitter.

TrueUnpopularOpinion,Most of Reddit Suffers from a Severe Case of Trump Derangement Syndrome ,"It’s honestly kind of wild how any mention of Trump—even a casual, unrelated comment—seems to set off a mental rage among a huge chunk of Redditors. It feels like every single thread on Reddit eventually spirals into bashing Trump, no matter the original topic. Sports? ""At least it's not as bad as Trump."" A cute animal video? ""Look at this doggo, unlike that orange idiot."" Cooking? ""Bet Trump can't even cook toast."" You get the idea.

It’s exhausting. I’m not even here to defend the guy—just pointing out that an entire platform can’t seem to break free from turning every discussion into a referendum on one person. And that’s not healthy. Let’s be real: whether you love or hate him, the obsession is on a level that’s not normal. It's like a weird Pavlovian reflex.

I get it, he is polarizing, but this reaction feels beyond politics and more like some weird collective fixation",532,0.8,311,Ok_Yellow1,2024-11-14 14:27:02,1grecxd
